Ross Finlay dips into the budget range of cars available in Britain.
THERE is no clear definition of a budget-priced new car, and the best
that can be done to categorise these vehicles is to set an arbitrary
figure and look at what is available below it. Selecting a showroom
price of #5500 as the upper limit, three manufacturers cater for this
part of the market, and it is curious that they all take a different
approach.
One thing these makes have in common is that their ''budget'' cars are
built in Eastern Europe. Wage rates in the rest of the Continent make it
impossible for manufacturers in Britain, Italy, France, Germany, Sweden
or Spain to match such low ex-factory prices. However, the attraction of
these cars, for some owners, is not just price but also the fact that
they come with a full manufacturer's warranty.
Lada is usually thought of as the classic budget-level make. The
base-model Samara 1.3, in four or five-door form, just squeezes in under
the #5500 mark. It combines the modified Fiat-type mechanical units on
which all Ladas so far have been based, with a more modern body style.
The British importing company virtually dismantles the cars when they
arrive here, repainting them and upgrading the interiors, to make the
Samaras a little less rugged.
The Lada Riva may be outdated in every respect, but it is the cheapest
car on the UK market. Still a 1960s Fiat 124 lookalike, its sales
dropped sharply and then swung back upwards -- in the early part of this
year it sold half as many again as in the same period of 1994 -- as the
importers used their most significant weapon and held the price.
In the showroom the 1.5-litre Riva costs #3995, exactly the same as
the original Riva in 1985. The saloon, and the estate version at #4995,
must be the only vehicles on the market on which 10 years of inflation
has had no effect whatever. Servicing intervals on the Riva are quite
short, but the prices speak for themselves.
Renault has given up French manufacture of the one-time best-selling
5, but it is still on the UK market in the form of the Renault 5 Campus
Prima at #5478. In its heyday, the 5 was able to notch up annual UK
sales of more than 35,000 units. The rest of the range may have faded
away, but the Campus still sold 7353 examples here last year.
Production of the 5 has moved to Slovenia, the now-independent
northern part of former Yugoslavia which is not involved in any way in
the present Balkan war. Renault UK has never had a supply problem with
this car, which uses a 1.4-litre 60bhp engine, and is well enough
equipped as the bargain model of the whole extensive Renault range,
undercutting the entry-level 1.2-litre Clio by very nearly #1500.
Most modern of the budget car designs, and also the smallest, is the
jaunty little Fiat Cinquecento. There is a better equipped SX model, and
also a Cinquecento Sporting which is a real hoot on the road, but the
anchor car of the range is the Cinquecento S at #5450.
Intended mainly as a town car, the tiny 0.9-litre hatchback darts
around in city traffic, and copes with main road work better than you
might suppose. Built in a factory which Fiat equipped in Poland -- which
seems to work at more than 100% of its planned capacity -- the
Cinquecento accounts for nearly half of all European sales in the
mini-car market.
This is the kind of car which British buyers tend to approach rather
tentatively, but four in every five cars sold in this class here last
year were the little Fiats. They have obviously now got over some
original sales resistance to what is, in its own modest way, not only a
cheerful but also a slightly outrageous design.

CARDS in shop windows. You see plenty of them, all over
Universityland. People looking for ''three girls to share flat'', or
''two men to share, plus share of bills'', or simply offering space at
so much a week or a calendar month.
The prices do vary quite a bit, you find. Anything from around #35 a
week to #70, from #160 a month to a surprising #320 -- the latter for a
family-size place, admittedly.
And this, of course, is the time when students really have to start
looking around for room to keep all their books and CDs and other gear.
What's on offer for them?
The universities as such have their formal arrangements. Halls of
residence and flats on campus take care of at least a proportion of
housing needs.
Strathclyde needs room for around 6000 students away from home. It has
Baird Hall on Sauchiehall Street, Clyde Hall down by the riverside.
Glasgow has Woolfson Hall on Maryhill Road. Caledonian has Gibson Hall
and the School of Art should be opening its own place fairly soon.
Typically, it is the first-year and overseas students who get first
chance, for a year at least. A second year may be balloted for.
At Strathclyde, housing officer Jennifer Gilmour deals with the
private rented sector. And it's not students that are her problem, she
says. It is more likely to be landlords offering accommodation but not
quite appreciating the financial viability of students in the current
economic situation.
''Students can only afford so much,'' says Jennifer. ''There's no
point in our taking on a flat that's going to be too much for them.''
It still leaves her with several thousand landlords on a
computer-based register. They stay on as long as there are no problem
areas seen to arise. And it leaves August-September as a pretty hectic
time all round. Term time is looming fast.
''The first thing we do is ask the students what they want,'' says
Jennifer. ''It may be self-contained, sharing with someone, sharing with
a family, whatever.
''Students can be very vulnerable. They are away from home, or have
come from overseas. We help them wherever we can. Advise them on
different areas of the city.
''Most of them prefer somewhere near at hand -- within walking
distance if possible. We limit our accommodation on offer to properties
within a three-mile radius of the university.''
Prices normally come within a range of #35 to #55 a week. A deposit of
#70 is typical -- and is repaid when agreed. A few landlords can forget
this is part of the bargain, apparently.
Family-type accommodation is also available, but in lesser numbers.
Here, a two-apartment flat could be available at just over #53 a week,
with #61 for a three-apartment.
Senior housing officer Ruth MacLennan sums up the Strathclyde
situation: ''Like all the universities, we need properties, but we don't
need problems. I suppose you could say it is a case of -- Look out. The
students should be looking out for suitable places now. And they should
certainly be looking out for proper contracts. You don't want to sign
anything unless it is exactly what you want.''
Sounds like good advice.

LINFORD Christie will run in tonight's Grand Prix meeting in Zurich
after all.
Christie lost his world 100 metres title in Gothenburg after suffering
a hamstring injury in his semi-final.
The British team captain did not compete in the 200m or the sprint
relay at the championships.
Later, after flying to Zurich for treatment, he admitted there was
also a cartilage problem.
British officials said they did not expect him to be back in action
before the meeting in Brussels a week on Friday.
But Christie announced last night after working out at the Letzigrud
stadium: ''I'm running.''
A spokesman for the circuit's richest meeting, which has a budget of
around #3m, confirmed it.
Christie, who still insists he is retiring at the end of the season,
joins a powerful line-up which includes the man who succeeded him as
champion -- Donovan Bailey.
He would clearly not have contemplated taking on such opposition if he
still felt severely handicapped by his problems.
Meanwhile, American Michael Johnson, who made history at the world
championships last week, could earn nearly $2900 a second if he breaks
the men's world 400m record at the same event.
Johnson, who secured a unique double in the 200m and 400m in
Gothenburg, has been paid around $62,000 just for turning up for the
meeting.
If the Texan betters compatriot Butch Reynolds' one-lap best of
43.29sec, set in the same Letzigrund stadium in 1988, he will leave
Switzerland with a further $50,000 plus one kilo of gold -- a total pay
day of around $124,500.
Zurich organisers have always refused to give specific details of the
appearance money paid to athletes. But sources said yesterday that
Johnson was one of the biggest earners at the meeting along with
Algerian world 1500m champion Noureddine Morceli, Kenyan steeplechaser
Moses Kiptanui, and Ethiopian 10,000m world record-holder Haile
Gebresilassie.

FAST-FOOD giant McDonalds yesterday joined the Premier League's
sponsorship family in a #7m deal, much of which will go towards
initiatives to boost match attendances among young people.
McDonalds have been awarded official restaurant status in the deal by
the Premier League, which gives them the right to use the league's logo
in all their marketing activities.
The agreement is worth #1.75m a year to the Premier League clubs and
is initially for two years, but with a further two-year option. Nearly
#1m a year will go towards the youth and family schemes.
Rick Parry, the Premier League's chief executive, said: ''McDonalds
has supported the Premier League with perimeter advertising since 1993
and is, of course, no stranger to football at the highest level through
its involvement with World Cups and European Championships.''
''This deal is particularly exciting for us because of the commitment
for the extension of facilities for families at Premier League grounds.
''I am genuinely delighted to have a name such as McDonalds associated
with us. It is an important deal for the further development of the
Premier League and another real vote of confidence in the quality and
reputation of top-class English football.''

Scotland 3, Greece 0
WATCHED by their senior brothers (closely, we hope), Scotland's
under-21 side did a fine job in disposing of the Greeks and maintaining
their strong challenge for a place in their European Championship
quarter-finals.
The Greeks had been reduced to 10 men before Scotland finally settled
matters but they were always the better team and, indeed, played really
well for most of the night.
The small crowd of 2517 at Rugby Park fully appreciated the skill and
willing work of the home side, who have two more home games to go in
their group, with the next game against Finland, at Broadwood on
September 6, looking like the decider.
The Scots were worth more than the single goal lead they held at
half-time, a goal scored by Dunfermline's Jackie McNamara, and were well
on top when Greek striker Ilias Sapanis was sent off for his second
bookable offence early in the second half.
Goals by Barnsley's Andy Liddell, a penalty, and substitute Simon
Donnelly, of Celtic, gave a far better reflection of their superiority.
It was their fifth successive victory in the group, after having lost
the opening tie against Finland.
With players of the calibre of Stuart Gray, Charlie Miller, Stephen
Glass, Liddell, and Neil McCann, they look well equipped to keep the run
going.
Not surprisingly, coach Tommy Craig could hardly contain his pleasure.
''I'm absolutely thrilled with every one of them, including those who
came on late in the game but if I had to single anyone out, Neil McCann
would be the one.
''I dropped him from the Toulon tournament and I left him out of the
original squad for this match because I didn't think he was tuned up to
be the player he can be. But he gave me a performance and gave us an
extra dimension.
''Andy Liddell also pleased me in his first game in this competition.
He is so unselfish.''
The one disappointment for him was that the booking of Pressley will
mean the Dundee United player will miss the game against Finland.
The Greeks seemed unconcerned about giving away corners but, although
nothing came from three in the early minutes, they didn't look all that
secure when a high ball landed in their midst.
But the goal the Scottish play had earned duly arrived in 16 minutes.
A clearance fell to McNamara on the edge of the box and his firm drive
deflected off a colleague and left the Greek keeper with no chance.
The keeper's team-mates didn't take too kindly to going behind, as
Kiassos demonstrated when he was booked after a wild lunge at Andy
Liddell.
There was always the risk of a breakaway from the Greeks and, indeed,
when one did come Pressley had to charge down a well-struck shot by
Providas.
Sapanis became the second Greek to be booked, for dissent at a
Scottish free kick.
Scotland began the second period in the same attacking vein, with Gray
robbing a Greek defender, surging forward, and hitting a shot that
landed on top of the net.
Greece came back, however, when Giannakopoulos hit a swerving
free-kick that touched the top of the bar before going out of play.
The Greek team suffered a blow in 53 minutes when Sapanis was sent off
after being shown the yellow card a second time. It was a very late
scything tackle on Miller that cost him his early bath and he could have
no complaints. Neither could Jamie Fullarton when he was booked for one
foul too many a minute or so later.
The second goal the Scots had worked so hard to collect came from the
spot in 57 minutes, and there was no doubt about its validity. McCann
went on a meandering run through a couple of tackles before the third
man in line tripped him inside the penalty area. Liddell made a sound
job of the award and Scotland were on their way.
They immediately replaced Fullarton with Neil Murray at the same time
as Greece took off Theodoridis and brought on Lakis. Four minutes it was
Simon Donnelly's turn to be called from the bench, taking over from
Steve Crawford.
The Celtic man was only five minutes in action before he headed in the
third goal at the far post after a well-flighted free kick from his
Parkhead team-mate, Gray.
Substitutes came fast afterwards. The Greeks put on a new keeper,
Georgiou, for Karkanis, and also took off defender Macheridis, bringing
on Grigoriou.
Scotland had to make a change, too, with Brian McLaughlin replacing
the limping McNamara.
he game as a contest was over which made Pressley's harsh tackle on
Providas, for which he was booked, seem a bit foolhardy.
SCOTLAND -- Stillie (Aberdeen), McNamara (Dunfermline), Pressley,
Hannah (both Dundee United), Gray (Celtic), Miller (Rangers), Fullarton
(St Mirren) Glass (Aberdeen), McCann (Dundee), Liddell (Barnsley),
Crawford (Raith Rovers). Substitutes -- Gardner (Hibernian), Donnelly
(Celtic), Murray (Rangers), Hamilton (Dundee), McLaughlin (Celtic).
GREECE -- Karkanis, Mavrogenidis, Kiassos, Theodoridis, Macheridis,
Lygnos, Giannakopoulos, Passalis, Isapanis, Katsambis, Providas.
Substitutes -- Grigoriou, Fyssas, Lakis, Georgiou, Itsakamakidis.
Referee -- L Elofson (Sweden).

GRANNY'S Heilan' Hame is still a vital part of the urban dream. Most
of us live, work, and spend the bulk of our leisure time in towns or
cities. Yet our hearts are in the country. Owning a country cottage
offers the best of both worlds -- the social and economic advantages of
the city, complemented by the quiet charm of the countryside at the
weekends.
The only problem is that buying that dream cottage can become a
financial nightmare. Help is at from an unlikely quarter, however. The
Invercauld estate in Deeside is selling half a dozen properties at
prices from #12,000 to #35,000 -- prices that reflect the fact that they
need renovation or conversion (the estate has applied for planning
consent).
The disposal represents the second tranche of cottages and former
agricultural buildings put on the market by the estate via Savills.
Balintuim Bothy and Knockan Cottage, priced at o/o #20,000 each, will
each provide one-bedroom accommodation on a single storey. Balantuim
overlooks the Clunie Water, south of Braemar. The stone cottage has a
corrugated iron roof. Knockan Cottage is a former but 'n' ben at
Aberarder, close to Balmoral Castle.
Shenval is a former shepherd's bothy standing high in the hills above
the river Gairn. It is now very dilapidated, but comes with plans for
three bedrooms on two storeys and is priced at o/o #12,000. All three
enjoy open views to the magnificent scenery off Royal Deeside.
Balgairn Steading, just outside Ballater, is a former agricultural
building with plans to provide two reception rooms and kitchen on the
first floor, with three bedrooms, bathroom and double garage on the
ground floor. Offers for this, the most substantial of the properties,
are sought in excess of #35,000.
At Gairnshiel, adjacent to the A939 Ballater-Cockbridge-Tomintoul
road, is a group of three buildings . . .
Rinloan Garages (o/o #25,000) and Rinloan Kennels (o/o #20,000) have
planning permission for one- and two-bedroom residences respectively.
Rinloan Steading (o/o #5,000) has no planning permission but could
provide useful outbuildings to the buyers of the garages or the kennels.
All these properties are remote and need work and investment. Ruaraidh
Ogilvie, handling the sales from Savills' Brechin office, says interest
has come from all over Britain -- and from overseas. Most inquirers are
seeking second or holiday homes, but interest has also been expressed by
would-be refugees from the south-of-England rat race -- and writers or
craftsmen who can work from home.
''These properties are not everybody's cup of tea as they do require
total renovation and installation of services,'' he says, ''but for the
adventurous, they represent a great chance to acquire a property in a
beautiful, unspoiled area.''

RANGERS have finalised the signing of Russian international striker
Oleg Salenko, and manager Walter Smith conceded that his spending spree
is over for the moment.
Salenko's work permit was issued on Monday, and the player joined his
new Ibrox team-mates for training yesterday with the powerful suggestion
from Smith that he could be ready to play in the champions' opening
premier division game against Kilmarnock in 10 days.
''Oleg is a little bit behind the other players because the Spanish
season finished later than ours,'' said Smith, ''so he has had no real
pre-season work.
''That starts for him now and we would hope he could be ready for the
first league game. He is a proven goal scorer at the highest level and
we have needed someone of his ability to give us extra cover in that
area.
''There have been times when we have been stretched there because of
the injuries Mark Hateley and Ally McCoist have suffered in the past two
seasons.''
But Smith insisted that there is no way that Salenko's arrival will
mean a departure for either of the other two main front men at the club.
''The burden we have placed on Mark, in particular, has been heavy
over the last two years,'' said the manager. ''Both players are getting
older and we recognise that we required someone to join them.
''They are not on the way out, or anything like it. They are still
there and they will still make valuable contributions to Rangers, but we
knew they needed help and Oleg will give them that help.''
Salenko admitted that he had been influenced in his decision to join
up at Ibrox by his former Dinamo Kiev team-mates, Alexei Mikhailichenko
and Oleg Kuznetsov, who is now back with the Ukrainian champions.
He said: ''I talked to both my Kiev friends and they told me just how
big a club this is. I knew something of that but they told me more. I
wanted to change from playing in Spain and I am sure that this transfer
will be good for me.
Mikhailichenko, who acted as interpreter yesterday, added: ''Oleg is
ideally suited to the game in Scotland. He is brave, strong, and he is
fast. There are other things, too, about his game. He scores goals
regularly and he is a tremendous dribbler. I think that Oleg will be at
home with Rangers.''
Salenko, still just 25, is another player who will reduce the average
age of Smith's squad, something that the manager had been determined to
do this summer.

THE top two teams in Formula One, Williams and Benetton, are expected
to announce today their line-ups for next season, and anything less than
a studied look at the movements being discussed suggests misery for
David Coulthard, who is about to lose his place on the Williams Renault
team to IndyCar driver Jacques Villeneuve.
It appears the Scot will be moving to McLaren Mercedes, but it is my
understanding that Ferrari are considering a late, lucrative bid to
entice Coulthard into their team along with defending world champion
Michael Schumacher, who is about to confirm his move from Benetton
Renault to the famous Italian stable.
Ferrari would try to ease McLaren's anger by offering Gerhard Berger
in return for Coulthard, but it would be the second time the
Woking-based team would have lost out on the Scot. McLaren and Williams
took their dispute over Coulthard to the European Court in Geneva last
summer, but this time, McLaren believe they have secured their man.
Schumacher, however, is believed to have expressed a desire to have
Coulthard race with him, and one of Ferrari's main advisers, Nikki
Lauda, who won the championship for Ferrari in 1975 and '77, considers
Coulthard to have a future in grands prix despite the disparaging
remarks made by the 24-year-old's critics.
There are many who would take delight in seeing Coulthard's career
stall, and during the British Grand Prix last month, when it was
announced Coulthard, who was motoring well, had incurred a time penalty
for speeding in the pit lane, one or two English journalists were
jubilant.
Certain parties took an instant dislike to Coulthard, hailed as the
new golden boy of the circuits, who has rarely been given the benefit of
any doubts, and his departure from Williams will be seen as powerful
evidence of his inability to make it at the top of a demanding sport.
In his first grand prix season and just more than half way through the
course Coulthard, who finished second in Sunday's Hungarian Grand Prix,
is fourth in the drivers' championship and he is still learning about
life in the fastest lane.
Had he chosen to start with a less illustrious team, Coulthard would
not have been under so much pressure to produce the goods, and his
actions would not have been scrutinised so closely, but the legal case
caused him to be contracted to drive with Damon Hill. Team-leader Frank
Williams said there would be no team orders, but Coulthard has felt he
has not received the same treatment.
Minor errors, but ones which can make significant differences none the
less, seem to have been made more often by his back-up team.
He finished a distant second to Hill in Budapest, but said: ''My
performance over the weekend was compromised by a series of ridiculous
mishaps.''
For instance, after the first qualifying session he had secured a
place on the front row beside Hill, and later learned in debriefing that
too much fuel had been put in his car, which meant he was carrying more
weight than necessary.
In final qualifying when he felt he had timed to perfection the start
of his last run, with only four minutes remaining, no-one could find the
fuel and he couldn't go back out.
Yet he took second place behind Hill on the grid but again an error
cost him time early in Sunday's race. The blankets which heat the tyres
were set up wrongly and instead of his tyres gripping the track they
were melting.
Coulthard may have felt privately that too many mistakes were being
made and leaving Williams, with whom he is being paid something like
#500,000 for this season, will not be a wrench
McLaren and Ferrari, who believe they will have better machines next
year, are willing to pay him a salary in the region of #5m for a
two-year contract.
Schumacher would want Coulthard to help refine and develop the Ferrari
car, but although many would see this combination as the most powerful
on the grid, it might suit the Scot's purposes better if he were to go
with McLaren. With them he would be No.1 with Mika Hakkinen.
If he goes to Ferrari he will find Schumacher to be a most demanding
No.1, someone who must be given the best of everything. Johnny Herbert,
No.2 to Schumacher at Benetton, has suffered significantly because
everything is geared to keeping the German, who will be paid
approximately #25m to drive for the Italians, happy.
That will make Schumacher one of the highest-paid sportsmen in the
world putting him up there with America's big-name basketball players
and also the top heavyweight boxers. Jean Alesi is likely to leave
Ferrari and take over from Schumacher at Benetton.

THE worries continued for Scotland yesterday as they attempted to
finalise preparations for one of the most vital international games in
recent seasons, against Greece at Hampden tonight.
Victory would push the Scots towards the finals of the European
Championships and, at the same time, effectively end the challenge which
Greece, dented recently after successive defeats from Russia and
Finland.
But while team-manager Craig Brown had hoped an early season game --
in fact a pre-season game -- would ease his perennial injury problems,
it has not worked out that way.
And now, this morning, Blackburn Rovers' defender Colin Hendry will
face a last-minute fitness test which will decide whether or not he has
shaken off the injury collected at Kilmarnock in a friendly last week.
Fortunately, however, Alan McLaren, of Rangers, yesterday worked out
with the squad and will be in place.
''Colin is doubtful,'' said Brown last night. ''He has been working
out with physio Eric Ferguson, and we will give him all the time he
needs but the odds are against him.''
Indeed, Brown is already looking at alternative strategies if the
blond Hendry fails to prove himself ready.
The versatility Brown has encouraged will now become crucial as he
juggles his players around to compensate for a Hendry absence, if that
becomes the case.
Motherwell's Brian Martin could go in as a straight replacement
without affecting the make-up of the rest of the defence. Or Tom Boyd
could go into the heart of the defence, a role he is now occupying with
Celtic.
And Stewart McKimmie, who ended up in that area in the game against
Russia in Moscow, could be asked to step in there from the beginning.
That would allow the impressive Craig Burley, of Chelsea, to take over a
wide, midfield role on the right.
Today will decide but Brown refuses to allow even this latest upset to
trouble him. The manager remained confident and stressed: ''I have not
even thought about anything other than a victory in this game. That is
what we need.
''I can recognise that if other results go our way, a draw might even
be enough -- but I don't want to consider that. And I don't want the
players to consider that either. This is a game where victory is so
important to this whole nation and that is what we want. We don't intend
to settle for any less.''
Brown has studied the Greek side, at first hand and on innumerable
videos, and he believes that even his depleted squad -- with Paul
McStay, Andy Goram, Duncan Ferguson, and John Spencer among those who
are out -- remain good enough to beat the Greeks.
''They will not be the team I would have expected to see here,'' he
said. ''The last two defeats will have affected them. Instead of coming
to Hampden looking for a point, as they must have anticipated a few
months back, they now have to get something more.
''The two losses will have upset them and changed their outlook. They
will be much more attacking than they would normally be away from home.
That, though, could help us. They will leave more gaps and we will be
able to exploit these openings from midfield.
''This area will be important for us and we do have form players
involved there. Gary McAllister and John Collins have been outstanding
for their clubs and I know that Stuart McCall and Billy McKinlay are
ready for this and looking good.
''If we can dominate there and keep possession then that could be
demoralising for them. I don't want any carelessness because they are
the type of team who can capitalise on one slack moment.
''The players have all been warned about that. We have to be patient,
pass the ball around, and frustrate them. I know that the fans will be
shouting for us to get the ball into their box, but I will tell them to
ignore the crowd. They have to shut their ears to all of that and
concentrate on playing the game and making passes which will eventually
count.
''That is very important.''
Even more important is that the Scots pressure the Greeks at every
opportunity. Patience is certainly a virtue in these European
circumstances but, there are times, too, when caution must be abandoned,
and when our natural instincts for attack are allowed to flourish.
To have that kind of old-fashioned approach may give all of us an old
fashioned Hampden night, one which has a meaningful victory at the end
of the 90 minutes.
Tickets for tonight's match, priced #12 and #14, will be on sale at
the usual outlets and also at the Hampden South Stand kiosk until
kick-off.

NEW life, new work, new venue. Geoff MacEwan's fortuitous move to
Majorca three years ago has pushed his paintings and prints from shadowy
complexity to high-key simplicity. A Miro Foundation award plus a spell
working with Ramon Liull, a top Spanish printmaker, has been productive.
His etching are now in Madrid's prestigious La Reina Sophia Gallery.
The pictures on show span a decade: from a Tom Philips-like Luther
exhibited at Edinburgh's old 369 Gallery in 1985 to Conquest of Love
1995, a set of four small but powerful and upbeat oils. MacEwan also
shows four impressive artists' books produced at Edinburgh Printmakers
in 1991/3.
This new venue, at 33 Barony Street, is perfect for MacEwan's work and
worth a visit in itself.

* ABERDEEN defender Brian Irvine has bravely taken the first steps to
reviving his career.
Just a month ago the former Scotland player was told the news that he
was suffering from multiple sclerosis. But now he is back in light
training in his bid to be playing again this season.
Dons manager Roy Aitken said yesterday: ''Brian is undergoing regular
sessions of hydratherapy to build up his body strength so that he can
step up his training.
''We will do everything possible to assist him and everyone at the
club is pleased that he has able to make this progress.''

VETERAN Jim Bett has refused a new deal with Hearts -- news that has
alerted Dundee United and St Johnstone, who are both keen to acquire his
vast experience to boost their promotion challenges.
Bett, one of the most influential players of his era, said yesterday:
''Hearts offered me a three-month contract but I decided to wait for the
appointment of the new manager before making a decision.
''I spoke to Jim Jefferies and explained that the travelling from my
home in Aberdeen was now becoming a problem.
''I enjoyed my comeback to Scottish football with Hearts. They are a
good club and I wish them well.
''But I must do what I believe is best for me and my family at this
stage of my career.
''I will carry on playing if the right offer comes along.''
Bett also refused a new deal with Aberdeen 18 months ago because he
was disillusioned with declining standards in the premier division.
But Tommy Mclean enticed him to Hearts and Bett's midfield control
kept the Tynecastle side out of relegation trouble and steered them to a
place in the Scottish Cup semi-finals.
Now, it seems odds-on that he will move to Tayside for the final
chapter of an illustrious career.

* NOT everyone likes the idea of a right of way across their land, but
Leithen Lodge comes with an impressively historical one. The medieval
kings of Scotland often crossed its site on an ancient route -- known as
the King's Road -- when they travelled from Edinburgh Castle to
Traquair, near Peebles.
The lodge itself was built in the last century -- where a former
gamekeeper's cottage once stood -- and was later substantially
redesigned by architect Sydney Mitchell.
Considered to be one of Scotland's finest houses in the Arts &amp; Crafts
style, it incorporates the Lochend Archway, built in 1684 for Sir John
Sinclair's house at Dunbar to the design of the classical architect
James Smith. The archway is believed to be one of the first Palladian
structures built in Scotland. It was re-erected at the lodge three years
ago.
Royalty no longer uses the ancient King's Road along the Leithen
Water, but the lodge is a gem in the Borders crown. Situated in a valley
in the Moorfoot Hills which lie between Edinburgh and the Borders, it is
an imposing and dramatic house with impressive facades and is built of
harled stone under slate and tile roofs, surrounded by lush green hills.
The main accommodation is laid out on three floors in the southern
section of the house. The main reception rooms, the drawing room and
magnificent music room, are on the first floor and linked by the
first-floor conservatory. The layout enables the doors to be opened into
the house, allowing the aroma of blossoms to pass through the rooms.
There are suites of rooms on the ground and first floor with a passage
of guest or nursery bedrooms on the second floor. The domestic quarters
are situated to the north of the house and are joined by a service flat
with its own access through the courtyard. At the back of the courtyard
are the former stables and coachhouse.
The house comprises: cloakroom, washroom, eight bedrooms, three
bathrooms, blue dining room, business room/study, green bedroom, China
pantry, kitchen, old kitchen, laundry room, library, study, organ room ,
drawing room, conservatory, and music room.
The flat comprises: utility room, sitting room, kitchen, dining room,
bathroom and two bedrooms. Leithen Lodge comes with 13 acres of gardens,
parkland, woods, and an original walled garden. Offers over #325,000 are
sought for it by estate agents Savills.

ONLY three of the five-strong Scots side that dominated the last world
outdoor championships at Worthing in 1992 have retained their places in
the side for the Adelaide Championships next March.
Missing from the successful Worthing line-up are Angus Blair and
Graham Robertson.
Richard Corsie, Willie Wood, and Alex Marshall retain their places and
are joined by George Adrain and Kenny Logan.
Corsie, who lost out to Tony Allcock in the 1992 singles final gets
the chance to go one better and he and Alex Marshall will defend the
world pairs title they picked up at the Sussex resort.
In the triples, Logan lines up at lead, with Wood in the middle, and
George Adrain skipping.
The line-up in the fours has Logan and Marshall forming the front end,
with Wood playing third, and Adrain again skipping.

BRITAIN'S top professional riders hit Glasgow today for round seven of
the city centre series and Sheffield's Chris Walker, the current leader,
will be going all out to seal overall victory and drive away with the
top prize of a car.
Walker, who races for Peugeot, will need to be firing on all cylinders
to beat off the strong challenge for the Glasgow Grand Prix, which
starts at 7.30.
Backing him up will be team-mates Shane Sutton and Neil Hoban. The
race is still wide open with fellow internationalists Mark Walsham and
Chris Lillywhite, who are lying second and third, sure to turn up the
pressure in this one-hour spectacular based around George Square.
There is a strong amateur representation in the big field and
Scotland's national squad of Roddy Riddle, Anthony Stirrat, Graeme Herd,
and Nicky Hall will be trying to ensure the pros don't get things all
their own way.

OBAN'S Martin Heath is hoping to follow in Peter Nicol's footsteps
when he launches the new season in this week's Singapore Open.
Nicol, the world No.4, has won the event for the past two years -- the
1993 triumph was his first major win -- but he is not defending as he
has geared his preparations towards the Hi-Tec Super Series and will
open his season in the Hong Kong Open in two weeks' time where he will
take on former British champion Paul Gregory.
Unfortunately, Nicol has had to give up his hopes of a third
successive victory in the European Champion of Champions in Monte Carlo
in October. The tournament clashes with the US Open -- another title he
is defending -- from October 19 to 22.
Heath, the world No.33, has split his summer's training between
Scotland and London, and Singapore offers the chance to boost his world
ranking and his World Open hopes.
If he can rise into the top 32 in the September list, he will be
seeded for the world qualifying in Cyprus in November and, therefore, an
improved chance of making his first appearance in the main event.

NOBODY should be surprised if an even more destructive and complete
fighting version of Mike Tyson takes its first bow at the MGM Grand in
Las Vegas on Saturday.
That is the anticipation of Tyson's newly-appointed chief trainer Jay
Bright, a long-time family friend who has seen the former world
heavyweight champion experience the highs and lows of a stormy and
successful career.
But Bright is not expecting to parade the finished article in phase
one of Tyson's high-profile comeback, even though Boston's Peter
McNeeley is not expected to last very long.
It will be a gradual rebuilding process, brick-by-brick, until
Fortress Tyson in ready to rule supreme again, visualises Bright.
''I think this Tyson could be better than the old one,'' forecasts
Bright, convinced that the Ironman has learned enough harsh lessons
about life during three years of incarceration to make him the
utterly-focused fighting man second time around.
''Mike has the ability to be even better because he's stronger
mentally, physically and now he's at his peak. It's going to take a
certain amount of time for things to come back, but that's nature, you
can't rush it.
''It's still there, it may have been buried, it may have been
submerged but it's still there. Whether the interest is still there? I
can't foresee that, but I believe it will.
''He does look a lot better than he ever has; his head movement is
very good, and so is his counter-punching. He's more aggressive. In
flashes he's quicker than he used to be.
''This fight really is the foundation of the house. You can't start
with the roof and the walls and the lovely wallpaper. You have to first
build that solid base.
''It's the real test, but it would be ridiculous to expect him to get
it all back in a couple of months. I'd rather have him concentrate on
his elusiveness, and technique and not just rely on power alone.''

THE rapidly ageing population faces a dire shortage of custom-built
housing.Though Scotland scores better than the UK for the development of
sheltered and retirement housing, research into planning applications
over the last nine months shows there are only seven private schemes and
19 housing association projects in the pipeline in Scotland?
''This confirms my fear that the demographics of the retirement and
sheltered sector tell us one thing, but the industry is not confident
enough to build because of market conditions brought about by the
Government,'' says Howard Packman, managing director of Sheltered
Housing Services, an industry body which carried out the UK-wide
research.
''There should be huge demand as more and more people live longer and
move into the bracket of needing purpose-built sheltered
accommodation.''
Almost one million Scots are over pensionable age. At 17.8% of the
population, there are more retired people than schoolchildren. By 2001
the number of Scots over 75 will have reached 10%. Many of these people
will become frail or disabled, yet the gap between specialist housing
need and supply is growing.
''There is simply nowhere near enough retirement and sheltered housing
to meet the need,'' says Lucy McKenzie of Age Concern's Scottish Office.
The 911,789 Scots over retirement age are faced with a specialist
housing sector which provides accommodation for only 4% of households
where the householder is over retirement age.
Scotland can provide 30,839 sheltered houses for rent, plus 401 ''very
sheltered' houses (specially adapted for the frail and disabled) while
the need is for 15,000 of these. There are also 15,759 ''amenity' houses
-- a quarter of Scotland's requirement.
The private sector provides only about 2000 sheltered and retirement
houses, but as the UK's leading private-sector provider of housing for
the retired pulls out of the recession, three new schemes are under way
in Scotland. McCarthy &amp; Stone went through a bad patch two or three
years ago but is now getting back into its stride.
''But we're not building enough to meet demand,'' says Alan Gosland of
McCarthy &amp; Stone's Glasgow office. ''Having recovered from our difficult
period, we are now keen to meet a rapidly growing market. The
demographics are on our side -- but recently we haven't been able to buy
the land we need.''
After a showflat opened in his Corstorphine development last month,
sales went so quickly that only one flat now remains. Two other schemes,
at Giffnock and Helensburgh, are underway. But Gosland says his next
tranche of land deals will still come nowhere near meeting Scottish
demand.
Typical McCarthy &amp; Stone apartments cost around #60,000 for one
bedroom and #75,000 for two bedrooms. Service charges are from #20 per
week -- providing resident manager, 24-hour emergency call line,
maintenance, cleaning and gardening.

ON THE second day of first leg of the Teacher's Round Britain
Challenge, the two Scottish boats were still holding the upper hand of
the 10-boat Five Nations fleet and leading overall on the water.
After slow progress overnight fighting the strong tide off Dover,
Glendronach, skippered by Oban's John Fitzgerald, overhauled the leading
boat, Dream Of Erin (David Harte, Ireland).
Fitzgerald and Chris Nichol, his first mate from Largs, had a minor
disaster overnight when their anchor line parted while anchored in dead
calm in a contrary tide.
''Suddenly, in the dark we realised the other boats were gradually
catching us, yet there was no evidence of wind anywhere. It became
obvious quickly that we were drifting backwards on the tide towards
them,'' said Fitzgerald.
By mid-morning yesterday the Scotland II crew held longer into an
offshore fog bank and were rewarded with the first of the forecast
south-westerly breeze which built steadily throughout the day. This
advantage allowed them to slip past the Irish boat, which was closer
inshore in less breeze.
By yesterday evening off Beachy Head by Eastbourne, Fitzgerald and his
crew were maintaining their three-quarter-mile lead, moving quickly
upwind in around 12 knots of breeze.
Paul Jeffes, skipper of the second Scottish boat, Lord Inverforth,
which lies third, was attempting to cover a move by the fourth and
fifth-placed Welsh boats skippered by Colin Lyons and Richard Tudor
respectively.
''So far we seem to have been able to find the better speed changes
with the varying winds, which is probably the result of spending a lot
of time tuning up our two boats together during last week,'' explained
the Scotland I skipper.

GEORGE Graham, the former Stirling County and Glasgow prop and now a
rugby league player, has told The Herald that he would be interested in
coming back into the ranks of rugby union now that amateurism is set to
be quashed.
''I'd be telling a lie if I said that I wasn't very interested,'' he
said.
''At the moment I have two years left of my contract at Carlisle, but
my wife wants to come back to Scotland, and the club have always said
that if someone wants me to move, then they would look at the situation.
Now that it is possible to earn money at club rugby, I would want to
look at every possibility.
''I have been training very hard over the summer, and I feel as good
as I have ever done.''
The news has been greeted with barely disguised enthusiasm by his
former team-mates. Jim ''Muff'' Scobbie, Stirling's forward coach,
thinks that Graham would make a real impact in the 15-a-side game if he
were to return.
''George is a great player, and there's no doubt that we have missed
him since he went,'' he said. ''It would be fantastic to have him
back.''
Kevin McKenzie, the hooker with last year's championship-winning team,
also said he would like to see Graham in the red, white, and black of
his old club.
At the weekend, Jim Telfer, the director of rugby and now team
manager, said that rugby league would be the main sufferer when the
15-man game went professional, and the reaction of George Graham to an
innocent inquiry is perhaps an indication of how strongly many league
players feel about their own game.
League may be tougher and more physical in its demands of the human
body, but few of the converts from rugby union profess to enjoying the
game more when they move. The opposite is, in fact, the case.
Freddie McLeod has said that it remains to be seen just what the
outcome of the International Board meeting at the end of August means
for those league players who may want to come back to their original
game, and the question of whether league players who have never played
union would be allowed to join the ranks poses even more problems.
In my book, it would be good to see any league player who wants to
able to play union. Ally Tait, just one example, would make quite a
difference to the Scottish midfield.
Whether the amount of money on offer from our game would be enough to
entice these players back remains to be seen. Whatever, we should now
just let them back in.
The only trouble is that Wales would be a better team. I suppose there
has to be a downside to everything.

BOROUGHMUIR have signed a three-year sponsorship deal with Scottish
Brewers ensuring that the McEwan's logo, a fixture in Scottish rugby for
the past nine years before rivals Tennents came in this year to sponsor
the Scottish league and new Cup competitions, will still be around the
Scottish scene.
When Scottish Brewers bowed out of the national sponsorship scene
three months ago, managing director Collin Wood indicated that the
company would still be involved in the game but was turning its
attention to the grass-roots.
Yesterday's announcement is said to be the first of several
initiatives designed to aid club rugby throughout the season.
The deal is said by McEwan's to be worth a five-figure sum for each of
the three seasons that it will run.
Boroughmuir, who also are still in the running -- along with
Watsonians -- as recipients of the cash which Stirling Fibre millionaire
John Connor wants to plough into a club to create Scotland's first
super-club, are also hoping to profit from a #3.5m local authority
redevelopment at Meggetland.
The Meggetland playing fields, owned by Lothian Regional Council, are
due for a major overhaul and, despite objections by some local
residents, planning permission will be sought from Edinburgh District
Council this week.
The club have a staunch ally, well versed in local government
machinations, in the form of honorary president Eric Milligan, who is
convener of Lothian Regional Council and who was present at yesterday's
sponsorship announcement ceremony.
Lothian Regional Council intends a complete revamp of the local
authority changing-room facilities at Meggetland and the provision of a
running track and all-weather surface. If the development goes ahead,
and it may do so as soon as February of this year, then Boroughmuir
would benefit from a new clubhouse and greatly enhanced stand
facilities.
Wood said yesterday: ''Not only will McEwan's enjoy obvious commercial
benefits from sponsoring a club like Boroughmuir, but I am sure that our
team at McEwan's will be able to help the club meet their objectives
both on and off the pitch.''
Boroughmuir, Scottish champions in 1991, have also been busy during
the close-season, adding to their playing pool. They have signed up a
host of age-group internationalists, including Steven Wands from
Edinburgh Wanderers, Peter Flockhart from Stewart's-Melville, Craig
Hunter from Currie, and Graham Beveridge from Peebles.
Their most significant acquisition, however, is GHK flanker Fergus
Wallace, who most recently captained the Scottish development squad in
Zimbabwe this summer and who, according to Boroughmuir coaching director
Bruce Hay, was attracted to Meggetland by Derek Stark during the
Zimbabwean trip.
Hay said: ''The aim has been to build a strong squad for the new
leagues. I reckon that the demands are going to be so great, weekend in
and weekend out, that a squad of at least 25 is going to be an absolute
must if a club is going to be successful.''
Boroughmuir have an early opportunity to gauge progress since last
season, when they finished fifth in the championship, when they compete
in Euro Cup 95, a five-day tournament in Leiden, Holland, next week.
Other teams involved are Wasps, Blackrock College, Pontypridd, Leiden,
and the Belgian side Reveries.
* WESTERN Samoan rugby union star Fata Sini has joined Salford on a
12-month contract.
Sini follows international team-mate Mike Umaga into rugby league
after his move to Halifax and is Salford's second Samoan signing this
summer. They had already snapped up forward Lokeni Savelio from New

THE physical wounds have virtually healed, but tonight, in Zurich,
Yvonne Murray begins the therapy designed to erase the mental scars of
her World Championship fall during the 10,000 metres final in Gothenburg
last week.
Murray flew out yesterday for the Weltklasse meeting, the $4.8m
extravaganza which is the highlight of the grand-prix season.
Her programme manager, Andy Norman, encouraged Scotland's Commonwealth
champion to get back in action as soon as possible.
''I am running pain-free, and the bruising has cleared up,'' said the
Motherwell runner before leaving for Switzerland. ''I am glad to be back
on track, and want to put the memory of the World Championships behind
me.
''I can't help what happened. It was bad luck, but that's life. You
just have to pick yourself up and carry on. I was very distressed at the
time -- I took it so badly, because I felt good, and was certain I was
in shape to win a medal, possibly the title.
''But I have no intention of letting it spoil my athletics, or ruin my
life.''
This first race back is no gentle reintroduction. In addition to world
5000m gold and silver world medallists Sonia O'Sullivan and Fernada
Ribiero, the line-up includes Gabriela Szabo and Rose Cheryiyot,
respectively fourth and seventh at 5k in Gothenburg, plus Olga
Churbanova, world's fastest this year at 3000m. Add double Commonwealth
3000m champion Angela Chalmers, Lyudmila Borisova, and Yvonne Graham --
respectively world fourth, fifth, and tenth at 1500m -- and you have a
field of intimidating quality.
But Britain's Kelly Holmes, having drained the tank in the service of
her country in Sweden, is unable to cash in on the Swiss pay-day. After
five races and two medals (1500m silver, 800m bronze) she is too tired,
and has too much pride to take the money and jog.
* NEW world triple-jump champion Jonathan Edwards today warned
North-East athletics fans not to expect any more miracle leaps in next
week's BUPA Challenge match between Great Britain and the USA.
Edwards was back on Tyneside preparing for Monday night's clash at
Gateshead, following his amazing world-record double of 18.16m and
18.29m in Gothenburg last week.
But he stressed: ''I'll be very surprised if I jump 18 metres again
this season. I want to enjoy myself in the next few weeks and say a big
thanks to all my supporters.
''It will be totally different to the world championships, where the
adrenalin is running and you produce something extra.
''All I can say to people is come and watch me, but don't expect an
1830 jump.''
Edwards has lined up a further six meetings this summer, but has
decided to take the winter off to prepare for next year's Olympics in
Atlanta.
''The Olympics are paramount to me,'' he said. ''I'll miss the indoor
season and hopefully be fresh for a big year next year.''

IT was billed as the brave new world of house-buying -- a deal that
guaranteed the customer could not lose. Needless to say, there has been
no shortage of interest, and the offer is proving one that discerning
house-hunters are finding hard to refuse.
The only ''catch'' is the customer's: a brand-new luxury home in
Bearsden built by Adam (Scotland). Adam launched the initiative to allow
clients to overcome their fears about selling their existing home, to
forget the stories of properties stuck on the market for months and
months as advertising bills go through the roof, the spectre of upset
prices, talk of that dirty word ''bridging''.
Under Adam's unique House Exchange Plan you can buy your dream home
safe in the knowledge that, far from losing out, you can end up quids
in. But potential buyers had better move fast -- the plan, launched at
the beginning of last month, ends on August 31. It's aimed at clients
purchasing one of Adam's exclusive homes at Henderland Gate, a new #6.5m
development of luxury flats and villas in tranquil surroundings just off
the Switchback in Bearsden.
After reserving one of the villas, the client's own home is valued by
an independent valuer and a mutually acceptable minimum part-exchange
price is agreed with Adam.
Once missives for the purchase of the new home are concluded, your
property will be marketed by a leading estate agent, with all
advertising costs and agent fees to be borne by Adam. Should your
property be sold for more than the agreed minimum value, you keep all
the proceeds. Should it sell for less, or not at all, Adam will still
pay you the agreed minimum price in part exchange for your new home.
''We've been delighted with the response. We are giving the client the
confidence to go ahead and put their house on the market because we are
picking up the estate agents' fee and advertising and providing a
minimum fall-back. It's a no-lose situation,'' said David Nelson,
managing director of Adam (Scotland).
''People are worried about spending weeks and weeks advertising with
the costs going up, worried about two mortgages. What we are doing is
underpinning that. We are saying we will take it on the chin.
''What we have found is that people have been coming on to the site
for a considerable period of time and have obviously taken the view that
the site wasn't ready yet, but now it's make your mind up time.''
The development comprises a range of two and three-bedroom flats (28
in all) and 15 four and five-bedroom detached homes. All are built to
the highest standards offering exceptionally spacious accommodation and
a very high level of specification. People have now begun to move into
the first of two phases of flats which was finished recently.
''We have now commenced the landscaping and final works on the first
phase of flats which give a good idea of the standard the whole
development is going to achieve,'' said David Nelson.
''Up to now people have only had the development model or a brochure
-- although we have been selling ahead of completion. But people
interested in the next phase of the development can actually come to see
the finished product.
''The flats have been selling so quickly that we haven't had time to
have a showflat, but we do have a completed flat which people can look
round.''
The second and final phase of 14 apartments is now under construction
for entry in spring next year. Like the first phase, all have garages,
parking, and balconies and there is a video door entry system.
On the house front, the first residents will move in at the end of
this month. The show home, a five-bedroomed ''Carnoustie'' detached
villa with interior design by Decorum of Sauchiehall Street, opened in
March.
The rooms are generally much larger than usual, and the double doors
into the lounge, the patio doors in the dining room, the generous
hallways on both ground and upper level, the large ensuites, and the
extensive landscaped gardens all serve to give a feeling of space. A
choice of stylish bathrooms and fully equipped quality kitchens --
designed to maximise on space and storage -- are included in the price.
The popularity of the development has much to do with its location --
nestling on a secluded wooded hill at the end of Henderland Road, with
splendid views over the surrounding area and, on a clear day, to the
Erskine Bridge and Clyde estuary.
''The development has been designed so that everybody has got a
view,'' said David Nelson. ''Another reason for the continued popularity
is the amount of space in these flats and houses. In the five-bedroomed
house, for example, even the fifth bedroom can take a double bed, and
all the kitchens -- even those in the flats -- have been designed to
take a table for dining. All of the flats have balconies leading off
from the lounge, most with a view.''
Kitchens are fully fitted, with co-ordinated wall tiling, and come
complete with oven, hob, and cookerhood, fridge/freezer, washer/drier,
and dishwasher.
Each flat is supplied with satellite television, and there is an
aerial point in every room. The villas have living flame fireplaces and
patios leading to the gardens, and the developers offer a carpets and
curtains package.
Said David Nelson: ''When people move in, all they have to do is put
their furniture where they want it, plug in the television and relax.
''Because we are a small, specialist company, we can build in other
requirements.
''The company believes in traditional value and space, and we are
pleased that the buying public obviously agrees.''
Henderland Gate is close to shopping and transport facilities as well
as being within easy reach of the city centre. Prices are from #98,000
for a two-bedroom flat and from #198,000 for the Braemar four-bedroom
detached villa.
''The flats have been selling so quickly that we haven't had time to
have a showflat, but we do have a completed flat which people can look
round.''

THE Perth Badminton Open from September 1 to 3 not only boasts the
biggest prize fund on the Friends Provident British Grand Slam Tour but
will also feature all the country's leading players.
The organisers confirmed yesterday that former European champion
Darren Hall and Jo Muggeridge will defend their singles titles.
National champions Bruce Flockhart and Anne Gibson will head the
Scottish contenders in the run-up to team selection for next year's
Olympics in Atlanta, with only the top two players sure of a place in

AFTER having missed out on the 1991 finals in Paris, Scotland return
to the European Nations' Cup in Dublin today, but any thoughts of an
easy passage have been dispelled.
In their nine-match build-up, Scotland managed only one victory, a 3-1
success against France, after having lost 4-1 to the French in the
opening game in a three-match Test series.
This is certainly not the form of potential medallists, but manager
Alistair Tait explained: ''We have not gone out of our way to play easy
sides in the course of our preparations.'' Those demanding assignments
against the likes of England, Ireland, Canada, and the USA could prove
decidedly more difficult than some of the teams they will play in
Dublin.
Tait, nevertheless, will be concerned by the absence of real class in
the side brought about by the withdrawals from the squad of eight
players, including Andrew Hay, Paul Doney, Derek Cunliffe, Alan Sword,
and Philip Webster through injury or unavailability.
Considerable pressure will now be placed on the shoulders of David
Leiper at full back, not just for his experience, but also for his
vision, composure, and expertise at set-pieces.
Their opening game tonight is against championship favourites Holland,
who have produced some flashes of brilliance in beating Ireland 5-0, and
England 5-1 and 5-2. Both these countries have beaten Scotland
conclusively, and so the signs are ominous.
It is likely to be a damage-limitation exercise against the Dutch but
in the following games -- against Belgium, Wales, and France -- the
Scots could pick up sufficient points to fulfil Tait's target of ''a
top-eight finish.'' Today's games:
Pool A -- Belgium v Wales, Spain v France, Scotland v Holland.   Pool
B -- Ireland v Belarus.

ALLAN Lamb blamed alcohol for sparking ugly crowd scenes that soured
yesterday's NatWest trophy semi-final at Headingley. Police and stewards
had to rush into the Western Terrace as fights broke out while Lamb's
Northamptonshire team were beating hosts Yorkshire by 87 runs.
''What makes me sad is that people come to watch cricket and then you
get behaviour like that,'' said Lamb. ''I think it is down to alcohol
because these things always happen later in the day. I don't know what
the answer is unless you ban alcohol.''
Yorkshire have promised to launch an investigation into the crowd
scenes. Several pieces of fruit were thrown at Northants fielders, but
Lamb made light of those incidents. ''Our boys were feeling a bit hungry
anyway,'' he said.
Fifteen spectators were arrested, with several others ejected from the
ground.
At Glamorgan, Dermot Reeve's Warwickshire waltzed into a third
successive NatWest final by beating the home -- and silencing a Cardiff
crowd that three weeks ago had hurled verbal abuse and dangerous objects
at them.
The Welsh county increased stewarding and policing levels to prevent a
repeat of yobbish scenes during last month's Sunday League game.
Warwickshire won by eight wickets after having bowled out Glamorgan
for 86, keeping alive their dream of emulating last year's hat trick of
titles. Tim Munton was man-of-the-match for his 12-over spell of two for
18. Scores:
At Cardiff, Glamorgan 86; Warwickshire 88-2. Warwickshire won by eight
wickets.
At Headingley. Northamptonshire 286-5 (R J Bailey 93no, A J Lamb 63);
Yorkshire 199. Northants won by 87 runs.

A LOOPHOLE in European legislation is allowing imported eggs to be
packed and sold in this country as if they were home-produced, it was
claimed yesterday.
The Scottish Egg Producer Retailers Association, which is concerned
about the decline in numbers of eggs produced in Scotland is campaigning
to have country of origin printed on all pre-packed cartons.
Dennis Surgenor, secretary of the association, said he believed most
shoppers in Scotland wanted to buy home-produced eggs. However, European
regulations meant it was possible to import eggs from Italy, grade and
pack them in England, and present them on the Scottish market in a
pre-pack marked with a Scottish name and address.
It was also possible to have eggs packed in another EU member state
with a Scottish packer's name and address on the carton.
Members of the Scottish association took their campaign for
country-of-origin stamping to London recently, but found that the large
packers, represented by the National Egg Marketing Association, were
against the proposal.
Mr Surgenor said that he could only assume their opposition was based
on the large number of imported eggs they were handling. ''At present we
have in Scotland eggs imported from outwith the UK sold in a pre-pack
with a Scottish address, giving the impression that the eggs in the pack
are 'local','' he said. ''This is a marketing con trick and one way of
stopping it would be to mark all pre-packs with country of origin. It is
done for fruit and vegetables, why not eggs?''
In a small survey he found that purchasers used the address of the
packer as a means of determining the nationality of the egg. All those
who took part chose a pack with a Midlothian address as representing
Scottish produce -- but the eggs actually came from the Republic of
Ireland.
All pre-packs are stamped with a packing station number which
identifies the country of origin. These codes are not known to the
general public, however.
Mr Surgenor accepted that Scottish producers were at present meeting
only 65% of the home demand for eggs. A move to stamp country of origin
on packs could lead to a boost in Scottish sales and would give
producers the confidence to increase production, he suggested. ''We
would prefer Scottish eggs for Scottish customers.''

INTERNATIONAL scrum-half Gary Armstrong makes his comeback after a
16-month lay-off in a charity game in Edinburgh on Sunday.
Armstrong, 28, who made his last appearance in the Scotland game
against Ireland in 1994 when he tore tendons in his thumb before
suffering a devastating knee injury in pre-season training almost
exactly a year ago, has been working his way back to fitness since
receiving the all-clear from the medics three weeks ago.
The charity match at Bangholm is being hosted by Trinity Academicals
in memory of Dr Calum Guthrie, an Accies player who died, aged 29, from
a brain haemorrhage while on a skiing holiday in France earlier this
year.
Armstrong will be joined by a number of other Scottish
internationalists in the game between a Trinity Academicals-Scottish
Select and Edinburgh Royal Infirmary-Scottish select. The admission
charge -- #2 for adults and #1 for children -- is in aid of the Scottish
Orthopaedic Research Trust into Trauma organisation, the charity
nominted by Calum's parents.
Event organiser Allan McLeod said: ''Gary has benefited considerably
from SORT and is keen to show his appreciation.''
As revealed in The Herald, Armstrong has now recovered his appetite
for the game and is determined to force his way back into the Scottish
international side.
Yesterday, he said: ''It's been a long, hard struggle back to fitness.
I was four-and-a-half months off work and made scores of trips to
Edinburgh after the operation to put the left knee back together.
''I was invited to take part in the charity game on Sunday and it's an
ideal way to get back. I've been taking contact on the knee at training
and don't seem to have suffered any adverse effects.''
Surgeons used carbon-fibre material to reconstruct Armstrong's knee,
which was the same one damaged in a club game three years ago.
''I could have opted for the Sevens at Kelso or Selkirk but I don't
reckon that my match fitness is quite good enough to take part in a
sevens tournament. The charity game is ideal,'' he said.
Among the other internationalists who have indicated that they will
take part are Gavin and Scott Hastings, Ian Jardine, Graham Shiel, Craig
Chalmers, Peter Wright, Kenny Milne, Kevin McKenzie, Stuart Campbell,
and brothers Fin and Jim Calder.

UK milk producers who exceeded their quota in the ''milk year'' which
ended on March 31 will have to pay penalties totalling just over #48m,
the Intervention Board announced yesterday.
The levy will be #43.4m (30.45p per litre) for wholesale deliveries
and #4.7m (16.26p per litre) for direct sales. Across the UK wholesale
milk production exceeded quota by 152 million litres and direct sales
quota was exceeded by 15.4 million litres.
The levy will be paid by the purchasers of milk -- such as Scottish
Milk or Wiseman Dairies -- who will then collect the money due from
individual farmers who were over quota. Scottish Milk said it would be
issuing a statement to producers shortly.

RYDER Cup captain Bernard Gallacher yesterday backed his European team
to upset the odds and defeat the USA side that Lanny Wadkins has chosen
for the biennial clash in Rochester, New York, next month.
The United States have been quoted as 2-5 favourites to retain the
trophy at Oakhill Country Club on September 22 to 24, after Wadkins gave
his two ''wild cards'' to the experienced Curtis Strange and Fred
Couples.
But Gallacher said: ''I am not surprised by his choices and I don't
want to dwell on the merits of the American team.
''I believe there were a lot of good things for us in last weekend's
US PGA Championship and I am confident that we have the ability to win
the Ryder Cup back.
''There was a big European entry in the tournament and I was pleased
to see Miguel Angel Jimenez, Constantino Rocca, Sam Torrance, Jose Maria
Olazabal, and Nick Faldo all return sub-par scores.''
Gallacher singled out Scotland's Colin Montgomerie for special praise
after his play-off defeat by Australia's Steve Elkington at the Riviera
Club in Los Angeles.
He said: ''I am disappointed he didn't win, because he deserves to win
a major, but I believe he is the best player in the world at the
moment.''
The European team will be announced on August 28 and Gallacher knows
he faces selection problems.
With just this week's Czech Open and the German Open on August 24 to
27 to go before the team is finalised, Faldo, Ian Woosnam, Olazabal, and
Sweden's Jesper Parnevik are all outside the top 10 places in the Ryder
Cup points table which guarantee selection.
Gallacher said: ''There are up to five places in the team up for grabs
and it is up to the players to play themselves into the team.
''I believe it is a good situation for us, because it means that
players who force their way into the team will be in form at the right
time.''
Gallacher's biggest task will be choosing his two ''wild cards'', but
he added: ''It was difficult for Lanny Wadkins and it has always been
difficult for me. There is a lot to consider.''

<HEADLINE>Sheep scab publicity call</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>22</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>976863265</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A CALL for the names of farms where sheep scab is found to be
published in the Veterinary Record -- the vets' professional magazine --
has been made by Terry Boundy, a Welsh vet regarded as one of the UK's
leading experts on sheep health.
Arguing for scab to be classified again as a notifiable disease, Mr
Boundy said: ''The country is in a mess with this scab and we, as vets,
do not know where it is. Publishing the names would be better than this
busines of picking up some whispered comment at the market. Farmers
would have to do something about it.''
Mr Boundy insists that when scab is discovered it should be eradicated
by a programme of treatment supervised by officials from the relevant
agriculture department.
Although opposed to compulsory routine dipping, he accepts dipping is
still the most effective way of combating the problem in large flocks.
In view of the various health scares arising from the use of
organophosphorous dips -- and the fact that some farmers fail to ensure
the sheep are totally immersed -- he advocates the use of trained
specialist operators.
A Scottish Office spokesman said that while scab was no longer a
notifiable disease it was still subject to welfare legislation and
farmers were obliged to treat it.
* AN Ayrshire dipping contractor, Hugh Blythe of Nether Culzean Farm
near Minishant, said yesterday that he had found it impossible to obtain
the type of gloves prescribed for use when handling OP dips. ''In my
experience they are just not on the market,'' he said.
Mr Blythe said the recommended gloves were supposed to be unlined,
made of PVC or Nitrile, half a millimetre thick and 300 millimetres
long. He had been unable to get any which met all of these
specifications and was using very thick, long rubber gloves -- ''but the
dip does eat away at them''.
A spokesman for the Health and Safety Executive said several companies
had imported gloves which met the specification. Anyone experiencing
difficulties should contact the HSE National Responsibility Group for
Agriculture at Stoneleigh, Warwickshire.
Part of the problem may centre on the definition of unlined. Some
gloves have protective material sprayed on to the cotton outer part.
These are not recommended because chemicals could seep down inside.
Others made from PVC or Nitrile may have a flock lining sprayed on after
manufacture. They are considered safe.

SCOTLAND'S recent domination of the girls' home international golf
series looks to be at an end after they suffered a 9-0 whitewash at the
hands of England on the opening day at the Northope Country Park
yesterday.
The Scots were never in contention after having lost all three of the
morning foursomes matches, although the final margin probably flattered
England a little.
Of the individual matches, three went to the eighteenth and four more
were not settled until the penultimate hole.
''We actually played some very good golf but on the day we were beaten
by a superb side and have no complaints,'' said Scotland captain Fiona
Rennie.
Scotland needed to make in-roads at the top of the singles order but
that never materialised. Laura Moffat was two down at the turn to the
English girls' champion Rebecca Hudson, and Heather Stirling went three
down to the big-hitting Gillian Nutter.
Hudson closed out victory by 3 and 1 while Nutter withstood a strong
comeback from Stirling before finally taking the match on the home
green.
Lower down the order, only Shona McEwan was ahead after nine but she
failed to maintain her advantage and also lost at the last, to Lisa
Walters.
Scotland will be looking to return to winning ways when they take on
Ireland in their second match of the series today.
However, that will not be easy, as Ireland also looked impressive in
an 8-1 victory over Wales. Results:
England 9, Scotland 0 (English names first) Foursomes: R Hudson and G
Nutter beat L Moffat and S McEwan 1 up: G Scase and L Wixon beat C
Hunter and L Mackay 2 and 1; L Walters and J Clingan beat H Stirling and
F Lockhart 2 and 1.
Singles: Hudson beat Moffat 3 and 1; Nutter beat Stirling 1 up;
Walters beat McEwan 1 up; Clingan beat G Melvin 4 and 2; Scase beat
Hunter 2 and 1; Wixon beat K Burns 3 and 2.
Ireland 8, Wales 1.

LOMBARDIC, groomed for a career over hurdles last season, can land a
big handicap on the Flat by taking the Tote Ebor today at York.
The Private Account colt, who showed useful form on the level for
Barry Hills in 1994, was sent to David Nicholson in the autumn of last
year to be prepared for a novice campaign, however, he cut little ice in
two outings.
Since moving to Julie Cecil's stable in the spring, Lombardic has
shown himself a tough and progressive animal -- just the type for this
#100,000-added race.
He began this campaign with a respectable fourth to Wishing -- who
reopposes here -- in a handicap over course and distance.
More forceful tactics paid dividends in the valuable Old Newton Cup at
Haydock next time, in which Lombardic beat the progressive Diaghilef.
Making all the running, he was asked for an effort with more than a
furlong to run and responded generously to fend off the runner-up by a
neck.
Bearing a 3lb penalty, Lombardic once again made all, this time in a
three-runner Rated stakes at York, beating Glide Path by threequarters
of a length.
Both victories were achieved by less than a length but that does not
mean Lombardic's winning run is about to end.
He is simply not the type to win races by wide margins -- a
contributory factor towards his lenient mark here.
The step back up to a mile-and-threequarters will suit the
four-year-old, as will the fast ground, and York's reputation as a
friendly track for front-runners makes Lombardic (12-1 with the
sponsors) even more appealing.
Of his 20 rivals, Michael Stoute's progressive Embracing may provide
the biggest danger.
This Reference Point filly attempts a five-timer after wins at
Hamilton, Sandown (twice), and Goodwood, and has been the subject of
quite an ante-post gamble.
* MONDAY'S meeting at Hexham has been thrown into doubt due to the hot
weather. The going at the course has been officially described as hard
and officials will hold an inspection at noon on Saturday to decide if
racing can take place.

INDIVIDUALITY is the keynote where Tilbury Douglas is concerned. It is
the company's proud boast that it has no fewer than 17 different house
styles incorporating a variety of interesting brick types, a range of
window styles and distinctive features such as cornerstones, rendering
and pediments, on its 13 existing and seven planned new sites around
Scotland.
But innovative though this builder most certainly is, its philosophy
remains solidly old fashioned in the best sense. Not for them the speed
and convenience of timber-frame construction. Instead they prefer to use
the traditional brick-by-brick (and more of them too) skills of earlier
eras, to create homes of quality and distinction.
''Our traditional building methods may take a little longer, but the
finished result is well worth it,'' declares Jan Jeram, sales and
marketing director for Tilbury Douglas.
''The interiors are further proof of our quality, with their generous
proportions, modern comforts such as central heating and double glazed
windows, plus good storage facilities.''
Currently Ms Jeram explains: ''We have a lot of sites under
construction, and many new ones coming on stream. We recently replanned
all of the exterior finishes of our houses and introduced a lot of new
elevations -- they are the same houses inside, but it's made them more
attractive and appealing. That has proved to be very successful. We have
had a very good year so far, and we look to increasing that success as
soon as things get back to normal after the holidays.''
In an extremely competitive marketplace, Tilbury Douglas has been
making strenuous efforts to satisfy the demands of their customers,
coming up with incentive packages, tailor-made both to individual sites
and individual purchasers.
On the company's Wallace Glen development for example, it has seen
around 20 houses sold over a two-month period, following the
introduction of a #4000 furniture voucher. Purchasers taking advantage
of the offer, have been able to select furniture to that value from Reid
Furniture.
''It's our policy,'' comments Jan Jeram, ''to make it as easy as
possible for people to purchase one of our houses and with this offer
they can treat themselves to furniture for their new home.''
One of the most recent developments, The Nursery at Law, Lanarkshire,
is a community of 60 one-bedroomed cottage flats and two and
three-bedroomed villas. With prices starting from #31,995 Jan Jeram
forecasts: ''We expect The Nursery to be very popular given its central
location. Together with the quality and competitive prices of the homes,
it is likely to have strong appeal.''
So what does the company have on offer around its sites just now?
At Cumbernauld, The Cedars offers two and three-bedroomed
semi-detached villas from #54,995; three-bedroomed semi-detached
bungalows from #74,495; and three and four-bedroomed detached villas
starting at #80,495. The Green at Johnstone has three and four-bedroomed
semi-villas from #63,750, while at Baillieston, Springhill Park, offers
two and three-bedroomed villas from #52,490 with two and three-bedroomed
semi-villas from #61,495.
Paisley's Abercorn Estate has one, two and three-bedroomed homes from
#28,495 while at Beith, Alder Grove's three-bedroomed detached bungalows
start from #75,995; with three and four-bedroomed villas offered from
#70,965.
At Ayr, Heathfield has two and three-bedroomed semi-villas from
#54,995 with three and four-bedroomed detached villas from #77,995 while
at Troon, The Fairways has three-bedroomed semis from #61,495. Avongrove
at Strathaven offers two-bedroomed terraced villas from #48,995 while in
Central Region Stirling's aforementioned Wallace Glen, Broomridge,
offers two and three-bedroomed semi-villas from #58,995 and three and
four-bedroomed detached villas from #75,495.
Not far away New Carron Village at Falkirk, gives a choice of two and
three-bedroomed terraced/semi-villas from #50,995 with three and
four-bedroomed detached villas starting from #69,995.

INSURANCE broker Sedgwick's chief executive Sax Riley seemed a little
uncertain yesterday whether he was issuing a profits warning. The City
certainly thought so and knocked 10p off the shares to a year's low of
127p.
That is a blow to a company which, because of its international spread
with just a third of its business in the UK and market dominance in some
areas, is of sheer necessity an essential player in the probable
reorganisation of the broking sector.
Mr Riley said the second half would not mirror the first which saw
virtually unchanged pre-tax profits of #63.1m.
The problem is that UK commercial rates have fallen by about 20% in
the last couple of months with property particularly affected. That
reflects both general over-capacity in writing business by British
insurers who are also faced by more and more larger companies
self-insuring while the Continentals find the UK an attractive long-term
place in which to do business and so are buying market share.
A weakening dollar knocked #3.5m off interim profits with another #2m
slippage likely if current exchange rates prevail. The United States
accounts for a similar proportion of business as the UK.
Sedgwick is cost cutting by amalgamating its Sedgwick Payne and
Sedgwick Europe businesses to increase its global coverage and
cross-fertilise product sale between commission business and consultancy
on matters such as employment and the environment.
It is possible it could do a deal with a High Street bank to sell its
insurance products but, like everyone else, Sedgwick is waiting for the
return of consumer confidence. At present, it is using independent
financial advisers.
Significantly, while it held #649m gross cash at end June, it refused
to say how much was client money and how much was directly owned and so
leading to conjecture about the size of the war chest.
Full-year profits look like slipping about #4m to #90m. The interim
dividend has been held at 3p but an increase in the final to 6.75p is
possible for an attractive 6.6% yield on a stock which has decided
speculative possibilities.

GRANITE CITY CLASSIC: By SCOTT CROCKETT
A PROFESSIONAL course record which has stood for a quarter of a
century will be broken at Hazlehead today when the #12,500 Granite City
Classic tees off.
No pro event has been staged at the Aberdeen municipal course since
Peter Oosterhuis carded a three-under-par 67 during an exhibition match
in 1970 to herald the opening of the new clubhouse.
With three new tees in place since then, whoever returns the lowest
card in today's first round of the reduced Tartan Tour event will have
the honour of succeeding the Sky Sports presenter.
Originally planned as a 72-hole tournament, the event has had to be
cut to 36 holes, with the prize-fund similarly halved after proposed
funding from Aberdeen District Council did not materialise.
However, SPGA officials admitted pleasure at seeing the tournament,
even in its reduced state, returned to the Tartan Tour schedule after an
absence of nine years.
Sharing the joy will be Montrose pro Kevin Stables -- who will at last
get the chance to defend the title he won at Royal Aberdeen away back in
1986.
* BRITISH Amateur champion Gordon Sherry made a steady start to the
Canadian Amateur Championship at Toronto Golf Club yesterday, carding a
one-over-par round of 71 to trail first-round leader Mike Brewer by five
shots.
The Kilmarnock Barassie player, who controversially opted out of his
own country's flagship tournament in to play in Canada, recovered well
from a disappointing start. He ran up a double-bogey 6 at the 448-yard
third but hit back with a birdie at the eighth.
The 21-year-old birdied both of the par-5s on his inward half and is
well placed to qualify for one of the 56 matchplay places following the
final strokeplay round today.
* PALACERIGG'S Phyllis Gray achieved a last-minute success in the
Daily Express Glenmuir Women's Championship Scottish qualifying at
Dalmahoy yesterday.
The 48-year-old, who has been playing the game for only six years,
posted a two-under-par round of 66 across the West Course at the West
Lothian venue.
That proved good enough to snatch a late win from Elaine Wilson, of
Craigie Hill, by a single stroke. The 22-year-old three-handicapper had
held pole position all day with a one-under-par net score of 67.
Both competitors will now represent Scotland in the national finals of
the tournament at Palherio, in Madeira, in November. Leading scores:
66 -- P Gray, Palacerigg, (27). 67 -- E Wilson, Craigie Hill, (3).

RECENT upheavals in the life insurance sector, such as the move to
full commission disclosure, have increased competition in the industry
and there are clearly too many players in the market.
Yet there has been little major rationalisation as yet. Indeed, more
companies have been established as banks and building societies have set
up their own in-house operations.
Yet it is inevitable that some of the smaller companies will find it
difficult to carry on. One, London Life, has recently closed its life
fund to new business and there are bound to be others which follow its
example or are taken over.
General Accident is keeping a close eye on the industry with a view to
making acquisitions, though chief executive Nelson Robertson yesterday
indicated expansion would also occur organically.
He sees opportunities arising as companies reposition themselves in
the market and as rationalisation gets under way. The search for
acquisitions is not limited to the UK. The group is also keen on the
Asia-Pacific region. Rex Parker, GA director for the region, explained
that there were a number of takeover possibilities, especially of
under-capitalised family run insurance companies.
GA itself is in good shape to make acquisitions, given low gearing and
a strong asset position, with the per share figure of 556p up 25% on the
end of 1994, and the improvement in its operating ratio (claims plus
expenses as a proportion of premiums) which now stands at a shade under
107%.
In the first six months to the end of June taxable profits jumped to
#256.3m, up 24%.
The insurance cycle is heading down and GA's second-quarter profits
were barely ahead at #143.4m but the trough will be shallow compared
with past experience. Bob Scott, head of GA's UK operations, is already
talking of a hardening in motor rates, which lead the market, by the end
of the year.
GA's UK motor rates were reduced by 5% at the beginning of the year
and generally have flattened out. Household rates are down 15% since
last autumn and are thought to have a little further to fall. Commercial
rates have only recently started to soften so will probably not bottom
out until next year. The group is concentrated in the smaller company
sector where competition is less fierce.
The rate declines being seen bear no comparison with the movements in
previous cycles, largely because the insurance companies now have access
to so much information on which to base their prices, as a result in the
explosion in cheap computer power availability of computers.
GA's present life side is trading well under the circumstances with
first-half profits up 13% at #29.3m. New UK annual premiums were down
22% but single premiums more than doubled owing to the success of a
guaranteed bond.
Second-quarter UK underwriting surplus dropped from #63.2m to #53.1m
with the trend likely to continue in the rest of the year, but this is
being offset by improvement in North America.
In the US, the first-half underwriting loss was trimmed from #68.3m to
#49.6m. and, while lower weather losses contributed much of this
decline, GA says there is an underlying improvement which will be
maintained.
The US side has finally got a handle on the involuntary motor
business. State authorities force all motor insurers to take on a
proportion of otherwise uninsurable drivers if they want to carry on
business in the state. GA's voluntary motor business is actually in
profit and Walter Farnam, who is in charge of the US operation, says the
volume of involuntary business is falling while premiums are rising.
Canadian losses were halved to #17.8m with the full benefits of
premium rises still to come. The European figures show no improvement
but GA said the underlying trend is more encouraging. A deterioration in
the second quarter was due to some large claims and additional reserve
strengthening. The Asia-Pacific business slipped into small losses
because reserves had to be strengthened in Australia.

A tour de force of a cruiser impresses Stewart Fraser.
LEAVING Largs boat haven, we head out at 330 degrees. Engine speed
1000 rpm. No need for trim tabs. The Seawings 277 purrs over a quiet
sea, past some boats with flapping sails.
''Like to open her up a bit?'' says Angus Scott. And with the blessing
of Euroyachts' director, off we go.
This modern sports cruiser, from Hardy Marine, is like chalk and
cheese compared with previous fisherman-style boats.
Moving the throttle forward brings a surge of power. Pushing the trim
tab button eases three tonnes of GRP on to the plane. The tabs are
variable hydraulic, with indicators.
The sterndrive has power trim and tilt, again with indicators. Pushing
a button is as much effort as you need expend on a craft of this style.
The engine registers 3000 rpm, a steady 20.1 knots on the electronic
instrument panel. The Largs ferry is out on port, heading for home. We
simply sweep by, well clear, and no worry for anyone.
Steering is from starboard. Navigation charts are under clear acrylic,
to port. We know where we're going. Past Rothesay Bay, up to the
narrows, on past Tighnabruaich, right round Bute and back to the marina.
An easy afternoon trip.
Angus opened up the unique sunroof before we left, like a T-bar roof
in a sports car. In good weather, you get all the sunshine. Come dark
clouds or rain, you're warm and cosy under a welcome hard-top.
The roofline can be extended right aft, over the cockpit table and
seats: al fresco if you wish, covered if necessary. It makes for an
all-year-round craft.
In fact, it's unashamedly a luxury and comfort cruiser. From wrap
around windscreen, with freshwater screen wash, to cockpit shower line,
hard work is not the issue.
The dinette table in the carpeted main cabin, is served from a galley
with laminated worktop and safety handrails. The stainless steel sink
has mixer tap, three burner gas hob, oven and grill.
Behind a curved wooden door is the toilet, shower and hand basin.
There's lighting, a mirror, a towel holder, even a toothbrush and glass
holder.
There has been some thought to make this a good family boat. Forward,
is space for a large double berth. Unusually, there is a good-size
fore-and-aft single on either side of the companionway.
Each single has dividing curtain, lighting and storage space. Peace
for the parents and privacy for the kids.
Then, preparing to catch up with some sailing boats -- and the
outgoing ferry -- at Colintraive, it's surely time for me to throttle
right back.
''Not necessarily,'' Angus reminds me. ''Look at the wake. And look at
the wash from that displacement boat.''
Sure enough, we're on the plane, displacing a relatively small amount
of sea. The smaller, and slower boat is making waves.
Pass the sailboats, without causing upset, and stop for the ferry. Our
27ft deep-V hull settles down decorously.
Check the surroundings, and we're off. Pause to admire the painted
Maids of Bute to port. Then the 200hp turbo diesel Volvo is asked to get
up and go. If you're in a hurry, top speed is 30 knots.
With contra-rotating propellors, there is increased power and
excellent directional stability. Going backwards, in a straight line, is
a pleasure. Just compare that with some boats you know.
The price of all this luxury living is something in the region of
#75,000. Are people buying? ''Certainly,'' says Angus. ''We've sold
three since February. This is a first-class family boat. You know you
can go where you want, in safety. It is good value for money and it's
great fun, too.''
Around 80% of Euroyachts turnover is in sailing boats, a long-lasting
relationship. With craft as well-turned out as the new Hardy range, it's
easy to see how people can be converted to a motoring life.

WHAT kind of clowning is this? Nobody gets splatted with custard pies
or drooked with water. That's because this clowning (from France) is
closer to life. It's a sly catalogue of everyday frailties, given a
particular feminine spin, by the five white-faced women who lark about
like overgrown girlies, coveting one another's anything -- it doesn't
matter what, only that she's got it -- and being inventively petty in
the process.
Behind the zany plaits, the red noses, the chirrupings, and
mutterings, and odd apparel, lurks an array of all-too-human types,
whose failings are portrayed with hilarious delicacy and a kind of fresh
innocence that is moving as well as charming and funny.
Embarquez-les is obviously French for ''delicious fun''.

TWO solos from the brilliantly fierce and talented Sian Williams,
solos that celebrate resilience, self-knowledge, and a renewed zest for
life.
Circuit Breaker gets another, welcome Fringe showing -- the circus
imagery of Judith Wilkinson's rueful poem of high-flying love is
stunningly captured by Williams's bold use of trapeze. There is
something utterly compelling about the way her tiny frame -- as graceful
and sinuous as a Siamese cat -- conceals such blistering strength.
At times, it's as if some unseen harness was holding her arcing limbs
mid-air. All this, and a spoken delivery of the poem while flying,
poignantly, towards despair in the sawdust.
Coupled with this is Upstart, a cracking display where Christina Hoyos
meets Tina Turner and the result is hot rock flamenco in a slithery,
sexy red rubber mini-skirt. Seriously electric.

ACT Five, Scene Three. The play begins. Romeo and Juliet are about to
die, and in death their love will be made eternal. But in Nada Theatre's
version, the two lovers can't bring themselves to commit that final act
of suicide and, after a hilarious series of failed attempts, choose
instead to go on a fantasy voyage to rediscover their love.
Such a concept could easily end up looking whimsical but, from the
company that brought us Ubu with vegetables, it is deliciously
theatrical. Whether it is the novel and downright quirky inventiveness
of re-enacting the death scene with two bare feet, or the visual poetry
of the sea of bubbles that ends the show, it is a magical production
that more than justifies your expenditure on that French language
refresher course.

AND you thought it was Shakespeare what wrote it. Indeed he did,
though neither in the same order nor with the same disregard to everyone
bar the titular hero. This is a bizarre production that will infuriate
as many people as it inspires. I can't imagine what you'd make of it if
you weren't familiar with the original, story-telling taking second
place to a rigorous, physical showmanship and a cavalier disregard to
making the language understood, even though they make it crystal clear
when they choose to.
Dillon plays Hamlet like he was King Lear's Fool, bellowing one line,
whispering the next, which makes for dazzling speeches but little
variation across the show. If I add that Rosencrantz is played by a
glove-puppet puppy and that the score ranges from Noh-inspired
percussion to Another One Bites the Dust, you'll understand why you can
only go and make up your own mind.

DURING the course of his hypnotic one-man demonstration of life's
propensity to coincidence and happenstance, Ben Keaton requires himself
to become two other people. He begins as a prosaic, poetry-loving booby
who mutates into an accidental tourist-terrorist.
He concludes as a regular bloke with an irregular and awful secret.
Ben also sings, revealing a beguiling voice redolent of David Byrne and
Lyle Lovett. His show is sometimes comic, sometimes chilling. And while
I'm not entirely sure of its philosophical conclusions, I do know that
Ben Keaton is one of the most expressive actors to whom you could

ALONG with many other marvels, Nick Revell has created a keen and
tender elegy for the deathly surrender of his own youthful idealism.
Liberal Psychotic is a wise and subtle monologue about growing up;
becoming more reactionary and cynical; having the honesty to be worried
about one's increasing cynicism, and then becoming even more worried
when you realise that cynical is easier and more profitable.
Liberal Psychotic is confessional and compelling; frank and fiercely
funny, as well as genuinely revelatory. Liberal Psychotic also neatly
Molotovs pomposity, particularly as it relates to politically-flavoured
stand-up comedy of a self-righteous bent. It's insightful, incandescent,
and innately decent . . . just like Nick Revell.

monologue by Dermot Bolger, of Lament for Arthur Cleary fame. He's
certainly not the first to write a one-woman show in which a widow
reflects on a life at the mercy of the whims of a self-absorbed husband.
But what grace, what eloquence, what beautifully controlled command of
story-telling Bolger brings! And, delivered by an unshowy, rooted and
concentrated Mariah Neary, The Holy Ground becomes a work of tremendous
insight, revealing the bitterness, despair and desperation of a loveless
and childless prison of a marriage.
Capturing the tenderness and pride, the frustration and isolation of a
woman lacking the vision, resources or the power to escape her
extinguishing position of subservience, it is a subtly powerful and
absorbing piece of theatre.

HIS new sticky-up hair gives him a distressing resemblance to Nigel
Kennedy, but thankfully Mark Little is a one-off. Mark's robust
amiability and quick-wittedness allow him to wring laughs ostensibly out
of thin air. He does a lot of apparently aimless barging about, thus
disguising the fact that he's actually training his satirist's gunsights
on a host of contemporary hypocrisies: Damien Hirst's alleged art, the
supposed benefits of Prozac, Quentin Capuccino's macho movie-making, as
well as the political apathy of us lot, his well-meaning leftie
audience, and his own undistinguished thespian past in Neighbours. Best
revelation? ''Today's held-in laughter is the tumour of tomorrow.'' Let
it out for Mark Little, no worries.

YOU'VE got to hand it to singer Suzanne Bonnar: despite the unbearable
heat of her venue, the late starting time of her set, and her
unforgivable, near unrecognisable treatments of various familiar songs,
the audience still whooped, cheered, and begged for more.
More of the lesser-known material like the lovely bossa nova-ish
ballad Wave would not have gone amiss. It worked because Bonnar sounded
natural; she managed to make it her own without causing GBH to its
melody as she had done to some of the standards, particularly her
disastrous opener -- Them There Eyes, less of a song and more of an
exercise in racing to get all the lyrics in before the end of each
phrase.

IF you want to save yourself a couple of hundred on a trip to New
York, you could do worse than check out these two one-man
multi-character shows from the Big Apple.
Surprisingly similar in format, Danny Hoch's Some People and Richard
Hoehler's Out Of The Blue take a handful of character-types from the New
York streets and present them in a series of vignettes, the purpose of
which is less to be funny than to celebrate the act of observation and
eavesdropping.
Both shows have their rewards, but it is Hoch who stands out as the
exceptional talent, taking us deep into the multicultural quagmire where
Spanish meets Polish meets English meets Caribbean meets Pigeon in a
furiously fast barrage of often incomprehensible language. It's hip,
contemporary, alive, often bewilderingly funny and -- like Hoehler's
show -- only wanes when the performer's talent starts to look more
substantial than his material.

THE previous show had overrun by tens of minutes. The divine prospect
of eating something other than a sweaty sandwich was vanishing off the
schedule. I was not in the mood to laugh. Grrrrr!
But laugh I did. I couldn't help myself. Nor could the five other folk
scattered round the theatre. They all laughed, out loud, without the
security blanket of neighbouring ho-ho-hos. To get that kind of
uninhibited response argues quality clowning. Rhapsodia is.
This trio from Spain have a sure understanding of the incongruous, the
eccentric and the plain daft. An operatic diva has her feathers ruffled
by a vacuum cleaner. A dolorous folk singer makes a cake of himself when
he bows. Anything that smacks of pomposity -- including Spanish culture!
-- is gently spoofed. This is affable slapstick, strong on visual and
musical gags that easily skit over the language barrier.

WE are in Hell. Hell, you should know, is a place where young women in
body-hugging costumes talk about outrageous sex in the kind of arched
tones usually heard declaiming, ''A-h-and-bag . . .''
The young women are Devils. God and religion are their con tricks on
humanity. We are, by now, most definitely in Hell. We are in that Hades
where bad plays squint and leer and torment their victims. Oh, the agony
as the cast pontificate at ponderous length on their wicked, lascivious
ways. Oh, the pain of watching a girl with clingfilm for a bra writhe in
a sham of sexual depravity. She is Beelzebub, Sex fiend. She is also the
choreographer. She has the same surname as the scriptwriter. Oh, Hell.
Avernal is self-indulgent posturing with a superiority complex. The
damnable thing is -- the company don't seem to know or care. Avoid.

THIS is the kind of play that people like to say the Fringe is all
about. Off-beat, imaginative, rough-round-the-edges, barely half-an-hour
long, and performed by an up-for-anything young transatlantic company.
It tells a Hamlet-like story of a son's attempted revenge on his uncle
for the murder of his father, a revenge made all the more pressing after
the uncle gives the young man's mother a toe-job at the funeral.
So far so straight-forward, but the Atlantic Crossing Theatre Project
turns it into an odd piece of stylised expressionism complete with
circus ringleader, murderous postal workers, and a stream of apparently
real newspaper reports. It's too brief to add up to much, but it's done
in the best of spirits.

YOU know the score. Inter-war girls' public school. Institutionalised
racism, snobbery, and patriarchal British Empire values. A dash of
nascent homosexuality, teenage crushes and midnight feasts. And a load
of gags based on archaic turns of phrase and class-conscious tuck-box
language.
What makes Joe Richards's play such a joy, back in this National
Student Theatre Company production after pulling in the punters on last
year's Fringe, is the brisk and breathless performances, the constantly
inventive direction, and the delightful a cappella arrangements of Nick
Brace's songs.
It's wizard fun and -- just to salve your conscience after so much
inconsequential frippery -- there's even a last-minute moral twist that
powerfully, though rather casually, implicates the British ruling class
in the Holocaust.

LAST year, in Pub Internationale, Harry and two assistants explored
the lure of the boozy singalong. Now he's back on his ownsome: Harry
Hill, the one and only king of the recurring non-sequitur! Prince of the
slightly-misheard top-pop hit-single lyric! Absurdist son of Mister
Magoo and Harry Worth! Bloke with a vast shirt-collar and an impressive
repertoire of non-verbal interjections and peculiar hand-gestures!
Harry's new show is called Savlon 2000. It establishes conclusive
links between Mother Teresa, Pulp, Blur, Oasis, Echobelly, Jimmy Savile,
and the aforementioned household antiseptic cream, Savlon. How? By means
beyond rational explanation. Just take my word for it that ''Harry
Hill'' is short for ''Harry Hilarious''.

ONE hundred pink pastel circles form a line around all the gallery
rooms, each sheet neatly pinned by its top corner. Every one is a
different shade or tone from peach to flesh, shocking to salmon, rose to
raspberry, coral to cerise and pearl. It's as though a make-up mad
teenager has made a blob with each of her lipsticks. Indeed, the
overwhelming effect here is of conceptual cosmetics rather than art.
The title, Trying to Remember the Colour of Jackie Kennedy's Pillbox
Hat, is, according to the catalogue, exactly what this American is
doing. Memory is paramount but often seen through a haze, a glass
darkly. It's as if the pink is on the tip of his tongue.
Previous projects include paintings of the Vienna ceiling above
Freud's couch and pictures of his studio walls at night. Till Sept 2nd.
Meanwhile the Collective has launced 50,000 copied of its new
bi-monthly gallery guide to Glasgow and Edinburgh. Excellent.

392 years dead, two mannequin queens rise from the grave to do battle
for posthumus supremacy. Elizabeth and Mary (not the Scots one) Tudor,
alias Jill Dowse and Kate Joseph, though slightly sidetracked by
sisterly bickering, take advantage of historical hindsight for their mad
dash through their respective lives.
Tones of the twentieth-century Lady T add freshness to some slightly
cliched business, and on the whole the blend of fluorescent lycra with
ancient petticoats works well.
With Punch and the policeman firmly boxed up, Judy finally gets her

In a bumper season for the Scots tourist industry, Kirsty Scott
explains plans to maintain its optimistic momentum.
IT WAS Wednesday last week that tourism officials in Fort William
experienced something they had not seen since the heady days of the
mid-1980s -- they ran out of accommodation.
A hasty radio appeal brought in enough new beds for the visitors, but
for the officials the glitch was a welcome one. ''It's not the first
time it's happened,'' said Fort William and Lochaber Tourism visitor
services manager, Winnie Dick. ''It happened quite frequently in the
eighties, in the boom years. At that time people had to sleep in their
cars and in their bus shelters. But that had not happened for a good few
years.''
After one of the bleakest years for the tourism industry, early
indications are that the 1995 trade is picking up in some areas of the
country, and while the weather has undoubtedly helped, officials hope it
is not just a reaction to the heatwave, but a real sign of underlying
improvement.
''The sun has helped, but that's not the main factor,'' said Dick.
''Lots of people book in advance. They come to see Scotland. If the sun
is here when they come then that's great.''
In Fort William's case, they believe that a mix of innovative
marketing techniques, a strong push for business at a conference in the
Hague, and the interest piqued by the Hollywood blockbusters Rob Roy and
Braveheart have helped boost the figures so far this season. They've
already counted 28,000 visitors to the town's Cameron Centre last week,
compared to 23,208 last year.
''Basically it's down to good marketing and just perhaps a change in
the fortunes of Britain,'' said Dick. ''The recession is diminishing a
bit and maybe people have a bit more money to spend on holidays. I'd
like to think so.''
Down in the Glasgow area, they've seen a similar upswing but they are
equally keen to play down the effect of the weather.
Greater Glasgow Tourist Board has seen bookings rise by 14% and 15% in
June and July this year compared to last year, with inquiries to the
tourist information centres rising by 4% and 9% respectively over the
same period.
''I think the key thing is that many people will have booked in
advance and the weather is what they get when they get here,'' said GGTB
spokesman Ken Walton. ''There is no doubt that it has to have an effect
on the way people are moving within the area, but I think there are much
more longer-term issues and much more basic issues at work here in terms
of how people are taking breaks.''
Walton said a six-month marketing campaign, extolling the virtues of
the short-break was paying dividends. ''The responses we have been
getting are extremely encouraging and I think it's that kind of focused
activity that's possibly helping to improve things to a great degree.''
Over in Edinburgh, they don't have exact figures yet but all
indications are that with the Tall Ships, the Festival and the Phantom
of the Opera coming in October, it will be a healthy season. They have
already had a problem with accommodation and expect similar No Vacancy
signs to go up in September as well.
''Business has definitely improved on last year and has been good
since the Tall Ships,'' said tourism spokesman Gordon McCulloch. ''In
Edinburgh the percentages have gone up every year and it looks like they
are going to go up again this year.''
Again, McCulloch was reluctant to give the heatwave too much credit.
''I think it's a drip, drip effect on so many fronts. We've done a lot
of press trips and word of mouth is going out about how good it is and
not just Edinburgh, it's Scotland as a whole. It's not something that
you can always put your finger on but you just hope you are doing
something right.''
In Dundee, however, tourism officials say bookings are down on last
year but there appears to be an increase in the number of visitors to
the town.
The Scottish Tourist Board, meanwhile, launched a new publicity
offensive yesterday to extend the tourist season and will release
figures for the first six months of this year later in the month.
Spokesman Graham Birse said that the first three months of 1995 were
looking healthy for Scotland as a whole, although some areas, including
the Highlands had not performed so well.
They were encouraged by the signals, but warned against predictions of
a bumper year. ''1994 was a pretty bad year and consequently we would
want to see an improvement on 1994 whatever the weather,'' he said. ''We
would like to see it coming off the bottom as it were.
''There is no doubt that the arrangements put into place last year
have taken effect this year in terms of more resources being made
available from the Scottish Office for marketing, and the launch of
special niche marketing programmes.
''What we want to try and get away from, however, is the boom and bust
and peaks and troughs. What we are really looking for is consistent
long-term growth; for '95 to be better than '94 and for '96 to be better
than '95.''
However, niche marketing and focused campaigns notwithstanding, the
STB is still willing to give credit where credit is due.
''We have to be quite frank,'' said Birse.''The weather is a boost.
It's a shot in the arm for a season which had already begun to look
good.''

Nicholas Budgen believes individual agendas are behind the Labour
Party's bickering.
MAKE no mistake there is a crisis in the Labour Party. I know this
because I can recognise the similarities between my party and the Labour
Party, and I can see how misunderstandings arise.
It starts from the beginning. Because we have an unwritten
constitution, it is easy to misjudge where power at any one time lies.
The newspapers assume that the leader of a party is all powerful. When
first an idea or a policy is put forward, it has to be done with energy
and self-confidence.
The leader also has the assistance of a body of spin-doctors and
advisers who suggest the way in which the subject may be commented upon.
Only the more sceptical of scribes will wonder what opposition will come
from the leader's own party.
The old election meeting, in which you questioned your personal
candidate, is dead. Now the local candidate is often seen as no more
than a potential minor employee of the party leader. ''Don't worry
Budgen. We're voting for Major on Thursday.''
Well it's all coming apart for Mr Blair. I'm not saying that we, the
Tories, will win. That is, as yet, uncertain.
Recently Blair has been taught two lessons about politics which no
leader should forget. You cannot treat Parliament and your ordinary
party workers with contempt and get away with it forever.
Let us remember that a Government is responsible to Parliament and not
for Parliament. The Labour Party has an understandable hunger for power.
Every party has its mixture of characters. There are the careerists.
There are the subservient party men. There are the administrators. Such
men would be No 2 in the Ministry of Drains for any government at any
time. There's not much difference between a cautious conventional Tory
Attorney General and an equally cautious and conventional Labour
Attorney General.
So there have always been plenty of sound men of business in every
party. In recent years the Tory Party has been taken over by the career
politicians. The career politician does not resign, if at all, until at
or near the ceiling of promotion. The career politician sees politics as
terms of office and not in terms of ideas.
It is now plain that Blair is a Tory not only in his ideas, but also
in his attitudes. He aspires to be a career politician and is prepared
to support any views that lead him towards office.
What is now emerging is that some people in the Labour Parliamentary
Party want power but power for its own sake. They want the salary and
the Rover all right, but they want them in order to support, as they
would put it, the needs of the disadvantaged and the dispossessed.
The Labour Parliamentary Party are beginning to show that they are
more interested in ideas than in gaining power. This means trouble for
the future.
So as we move towards the General Election I suggest that it would be
as well to look at the views of individual candidates as well as the
party leaders. There are Parliamentary problems ahead for Blair. Of
course there will be sticks and carrots to manage the Labour Party. Some
councillors will be bought off with a job on a quango. Others will be
frightened by the threat of being suspended from the Labour Party.
But never forget politics is, most of all, a voluntary activity for
people who feel strongly about how their country should be governed.
The core of the Labour Party is the people who trudge round the
streets knocking on doors and collecting small subscriptions without the
hope of reward or patronage.
The genuine voluntary worker in the Labour Party remains committed to
the interests of the poor and the working-class and he believes in
improvememt through state expenditure of other people's money.
The Labour Party will, in former Dagenham MP Bryan Gould's words, only
be united in a shared ideology and vision. So I say talk to the Labour
man in your street in Glasgow. He is more likely to tell you what a
Labour Government will be like than will that nice Mr Blair.
* Nicholas Budgen is Conservative MP for Wolverhampton South West.

Allan Laing meets the director of an acutely observed new film which
portrays the cynicism of the FBI's clandestine attempts to neutralise
the Black Panther movement of the sixties.
ACONTROVERSIAL new film by black actor and director Mario Van Peebles
claims that J. Edgar Hoover enlisted the help of the Mafia to flood
America's black ghettos with heroin in the late 1960s.
The paranoid and racist FBI director, fearing that the activities of
the Black Panther movement could actually spark off a revolution,
believed that the availability of drugs would serve to pacify a
troublesome Afro-American population.
Because of his unwillingness to compromise his polemical storyline,
Van Peebles was shunned by the Hollywood studio establishment. The men
with the fat cigars and pink faces, though initially keen on the idea,
insisted that he introduce a major role for a white actor, ''like Tom
Cruise or Brad Pitt''. He refused.
After nine years of attempting in vain to raise US finance for the
project Van Peebles, who is one of the most successful of Hollywood's
new breed of black directors with movies like Free Jack City and Posse
to his credit, had to turn to Europe for his budget. The money was
eventually provided by the UK-based Working Title and the European
entertainment conglomerate Polygram.
The result is Panther, at once a taut political thriller and a
powerful film about the evolution of the Black Panther movement and its
effects upon the American nation. It was shown this week at the Drambuie
Edinburgh Film Festival and will go on general release later this year.
The movie was directed by Van Peebles and written and co-produced by
his father, Melvin, a distinguished film-maker in his own right and the
man who is recognised as the godfather of black cinema in America.
The Black Panther Party for Self Defence was formed in Oakland,
California, in 1966 by two angry young men, Bobby Seale and Huey Newton,
as a response to the harassment and violence suffered by the black
community at the hands of the local police. Under its black power
banner, it grew to become a potent force for the advancement of civil
rights. Armed and fully prepared to counter violence with violence, its
members were a darker, more sinister, counterpoint to Martin Luther
King's peace movement.
If there is one abiding pictorial memory of the Panthers then it is
American athletes Tommie Smith and John Carlos delivering, live on
television across the world, the clenched-fist black power salute after
winning medals in the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City. The white
establishment feared and loathed the Panthers' radical policies and
their perceived revolutionary stance. Almost 30 years later, the
movement is still regarded by many Americans as a force which threatened
to destroy the very fabric of the white-dominated society.
Panther, arguably the most significant black movie in many years, has
been criticised in America for being historically inaccurate. It is
unapologetically one-sided, certainly. The entire Oakland police force
is branded as brutal and racist. Indeed, almost every white character in
the film is portrayed as brutal and racist. It stars black actors Kadeem
Hardison and Bokeem Woodbine and also features Joe Don Baker, Richard
Dysart, M. Emmet Walsh, Robert Culp, and Dick Gregory.
Van Peebles, in Edinburgh with his father to publicise the film, said:
''When people are medicated, they don't cause trouble. The FBI realised
that. Hoover didn't really employ the Mafia, he just instructed the
local police authorities to leave them alone; don't police certain
areas. Of course, he categorically denied the existence of the Mafia
because they were blackmailing him over his homosexuality.''
For Van Peebles there are two kinds of history. There is popular
history and then there's unpopular history. ''Popular history tends to
be those kinds of things which make us feel a little better. Take
Schindler's List; the Nazis did some terrible things and it makes us
feel warm and tickly when we see this good guy helping Jews.
''But we don't see films about the way refugee Jews, fleeing from
Germany, were turned away from America -- and they were -- because that
wouldn't make us feel all warm and tickly. The history books are always
written by the winners. That's why the heavyweight champion of the world
might be Ali or Tyson but Hollywood makes him look like Rocky.
''And that's why they asked me to find a role for Tom Cruise or Brad
Pitt as a nice white student who helps the Panthers. That sounds like a
weird idea but, when you think about it, it's no weirder than getting
Kevin Costner to come along and help the native Americans in Dances With
Wolves. Again, this nice white guy makes us feel all warm and tickly,''
he explained.
Van Peebles was clearly grateful for the finance provided by Europe
but he added: ''The thing is that, when you're in Europe you can stand
back and look at someone else's dirty shirts.''
Melvin Van Peebles, who based his screenplay on his novel of the same
name, claims that Hoover's plan backfired on him and, indirectly, it may
have led to America's current drugs problems.
''The drugs were supposed to be contained in these problem areas but,
thanks to their own racial prejudices, they overlooked the fact that
black culture is the one which is most emulated throughout the world. So
the drug problem overflowed and the Mafia eventually lost control of
it,'' he said.

lungs. The findings could lead to ways of identifying people at risk for
lung cancer and perhaps to preventive therapies. Dr Yosuke Kishimoso and

''Since the kidnapping our embassy in Bogota have maintained close

''We condemn the killing of a British citizen and express revulsion at

Washington
THE Air Force announced today it has grounded two fighter pilots and
three radar plane officers and rebuked two generals involved in the
accidental 1994 shooting-down of two US helicopters which killed 26
people in Iraq.
General Ronald Fogleman, Air Force chief of staff, said that besides
the groundings of the junior officers, he has also given them and the
two generals in charge of the operation performance-failure letters.
Other defence officials said those letters will likely end their
careers.
The episode in which 16 Americans and 11 officials from allied
countries lost their lives, took place over northern Iraq on April 14,
1995.
The two F-15 pilots patrolling a no-fly zone set up to protect Iraqi
Kurds after the 1991 Gulf War misidentified a pair of US Blackhawk
helicopters as Iraqi craft and shot them down, killing all on board.
The other officers punished were aboard a radar control plane running
air operations. They failed to detect the mistake and warn the attackers
away from their target.
''Lives were lost,'' Fogleman said in a videotaped message to all Air
Force members. ''Our people did not meet Air Force standards. Now we are
holding all involved accountable.''
Defence Secretary William Perry called an Air Force report on the
actions the first response to an order for a review of shootdown
punishments.
He said he and Deputy Defence Secretary John White are waiting for
reports from the Army and Joint Chiefs of Staff and will ''decide if
additional measures are necessary''.
The new Air Force punishments follow criticism from relatives of those
killed and members of Congress who felt that the Air Force let those
involved get away with what had amounted to wrist-slaps.
Bitter relatives had urged Congress to investigate why only one
officer was court-martialled.Captain James Wang, was acquitted in June.
Wang, a crew chief on the Airborne Warning and Control Systems command
plane, accused the Air Force of making him a scapegoat rather than
taking action to prevent such accidents from recurring.
Wang was among the officers whose grounding was announced today.The
others were radar-plane officers Joseph Halcli and Ricky Wilson, fighter
pilots Lieutenant Colonel Randy May and Captain Eric Wickson.
Senior officers receiving rebukes are Brigadier Generals Jeffrey
Pilkington and Curtis Emery.--Reuter

<RECORDNO>976863307</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE fate of two British hostages, held in India by extremist
guerrillas who have already beheaded a fellow captive, remained
uncertain last night as a deadline threatening their execution expired.
Indian authorities were still refusing to free 15 jailed comrades of
the Al-Faran Kashmiri separatists who are holding Britons Paul Wells and
Keith Mangan, an American and a German.
A fifth hostage, Norwegian Hans Ostroe, was found decapitated two days
ago, with a note from the guerillas threatening to execute the other
captives unless their demands were met by today.
The Indian Government has considered mounting a rescue raid but warned
it would put the hostages' lives at risk.
Mr Tim Devlin spoke for Keith Mangan's parents Charles and Mavis
Mangan when he said that the family supported any moves by Indian
authorities to release the hostages by force.
''We had a long conversation about it and the view they take now is
that they would rather something was done, even though they know it is
enormously risky,'' said Mr Devlin.
He said they were shocked and horrified at Mr Ostroe's barbaric
murder.
''Up until this gruesome discovery, they had rather hoped that this
was a benign group seeking publicity,'' said Stockton South Tory MP Mr
Devlin.
''But they are coping remarkably well considering. They are hoping
that something will turn up and they are trying to keep their spirits
up.''
The father of Paul Wells also spoke of the agonising wait for news.
''We are coping as well as we can, basically. I just want those four
chaps out of there quickly and as safely as possible,'' said Bob Wells,
50, who works for Debenhams.
He told the Lancashire Evening Telegraph it was time for a rescue
operation.
''You can't really sit back. I think it's getting so dangerous up
there now.''
He said his son was a ''stable chap''.
''He used to have quite a temper when he was a young teenager, but he
is now quite a calm character.
''I think he can ride things out quite easily and adapt to situations
quite quickly.
''But my fear is that, if he knows what happened to Hans Ostroe . . .
I shudder to think what he's thinking about.''
Meanwhile, Kashmiris expressed their outrage at the execution by
planning a strike for tomorrow, claiming the killing ''violates the
Kashmiri spirit''.
Mr Mangan, 34, an electrical contractor from Middlesbrough, Cleveland,
and Mr Wells, 23, a photography student from Blackburn, Lancashire, were
abducted at gunpoint six weeks ago from their camp 60 miles east of the
Kashmiri capital Srinagar.
The kidnappers claim Mr Mangan is in a critical condition after a gun
battle with soldiers, although the Indian authorities deny it took place
and suggest a photo of him in bloody bandages may be a hoax.
Indian officials said they had the support of the three Western
nations whose citizens were being held captive in remaining firmly
opposed to any deal with the militants.
''The diplomats have agreed with our strategy of negotiating rather
than releasing any militants,'' a spokesman said.

The threat that the seven-month-long trial could collapse came after

Ito's wife.
''Just when you thought things couldn't get any crazier,'' Ito said,

interest.
Prosecutor Marcia Clark told Ito on Monday she might call his wife to
testify and Ito replied today if that happened, he would have to

St George
BERMUDA'S referendum on independence from Britain, planned for today,
was postponed as Hurricane Felix lashed the islands with high winds and
rain.
The international airport was shut and no government offices opened.
The referendum is to take place tomorrow.
Cabinet Secretary Leo Mills announced the delay in the vote in a radio
broadcast. He said it was ''considered unwise to expose voters to danger
from the weather''.
The islands were pounded by heavy rains and 100mph gusts that sent
huge waves crashing into beaches. No deaths or injuries were reported
but two-thirds of Bermuda's homes were left without power and the
second-largest town, St George, was cut off for hours by damage to the
1000-yard causeway connecting it to the mainland.
The independence referendum will be the first in the history of
Bermuda, Britain's oldest colony. The chain of 138 islands and islets
came under the British crown in 1684 and achieved internal
self-government in 1968.
Thousands of residents and tourists were ordered to evacuate two North
Carolina islands today as the hurricane headed towards the US mainland.
Pounding surf thundered along the East Coast as far north as Cape Cod
and Maine. Three people had died in the surf since the weekend.
The unusually wide storm was moving toward the west-northwest at about
14mph. It was feared that it could hit the Outer Banks, a chain of
coastal islands, around sunrise tomorrow, with the eye making landfall
around sundown, said Steve Harned of the National Weather Service in
Raleigh.
The hurricane warning area extended from South Carolina to northern
Virginia. A hurricane watch -- a less severe form of advisory than a
warning -- was in effect for coastal areas of South Carolina, Maryland,
and Delaware on either side of the warning area.
The storm was packing wind blowing at a steady 80mph and
hurricane-force wind extended up to 140 miles out from the centre, the
National Weather Service said. Tropical storm-force wind extended up to
290 miles out.
Residents and visitors on North Carolina's coastal Ocracoke and
Hatteras islands, part of the Outer Banks chain, were ordered to
evacuate this morning. As early as yesterday, water had washed over
Hatteras' main highway at Rodanthe at high tide.--Reuter
''By law, we cannot physically force anyone to leave,'' Dare County
spokesman Charlie Hartig said. ''We hope the word 'mandatory' connotes a
certain severity to what we're talking about.''
In Virginia, navy warships from submarines to aircraft carriers began
streaming out of the Norfolk Naval Base in Virginia to ride out the
hurricane at sea and avoid being battered into piers and each other.

<HEADLINE>Tests confirmed listeria in cheese, court told</HEADLINE>

<PAGE>7</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>976863310</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE court battle over the gourmet Lanark Blue cheese yesterday heard
evidence from a biologist who carried out tests on batches suspected of
being contaminated with listeria.
A food hygiene expert from the Scottish Agricultural College in
Ayrshire gave detailed evidence of the nature of the tests involved,
which highlighted a high level of listeria in some batches of the
cheese.
Clydesdale District Council is bidding to have 44 batches of producer
Humphrey Errington's cheese, worth #27,000, destroyed and dumped in a
landfill site.
Several separate tests were carried out on 50 batches of the cheese in
February at the SAC lab, the court heard.
The results and test procedures were made available to a food expert
who was representing Mr Errington.
Mr Stephen Crawford, 38, a specialist in microbiology at the college,
said: ''We did not need to divulge our methods.
''But we decided it was in everybody's interests to show the results
to a representative of Mr Errington.''
Mr Crawford said Mr Errington's expert representative agreed with the
results of the tests which showed the presence of, in some cases, high
levels of listeria monocytogenes.
The tests were carried out after samples from all batches of the
cheese were individually bagged, sealed, and numbered to prevent
cross-contamination.
Clinical tests revealed the listeria, results which were later
confirmed by carrying out controlled checks.
Further tests were done in less clinical conditions -- the listeria
was not isolated and had to compete with other organisms for growth on
plates.
Mr Crawford said a blue-grey sheen developed, indicating the presence
of listeria.
He told Clydesdale's QC, Mr Neil Brailsford, that an extra test had
been carried out, introducing the organism into horse blood.
''The organism has the ability to break down blood,'' Mr Crawford
said. ''The bacterial colony will grow while the blood there will break
down and form a clear area.''
Mr Brailsford: ''The bacteria has destroyed the blood cells, in crude
terms?''
Mr Crawford: ''Yes.'' He added that, in his opinion, 37 samples showed
listeria, 14 of which were of a ''pure type''.
On the validity of the results of the 14 samples, Mr Crawford said:
''If I was a betting man, I would put a year's wages on it.''
Of the other ''suspect batches'' he said: ''I would put an each-way
bet on it.''
Mr Errington, 50, who produces the cheese in Dunsyre, Lanarkshire,
claims the type of listeria found is not harmful.
The batches of cheese tested are still in cold storage at his Dunsyre
factory farm.
The hearing, before Sheriff John Douglas Allan, continues.

HICKSON International is still bearing the scars of the recent
detergent war and the company said yesterday it has decided to cut the
half-time dividend from 2.85p to 2p a share. This follows the reduction
in the previous year's final payment in March by 3p to 2.15p as the
first blow from the loss of a Unilever contract was felt.
The company made a manganese catalyst used in Persil Power which was
hard hit in the public relations war waged by arch rival Procter &amp;
Gamble. The contract was worth more than #8m a year in profit.
In the first six months, Hickson, whose chairman is James Hann,
formerly of Scottish Nuclear, saw pre-tax profits plunge by #6m to #6.1m
on overall turnover little changed at #207m. But fine chemical sales
were well down, not only because of the Unilever contract but also
because of a major fire in 1993 which has still to be made good.
Detergent manufacturers have also been slower than expected to
introduce their high-power compact detergents which need Hickson's
unique technology.
Timber protection saw a sales gain but the combination of higher raw
material prices and a sluggish US construction industry saw divisional
profits fall back.
Mr Hann is encouraging shareholders by saying he anticipates a
stronger second-half performance. The shares responded by easing 3p to
115p.

HANSON'S share price was little changed at 216p as the conglomerate,
which just over two weeks ago made an agreed #2500m cash bid for REC
Eastern Group, sailed in with third-quarter operating profits well
within market projections.
At the pre-tax level, they fell 11% to #264m, lower than expected
because exceptional charges of #72m in the quarter for the USI demerger
were higher than anticipated by analysts.
But, after stripping out exceptionals, they emerge at around #336m, up
from #297m, which compares with a market range of between #290m and as
high as #350m. Ahead of exceptionals and interest, operating profits
rose by 22% from #306m to #372m. Overall operating profits for the nine
months are up from #659m to #1034m. The quarterly dividend is unchanged
at 3p.
Chairman Lord Hanson immediately struck a positive note on the bid for
Eastern, the benefits of which some analysts regard as questionable on
the grounds that the company is paying too much, growth prospects are
modest, and cash flow benefits appear minimal. Added to this, of course,
there are also political and regulatory risks to the income.
However, Lord Hanson said it would bring in a new major business,
adding: ''We expect this to be earnings enhancing immediately with
considerable potential for growth outside its regulated electricity
distribution.''
The company also indicated it would go ahead with the bid even if
there was a monopolies referral for the whole of the electricity sector,
though clearly it feels there are no competition grounds for an Eastern
referral.
So far as Hanson's profits are concerned, the group's core operations
spanning chemicals, minerals, and tobacco were ''performing in line with
expectations''.
The figures were spearheaded by the group's Quantum Chemical Unit
which rose well ahead of the previous year. Most of the other businesses
also contributed useful growth with SCM Chemicals, tobacco, aggregates,
material handling, and coal all up. On the downwside, as indicated at
the half-year, propane and forest products showed falls, the former due
to mild winter weather and the latter because of lower lumber prices.
Corporate development director Chris Collins said that earlier in the
year Hanson was comparing recovery with recession but now it was
comparing recovery with recovery.
However, at their present level, the shares are only a few pence above
their low for the year and, indeed, their 1995 high stands only at 253p.
Hanson may have its appeal as an income stock on a yield of 7%, but it
has clearly been under-performing for some time. And there seems to be
little market enthusiasm for it now.
The proposed takeover of Eastern Group has certainly not lit up the
market with enthusiasm, and yesterday's nine-month figures clearly did
not inspire much enthusiasm with analysts still generally downbeat about
the likely progress of the shares in the short term.

THERE is increasing speculation that a diamond price war could break
out between De Beers and Russia in a market over-supplied with small
uncut stones.
If a conflict does break out, it is not expected to bring down the
price of a ring because the retail mark-up is so substantial.
Last month, De Beers reduced the price paid by its Central Selling
Organisation subsidiary by up to 15% for small diamonds. But it also
increased those on larger stones by a small amount.
The problem is that while Russia has contracted to supply 26% of all
CSO purchases amounting to about $1100m annually, it is selling a
similar amount outside the CSO which traditionally has run the industry
though the world's best organised international cartel, accounting until
very recently for about 85% of all primary diamond production.
Uncertainty as to whether the Russians will renew their five-year
marketing contract at the year end has depressed prices.
A meeting has been scheduled between De Beers chairman Julian
Ogilvie-Thompson and the Russians for next month. That could well be a
tense affair as the Russians are reportedly angry about De Beer's
price-cutting while believing that the original terms were too
favourable to the purchaser.
That is a totally new phenomenon in the industry as De Beers' policy
has always been to support rough diamond prices in difficult times.
The increase in prices for better quality stones will benefit
primarily De Beers own production in South Africa and its associates in
Botswana and Namibia which produce a higher proportion of these
categories than all other mines.
In the first six months, De Beers raised pre-tax profits by 11% to
$497m (#318m) on sales 2% down at $2540m. Profits were helped by De
Beers own production which is higher margin being supplied to meet a
shortfall from other producers although that position is expected to
reverse in the current six months.
The interim dividend has been held at 25.6c (16.4p). De Beers shares
firmed 18p to 1606p.

JUST a week after Alpha Airports announced the $122m (#75.8m) proposed
acquisition of the DynAir airport services company in the US, it had to
reveal yesterday that British Airways will not be renewing its flight
services contract with Alpha at New York's JFK Airport.
The contract, which expires on September 30, was worth around #7.5m
annually, compared with total flight services sales for the group of
#220m. As a result of the BA decision, Alpha now fears its US operations
will not be profitable this financial year.
JFK has consistently been a problem for Alpha with the operations
there having lost #400,000 in the past financial year, partly because
the kitchens were too small. In April, chief executive Paul Harrison
said the problems had been resolved.
There is some consolation in that it has been recently awarded
contracts at JFK with KLM and VASP. And it continues to service BA at
all UK airports except Heathrow.
The DynAir acquisition, which is being partially funded through a
placing and open offer on the basis of one new share at 126p for every
nine held, will give Alpha experience of services such as baggage
handling and loading, de-icing and re-fuelling.
Longer term, while DynAir is largely Americas based, it will be able
to tender for European airport work once de-regulation takes effect.
The move will be earnings enhancing immediately and make a substantial
contribution in 1996, boosting income per share by perhaps 10%.
The shares reacted to the BA news by falling 7p to 142p.

STERLING has posted its highest level against the German mark since
early March after rising sharply yesterday on the back of a rampaging
dollar.
Wave after wave of intervention by the US Federal Reserve, operating
on both sides of the Atlantic, the Bundesbank, the Bank of Japan, and
the Swiss National Bank drove the dollar sharply higher against the
German mark and the Japanese yen.
Earlier, the dollar had been boosted in Far Eastern trading by
official figures showing an unexpectedly large fall in Japan's
customs-cleared trade surplus in July.
The Bundesbank's willingness to sell marks and buys dollars was the
crucial factor in boosting market confidence. It was the first time that
the US, German, and Japanese central banks had engaged in concerted
intervention in support of the dollar since May 31.
The difference was that this time the central banks were trying to
push the dollar in the same direction as the market was taking it,
whereas in May they were attempting to buck the trend.
The pound joined in the fun and gained 3.76 pfennigs to DM 2.2952, its
highest closing level since March 3, while losing 1.79 cents to $1.5556.
Sterling has staged a significant recovery since it hit an all-time
low in May just after the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke,
and the Governor of the Bank of England, Eddie George, first fell out
over interest rates.
But its international value as measured by its trade weighted index,
which rose yesterday from 84.4 to 85.0, is still 4% below its level at
the end of last year. On May 9, the day after the bank holiday weekend,
sterling plumbed the depths with the index closing at 82.7. At that
point, the pound had lost 6.6% of its international value in a little
over four months.
Last night, James Capel's Adam Cole said: ''We are not far from the
point when the Bank of England would say we had reversed most of its
fall and a rise in rates would not be needed.''
The pound's fall from grace earlier in the year has been the major
factor behind repeated Bank of England calls for higher rates. The Old
Lady of Threadneedle Street was also concerned about the pace of
economic activity, but this has subsided to a near sustainable rate.
The inflationary implications of a weak pound were evident in Monday's
producer price figures for July, which showed core factory gate price
inflation at 5%, its highest level since May 1991.
However, a further recovery in the pound, which would diminish
inflationary fears, is dependent on the dollar continuing to make
headway on hard currencies such as the mark, the yen, and the Swiss
franc.
Currency dealers were taken aback yesterday by the extent of the
dollar's gains of about three yen and four pfennigs. It ended European
trading at DM1.4730 and 96.75 yen with many Continental centres closed
for the Assumption Day holiday.
Bulls of the dollar, which has been recovering steadily since the
Japanese government announced a package of measures to encourage
institutional investors to invest abroad, are speculating that it will
quickly advance to DM1.50 and 100 yen.
The catalyst for yesterday's drama on the foreign exchange markets was
a drop in Japan's politically sensitive trade surplus to $9430m in July
from $12.25bn in the same month a year ago. The surplus with the US
shrank to $3870m from $5620m a year earlier.
The figures showed that the strength of the yen was eating into
Japan's exports, especially to the US, and the trend is expected to
continue.
Japan's trade figures are posted in dollars but, if the figures are
translated into yen, it has been evident that the surplus has been in
decline for some time. The recovery in the dollar will accentuate this
trend.

MY head's a mess. Not metaphorically I hasten to add. No sirree, none
of that gestalt-therapy, narcissistic, self-obsessive, navel-gazing,
namby-pamby wanky Yankee nonsense for me. I'm just a straightforward
Scot with the usual hangs-ups, ones I'm quite content to leave well
alone -- ye gods, who knows what demons could be unleashed otherwise.
No, when I say my head's a mess I mean it quite literally; I suspect
my roots are showing. Okay, not exactly a heart-stopping,
hold-the-front-page-guys kind of crisis, but certainly a predicament
which plunges me into a regular philosophical dilemma; when my grey
matter wrestles with the grey matter I am forced to face up to the
hideous monster of my personal vanity and, worse, oh, much worse,
confront a stiffled terror of mortality.
The merest glimpse of grey sparks off a chain of association and a
nightmare parade of images which ultimately conclude in a worm-ridden
casket. Like I said, the usual hang-ups.
Best to keep thoughts of imminent decay at bay by attempting to dam
the sea of silver. Sure I think grey hair is like, really dignified. In
fact it can be cool.
It's just that it doesn't quite fit in with my image, viz desperately
clinging on to any semblance of youth. Each time I ponder whether to dye
or not to dye I decide that it's time to grow old gracefully. Then I
panic and take the cowardly Clairol way out.
There's no shame in it. Anyone who uses as much slap as I do is not
going to get her Janet Reger's in a twist over admitting to interfering
with what God intended. However, while it's deemed perfectly acceptable
for women to hit the bottle, men tend to be more coy about colourants.
Thus, a whole culture has evolved around conferring cool on the
grey-haired man, invariably referred to as ''distinguished.'' And women,
charitably, find him sexy. Men who succumb to the salt-and-pepper peril
have the examples of the greying Richard Gere, Jack Nicholson, and erm,
Philip Schofield.
Few men feel pressurised into covering up the grey -- although I
suspect that this is because they're usually pathetically grateful that
they have any locks left The spectre of being a slaphead is far scarier.
But I also reckon it's because men, who have only just mastered the
art of moisturising, would be defeated by the step-by-step procedures of
the home colourant kit, simple though they are. It all looks too
suspiciously fiddly and girlie for them. They haven't evolved
sufficiently to overcome successfully the first obstacle -- putting on
the little plastic gloves.
You doubt me? Have you ever seen a hospital drama where a doctor put
on his own surgical gloves without nurse's help? Have you ever seen a
chap popping on a pair of Marigolds? The only kind of gloves men can
cope with is big green gardening ones, butch suede or leather ones, or
silly driving ones. The only thing that could get them wriggling into
tight plastic gloves would be the prospect of kinky sex.
Men's placid acceptance of grey hair is a nightmare for hair-colour
manufacturers, forced to come up with ever more inventive ways to give
guys a complex. A hysterically funny, although unintentionally so,
advert is currently cheering up my sma' hours televisual viewing,
promoting the miracle properties of a hair dye, Just For Men, targeted
at blokes (sic). Dusting down the archaic before-and-after marketing
ploy, the cheesy campaign justifies Just For Men's efficacy on the basis
that in surveys eight out of 10 wives preferred the after version.
I searched high and low for this new product in Boots. It wasn't in
the hair colourant section, where the shelves groaned under the weight
of diverse boxes bearing the saccharine smiles of glamorous, successful,
greyless women. Nope, hair colourants for men are tucked away with the
discreetness normally reserved for Durex, tactfully arranged under the
catch-all ''Men's'' section, alongside all the shaving paraphernalia,
ready to be hidden in the shopping basket under a giant can of Gillette
foam.
For any man tempted into the kind of vanity and falsehood which comes
naturally to us chicks, the various brands are convincingly macho. While
female hair dyes have names like the blatantly false Simply Natural or
the gushy, gooey Colour Confidence or Loving Care, the male products opt
for scientific nuance, like the infamous Grecian 2000 or Restoria or the
magnificently named Formula 16, a quite-inspired moniker with its twin
allusions of laboratory gravity and Brands Hatch machismo.
While brands like Loving Care twitter on about lustrous, silky locks,
Restoria and Formula 16 go for hard-hitting facts; ''over time all hair
colour fades as we produce less Melanin'' they pompously inform. Feel
discomfited to learn that I am inadequate in the Melanin department.
But I've had time to get used to it, having spotted my first grey hair
at the tender age of 17. Actually, I didn't spot it, a so-called mate
did, plucking it from my head with vicious glee while I shrieked ''that
means another 10 grey hairs will grow back in its place'', tried
unsuccessfully to stick it back in my head, then hurtled down to Boots
for a packet of Glints and a lifetime of chemical dependency. And it
ain't time to shake the habit yet. Now, where did I put those plastic
gloves?

Clare Henry revels in Edith Simon's chatty approach to portrait
painting
EDITH SIMON stopped me in mid-sentence at a National Galleries party
with the question: ''Does columbine mean anything to you?'' I looked
vague. It rang no bells. Was she thinking of the Italian commedia
dell'arte figure, Harlequin's sweetheart, or the flower? Several months
later, again in passing, she asked me the same question, adding, ''Have
you still got your black and silver jacket? I'd like to do your
portrait.''
And so last Christmas I posed in her Edinburgh studio, standing, as is
my habit, pen in hand. As she drew, she asked another question. ''Can
you monologue? It keeps the face alive. Animation makes an enormous
difference to the look of a person. That's why I always ask my sitters
to keep talking. Otherwise you mustn't move!''
The main drawback was that Simon didn't want to hear anything
interesting; anything she might want to listen to. That would distract
her. I found it surprisingly hard, indeed almost impossible, to talk
about nothing, and tailed off now and again. I was also dying to ask
questions. Although I knew her work, I knew little about her.
She wouldn't let me see her drawings of me. (She draws superbly,
''It's the foundation of everything.'') I had to wait months till the
picture was completed -- and I was thrilled with the result. The
columbines, (flowers from her sister's garden it transpired) which fill
the foreground are indeed my kind of flowers in exactly my favourite
colours. How did she guess?
And like others who have sat for her: Tim Clifford, Lord Keir Fraser,
the Bellanys, Lady Rosebery, Andrew Brown, Virginia Izzo and new Fringe
director Hilary Strong, I too can say I recognise me very strongly in
the picture.
My portrait, along with that of Strong, Clifford, Sir Anthony and Lady
Wheeler, her small grandaughter and others, is now part of her Festival
exhibition in the Engine Shed, St Leonard's Lane. It's her twentieth
Edinburgh Festival show; and there's new work for a new venue. For years
she was a regular at the Chambers Street Centre where I first met her in
the 1980s. Then her catalogues said ''Not subsidised by the Scottish
Arts Council'', later, ''Still not subsidised by the Scottish Arts
Council.''
''I'm a maverick -- and I do like to do a bit of tightrope walking. A
maverick doesn't run with the herd, it stays away from the corral and
fits into no pigeonhole. It has to blow its own trumpet, knowing that to
be unclassified is to be suspect.''
Her daughter, Antonia Reeve the photographer, says: ''My mother has
suffered because she chose to work outside the mainstream; didn't want
to be part of the gallery system but organise her own exhibitions.
You've got to be driven to do that. I admire her.
''She's been a great role model. Very disciplined.''
Despite this she's made quite a niche for herself with her unusual
''scalpel painting'' using a difficult and unique technique of paper cut
invented by Simon herself.
With her blonde wig, theatrical clothes and blue glasses, Simon is a
colourful figure. Outspoken, (''one feels obliged to come out with a
definite comment sometimes''), a brilliant draughtswoman, she has the
added talent of being highly articulate, as her audio-visual
presentations demonstrate. No surprise when you learn that she was a
professional writer for 30 years with 17 books, non-fiction as well as
novels, to her name.
''I started my career as an art student at 15 at the Slade. But I
didn't stay. It was as though the Impressionists had never lived. I felt
I couldn't learn anything there. I was summonded by the principal. He
said I was obviously a rebel. Then I went to the Central School. I guess
I was opinionated but I soon made a lot of older friends so I dropped
out to become a founder member of the AIA along with Roland Penrose,
Misha Black, and James Boswell. I did all my learning in a practical
way.''
The AIA (Artists International Association) began in 1933 as an
important radical left-wing force. Members included Henry Moore, Piper,
Pasmore, John Berger, and Carel Weight. Simon's group portrait of the
first AIA committee was exhibited in their 1934 show. Boswell
remembered: ''She was very young then and had not begun writing.'' The
AIA had a social focus too. Simon and 30 others shared a 1938 holiday on
the Ile de Re where they painted a mural for their favourite cafe.
Aged just 23, Bodley Head published her first book. Even then she
tackled big subjects: Moses, Luther, behaviour and motivation. Although
still painting and printmaking on the side, she decided: ''At that time
my essays in art were somehow undirected, haphazard, floundering.
Writing was what I most wanted to do. I loved it. Art was a secondary
back-up occupation helping recharge the batteries when stuck. In the end
I managed to live on my writing.''
One novel was based on Edinburgh University's department of genetics,
which her husband helped found after the war. Dr Reeve still works
exhaustively, being editor of a new Encyclopedia of Genetics. ''Eric has
always been very supportive of my work -- thank heavens!''
Antonia, one of three offspring, remembers her mother ''writing all
the time''. She was extremely successsful. Her book on Frederick the
Great was translated into German. She still gets royalties. But she
managed to give us kids lots of time. She loves children. She would have
had 10 if she could.''
Even then Simon admits: ''People, their make-up, reactions and
relationships being my chief interest, I never could resist doing
portraits: interpretations of character in visual shorthand.''
About 1970 or so Simon went back to art. ''A moment came when what I
had to say could be better said pictorially. If you no longer want to do
it, to push a pen becomes the hardest thing in the world. Art's very
powerful. It's the most serious thing in my life.''
One of her strengths is her readiness to explain. Her videos are a
model of clarity and information. Why did she make them?
''It seemed called for. Learning to see and analyse is the most
difficult thing there is.'' She is also happy to explain her intricate,
complex technique of cutting through seven or eight layers of different
coloured paper to make her portraits.
Hilary Strong, the new Festival Fringe director, also has her portrait
in Simon's exhibition. ''It's very theatrical and theatre is part of my
psyche. I really love my portrait. It's glamorous and show-bizzy.
Edith's managed to catch the mix of theatre and administration that is
my life. And I'm tickled to see that I'm worth more than Tim Clifford!
He's a snip at #1300. I'm #2000!''
Simon says: ''For the six-week duration of the work I will love my
subjects with an absorbing passion, warts and all. Sometimes my empathy
includes a form of X-ray. I don't stay on the surface.'' Sure enough my
columbine did turn out to be prophetic!
Having hung 70 pictures for her Festival show, you would expect her to
take a break. Not at all. She has three works on the go: a portrait
commission, a male nude plus carnival mask plus a Marriage at Cana on
the easel in the Engine Shed -- so she can demonstrate. In an age when
art often seems to specialise in alienation, Simon is that rare
creature: a true communicator.

Adapting comfortable men's clothes to accentuate the female figure
long ago sold the fairer sex on the practicalities of suits and
trousers. Anne Simpson finds modern-day masculine lines can add of sense
of masqerade to a woman's life.
EVER since Eve swiped the fig leaves from somewhere under Adam's nose,
women have been plundering the male wardrobe shamelessly. Bertie
Wooster's sports jackets, Astaire's baggy pants, Chandler's slouch
coats, Napolean's breeches, the cavalry's great coat, Glen Miller's
tuxedo, and every gentleman's club waistcoat, bowler, tie and brogues .
. . the inventory is endless. In women's hands these are not the
underground spoils of cabaret but flagrant daytime stuff.
When, some years ago, Calvin Klein adapted Y-fronts for wear by women
a man might justifiably have asked if anything remained of his attire
that was exclusively masculine. And from the depths of the wardrobe
would have come the reply: ''Nothing, except perhaps the monocle.'' Why
crossover dressing should be so infinitely popular among women concerns
the special ease and practicality of male clothes. Pants are
comfortable, pants are liberating, and today when dress designers try to
kill them off in a flurry of new skirt lengths the market responds with
closed chequebooks, demanding that they think again.
Common sense, of course, is only part of the story. The real seduction
lies in the unexpected. As with so much of fashion the lure is
masquerade.
Coco Chanel was the first to understand the style potential of a great
male robbery when, in the early twenties, she cut up a man friend's
casual clothes, transforming them into an irrestible trouser suit for
women. It took a brave woman to attempt anything so reckless (one
presumes, for the sake of friendship, that she never dared to do it
twice), but that act of creative wantonness demonstrated Chanel's genius
for sensing what women wanted a split second before they knew it
themselves.
And so Chanel changed female dress forever, making her, in the eyes of
George Bernard Shaw, one of the two most influential women of the
twentieth century. The other, he said, was Marie Curie.
At the core of such skill was the ability to avoid straightforward
plagarism or any foray into transvestite parady. Instead, Chanel used
masculine lines to accentuate the feminine, and every woman who,
allegedly without thinking, robs a man of his shirt now knows the value
of that particular trick. Outsize clothing on a woman achieves an
enticing paradox; a sort of worldly vulnerability epitomised by Diane
Keaton as Annie Hall, and still maintained in her eighties today by that
marvellously sophisticated waif, Katharine Hepburn, ambling through
Central Park in moleskins, parka and barrow boy cap.
But 10 years ago designers contorted the mannish theme by foisting on
career women the look of an overpaid bouncer: pushy walk, grim
countenance, shoulders solidly padded for crashing in the door of a
rival drugs den. Now, five years off the new millennium, macho woman is
down and out, the world tired of her over-bearing manner and cumbersome
rig-outs.
In her place, the urbane free spirit glides through the city, a
creature coolly poised in slender trousers of lightweight, pastel tweed,
next-to-nothing smoking jackets, or the Dandyish elan of cravats and
stock tie blouses, frockcoats and abbreviated redingotes.
With such clothes a woman affirms that it is still smart to wear
almost everything a man does, but only in versions scaled to her
physique. However, that state of grace perishes the moment she
carelessly mimics the way men stride, stand or sit. Here the rule
remains that old Chanel dictum about emulating a man rather than
imitating him.
But a woman in man's clothing should also pitch for surprise by
selecting memorable accessories: a lace camisole beneath a hacking
jacket; pearls dipping inside the incline of a waistcoat; earrings which
add some classy sparkle to severity; and a brooch that hints at drama
with perhaps one of those jewelled arrows piercing a lapel.
In her day Marlene Dietrich took to pants with a panache that no other
female star could muster, using crossover dressing to demonstrate a
mysterious quality, something provocative, intelligent, contradictory
and amusing. For Dietrich it was independence of spirit that mattered.
She was the nihilist of glamour and, in that sense, the compadre of
Chanel.
Two women subverting fashion with such careless chic they could
pretend clothes simply didn't count at all.

Music
I BET that Scandinavian mezzo-soprano Randi Stene, who yesterday
opened the Queen's Hall series of morning recitals at this year's
Festival, was relieved when the ordeal was over.
If the first half of her recital was, at best, indifferent, then it
was only partly her fault. Distractions and extraneous noise were flung
at her from every direction. Worse than that was the dogged insistence
of the near-capacity audience to applaud every single thing she did.
As with Jessye Norman earlier this year in Glasgow, the effect on the
singer's concentration, to say nothing of the flow of the recital
programme, was utterly destructive. (Pianist Havard Gimse chewed grimly
and played on.) Whereas big Jessye, however, had intervened and told the
audience to stop applauding in the middle of linked sets of songs, Randi
Stene soldiered on. Or attempted to.
Through Schubert, through Brahms and through Zemlinsky, the mindless
clappers persisted. The girl -- who has a polished, gleaming voice,
though she is weak at extremes of her register -- was obviously
intimidated. Her concentration was all over the place (as were her
eyes).
In the second half, she took things into her own hands in a Dvorak
cycle, plunging into the next song before the deadly hands could be
brought together. She relaxed, she salvaged it, and there was some real
quality singing in her final Grieg selection. And I thought these
audiences were sophisticated. Ha.

A CALL for substantial investment to boost jobs in Edinburgh's Wester
Hailes housing estate was backed last night by local councillors.
District councillor Willie Dunn, who has represented South Hailes
since 1992, said: ''To me they have done nothing to create jobs. That's
the bottom line.
He claimed the Urban Partnership had done ''half of its job''.
He said there was more poverty in his ward, with an unemployment rate
of about 30%. ''The one thing the partnership has achieved is that the
image of Wester Hailes is not as bad as it was.''
Ms Lynne Main, chairwoman of Wester Hailes Representative Council,
said: ''The first five years have really looked at the physical
regeneration of the area. They have made great strides with that. The
area does look nicer and we are pleased with that.
''Overall, peoples' circumstances haven't really changed. No great
inroads have been made into unemployment. People have somewhere nice to
live but they don't have a job.''
Responding to their comments, Mr William Docherty, chief executive of
the partnership, said that their job was only half done.
''We recognise that most of the efforts in the next five years will be
directed towards economic development, improving the economy and
reducing unemployment levels.''
The researchers said the percentage of expenditure devoted to
improving the area's human assets must rise significantly in the next
phase.
The partnership objectives included halving the gap between the Wester
Hailes unemployment rate and the substantially lower rate for Edinburgh
over five years.

WHITFIELD was Dundee's idealistic answer in the sixties to the need
for slum clearance.
Communities bred in the Victorian tenements of Lochee, the Wellgate,
and Hilltown, with their shared outside toilets, were to be replaced
with high-rise communities.
The maisonettes and multi-storey flats with bathrooms and spacious
accommodation made Whitfield attractive to many young families in the
sixties.
However, the community, which was to grow to 12,000 -- larger than the
population of Forfar -- lacked the amenities of a tiny village, let
alone a modest county town.
Most critically of all, the town planners did not envisage the
consequences of Dundee's industrial decline, the return of mass
unemployment, and the growth of a drug culture.
Whitfield, the socialist dream, became more of a nightmare, and
families queued up to leave.
The transformation in the estate is all the more remarkable, given
Whitfield's notorious status in Scotland as a ''problem scheme''.
Since 1982, #55m of public money has been spent on rehabilitating the
area.
It has achieved a surprising success. More than 1600 of the old
unpopular houses have been demolished; 550 new houses have been built;
330 homes have been modernised, and security improvements have been made
to a further 900 houses.
Last night, Ms Kate McLean, Labour leader of Dundee District Council,
said: ''The district council has worked closely with the community for
many years and this latest recognition of the Whitfield success
demonstrates that results can be achieved by working in partnership with
other agencies.''

WILLIAM RUSSELL feels the heat of Russian film-making in Burnt By the
Sun and finds The Neon Bible a thumping bore
HIGH summer in 1936. Life in the country dacha of Sergei Kotov, hero
of the Bolshevik Revolution, his young wife, Maroussia (Ingeborga
Dapkunaite) and their enchanting little daughter, Nadia (Nadia
Mikhalkov) seems sweet in Nikita Mikhalkov's Oscar-winning film, Burnt
By the Sun. The illusion of high comedy, that this is a tale of smiles
of a long summer's day, is created only to be shattered at the end. The
film is a tragedy, a tale about people burnt by the sun of revolution.
The delightful daughter Nadia plays games and wheedles favours from
everyone, Kotov, his parents, and the inevitable hangers-on one finds in
those extended Russian families familiar from Chekhov. They squabble and
make up, while outside the countryside life unfolds as it has done for
centuries.
The family eat huge meals, go for a picnic, swim, while a lorry driver
with a load of furniture, unable to find his destination, drives about
the countryside in ever-decreasing circles, the peasants, harvesting the
corn, turn to Kotov (Nikita Mikhalkov) for help when a military exercise
threatens to send tanks over their crops, and are busy building a
mysterious structure whose purpose is not quite clear.
But the comedy, the manifest happiness are just an illusion for this
is a world without foundations ruled over by a monster, Joseph Stalin,
who is about to lay waste to everything.
A good-looking young man, Dimitri (Oleg Menchikov), Maroussia's lover
before she met Kotov, arrives unexpectedly, and is welcomed into the
family with joy, a prodigal returned. He tells Nadia fairy stories,
which clearly mean more than she understands, flirts with Maroussia, and
engages in wary exchanges with Kotov. He turns out to be the Angel of
Death.
This brilliant, marvellous film, impeccably performed, superbly
directed, breaks the heart. It is quite simply a masterpiece.
Unmissable.
Terence Davies The Neon Bible is based on a book by John Kennedy Tool
about a young boy (Jacob Tierney) growing up in an American Bible-Belt
town in the 1940s with his bullying father (Denis Leary), his
downtrodden, sensitive mother (Diana Scarwid) and his gutsy Aunt Mae
(Gena Rowlands), a bar-room ''chantoose'' of uncertain years whose
career is going nowhere for obvious reason -- she sings pretty
dreadfully.
The boy dreams of escape, Aunt Mae encourages him, his father bullies
him, his mother suffers in silence, and the soundtrack is laden with the
popular songs of the period. Sounds familiar? We are, of course, in
Terence Davies Land, that country of the past he made his own in the
undeniably marvellous Distant Voices, Still Lives, and to which he
returned with diminishing effect in the sequel, The Long Day Closes.
Translated from working-class Liverpool to the American South, Davies
proves less assured and his tricks, the use of music, the way the camera
glides from a realistic setting into a highly stylised one, the
fascination with strong, but rather louche women are becoming over
familiar. He is a fine film-maker, but he needs to extend his range, not
plough the same old furrow, which is what he has done here.
Rowlands warbles in a whisky voice and creates an endearing, sad
loser as Mae, while Tierney is fine as the boy but ultimately it is all
terribly inconsequential. The press audience booed it when it was shown
at Cannes, a cruelly unfair verdict because it is not a bad film, just a
rather disappointing one from a director of such high talent. Try fresh
fields and pastures new, Mr Davies, or you risk becoming a Johnny One
Note bore.

PARTNERSHIP schemes to regenerate four of Scotland's most deprived
housing estates received mixed reports yesterday.
Whitfield in Dundee emerges as the outstanding success in interim
evaluation studies carried out by research teams from Glasgow and
Bristol universities for the Scottish Office.
Ferguslie Park in Paisley, Castlemilk in Glasgow, and Wester Hailes in
Edinburgh were judged less well but with some achievements in specific
areas.
The Scottish Office launched the partnership schemes in 1988 as part
of its policy New Life for Urban Scotland.
They were an attempt to harness local communities and public and
private sector bodies to combat poor image and poverty of the estates
and develop housing, employment, facilities, and the environment.
Of the four, Wester Hailes got off to the worst start. A new estate,
it had gone into decline before it was even completed.
''The choice of Wester Hailes as a partnership area was interpreted by
many parties as primarily a political decision, located as it was in the
constituency of the then Secretary of State for Scotland.
''In any event, relationships between the local authorities and the
Scottish Office were difficult at the outset,'' the researchers said.
The key area of creating jobs for people has not been a resounding
success. Although #60m had been invested over five years in Wester
Hailes, some of which was new money, less than 5% was in areas of
employment, training, and business development.
''Poor educational experiences, the consequences of long-term
unemployment and related social disadvantages mean that a substantial
investment is required to link local people with employment. This cost
is consistently underestimated in regeneration initiatives,'' the
researchers said.
Similarly in Castlemilk, employment targetting had been disappointing,
particularly involving local people in construction projects.
Ferguslie Park fared better on jobs: numbers registered as unemployed
fell by 40% in six years and the main cause in the reduction was due to
economic regeneration work by the partnership.
At Whitfield, unemployment was double the Dundee average in 1988 but
it fell faster on the estate than in the city, particularly in the early
years.
The approach to housing and effective collabaration of residents and
outside bodies is identified as the principal trigger for transforming
Whitfield from a ''dreary, squalid, and unsafe council estate, which
most residents wished to leave'' into a ''mostly attractive residential
area''.
Castlemilk also reversed its poor image so that ''a real, if fragile,
local housing market involving municipal, social landlord, and private
ownership is emerging''. Requests to move into the area doubled between
1988 and 1992.
The Scottish Office put a positive gloss on the research. It said
unemployment had fallen by 20% and more than 2000 new homes had been
built on the estates. The proportion of those satisfied or very
satisfied living on them had risen from 54% to 71% and those wishing to
leave had fallen from 40% to 23%.
Mr Raymond Robertson, Scottish Office Minister responsible for urban
policy, said the findings were very encouraging.
Mr Fergus Ewing, SNP business spokesman, said: ''The problems of
long-term unemployment, drug addiction, and crime have not been properly
addressed. One part of the answer is a budget for jobs and that's what
the SNP will deliver.''
Deputy Shadow Scottish Secretary John McFall said Labour supported
partnership schemes because they allowed communities to take decisions
for themselves.
''However, it would appear from these schemes that the issue of
economic development has been missed out. Only a proper approach on a
long-term basis in this area will be effective in reducing unemployment,
poverty, and alienation'', he said.

SINCE we are in a period of particularly depressing political trivia,
I do not hesitate to hail as one of its more important events the
commencement next session at Edinburgh University of classes in
nationalism by my old friend and sparring partner, Tom Nairn.
He thus resumes a career which for most of his academic generation
ended in more or less honourable early retirement some years ago. They
have all been put out to grass while he, a portly but otherwise youthful
63, is just getting into his stride round the second lap.
He did occupy a teaching position once, but quit it in 1968. The date
is significant: what Daniel Cohn-Bendit was to the Sorbonne, and Rudi
Dutschke to the Free University of Berlin, Tom was to Hornsey College of
Art. I can no longer remember what exactly happened in Hornsey to make
it for a while the focus of the seething revolutionary aspirations of
the working class. No doubt it involved Tariq Ali, Vanessa Redgrave, and
a cast of thousands. In any event, Tom found himself afterwards without
a job, and has never held another.
Where are they now, the blithe spirits of the heady summer of 1968?
Dutschke is dead, Cohn-Bendit is that most parasitical of creatures, a
Euro-MP, while Ali and Redgrave carry on a life of shameless
self-indulgence. For all the excitement of those years, little of their
legacy has proved permanent, and the generation that lived through them
has turned out to be one not so much of vipers as of slow-worms: blind,
harmless, and easily trodden upon. But among its few solid achievements
Tom Nairn's thinking and writing ought to be numbered.
Equally, I am sure he is and will remain more considerable than the
academic cohort from which he then parted company. The 1960s saw a huge
expansion of British universities, which had its benefits but also
filled them with third-rate players of the system who happened to be in
the right place at the right time. They matured into dead wood which has
only with difficulty been cut out in the Thatcherite era, and not
completely yet. Among the ill consequences has been, till now, to keep
in limbo a patently meritorious mind like Tom Nairn's.
That casts the Scottish universities especially in a bad light. Full
marks to Edinburgh for having taken Tom on, though with his intellectual
pedigree it can hardly be counted a bold move. It does register that
something has been happening in the country of sufficient importance for
even the universities to take note of, but certainly not before time.
A frequent complaint against them is that they are agents of
anglicisation, and in some senses that is obviously true. I would still
put it differently and deplore their utter, voluntary subjection to the
state.
They entered into it on an assumption that the state would always be
run by people from the same class as themselves and amenable to their
wheedling, but have since found out that he who lives by patronage dies
by patronage.
It is not as if, under this regime, British universities have exactly
enjoyed a golden age. On the contrary, they have acquired the usual
characteristics of agencies of the state, notably a penchant for order,
regularity, and boringness. In Scotland especially this has reinforced
the pussy-footing respectability, the commitment to authoritarian
mediocrity, which is a besetting, and very traditional, national sin.
One of its aims is to exclude people like Tom Nairn.
For two or three decades, after all, we have had going on in Scotland
a complex of phenomena -- in politics, in literature and other high
arts, in popular culture, in historiography -- which in total can
reasonably be called a national revival.
Its origins are hard to explain, and perhaps posterity will never rate
it as high as I am doing here. But there can be no mistaking the
outburst of confidence behind it, a confidence scarcely seen in the
country since before the First World War.
Yet for too long all this was more or less ignored in the
universities, as too difficult and not respectable enough. To take just
the field in which Tom Nairn specialises, political scientists have
themselves ruefully acknowledged the very meagre upheavals in Scottish
politics, the rise of nationalism in particular. Nearly all the best
work has come from outside, from Tom himself, and from others involved
in the real world, where they do not have to worry about sticking their
necks out and ruining their scholarly reputations.
Nor is politics the only subject to be straitjacketed in this way.
There were always exceptions, and their number has grown, but in general
universities have shared the metropolitan assumption that Scotland is a
small-time dump where nothing, at least nothing worthy of study, ever
happens.
It is impossible to imagine that, say, the American system of higher
education would close its eyes to developments in the society round it.
On the contrary to keep up with them, almost with every passing moment,
is one of its obsessions. That the system is decentralised and
half-private, needing to deal with students' actual interests, may not
be unconnected with the obsession. We, by contrast, run a system which
makes universities forever gaze at their own navels. So, far from having
academic freedom to defend, they become merely protectors of their own
privileges.
It would be too much to say that Tom Nairn's appointment can change
any of this. He may, of course, himself be changed. He has an unrivalled
capacity for being magnificently wrong, but that is often true of
important thinking, and I should hate to see him lose it. If ever he
starts to get things right, I shall advise him to forsake the poisoned
groves of academe.

director of education Bruce Robertson told councillors yesterday the
speed with which the global computer network is expanding made it
essential that Grampian provide schools with policy and guidance on its
use. With the Education committee's approval, he now plans a circular to
be sent out to all heads of educational establishments. Internet
Providers are to filter the choice of materials to which pupils can get
access but depute director of education Bruce Robertson said back-up

EFFORTS to regenerate the Paisley housing estate of Ferguslie Park
have been overshadowed in recent months by scandal.
Last month, the Scottish Office announced an independent audit into
the use of urban aid programme funds by Ferguslie Park Community
Holdings Ltd. That move followed controversy over the running of the
community business's subsidiary company, FCB Enterprise Security Ltd,
which is being investigated by police and Renfrew district councillors.
The security company has denied strenuously any allegations against
it.
What no-one would deny is that the area has borne a crippling burden
of social problems for many years.
Built as a slum clearance area, Ferguslie Park's population declined
from more than 12,000 in 1971 to just 5000 in 1988. In that year, note
the authors of the interim evaluation report on the partnership, 82% of
households had total annual incomes of less than #5000. Skill levels
were low and educational qualifications minimal. Half of the land area
was more or less derelict.
The report records substantial improvements under the partnership.
Several hundred homes have been built and the district council has
modernised hundreds of existing properties. A community park, a sports
centre, a police post, and the multi-purpose Tannahill civic centre have
been completed.
On economic regeneration, the authors say that emphasis on improving
the skills and self-confidence of job seekers has achieved
''considerable success''. The number of people on the unemployment
register fell by 40% between 1988 and 1994, and 1479 job placements were
recorded by the partnership between January 1989, and March 1994.

CASTLEMILK, one of Europe's largest housing estates, presented an
extremely bleak picture when the partnership began.
High unemployment, low skill levels, unpopular housing in poor
conditions, inadequate shopping facilities, a poor health record, and
high crime levels -- these are just some of the characteristics
described by the authors of the interim evaluation report.
So what progress has been made? Among the successes highlighted in the
report are improvements in the housing stock and choice.
More than #110m has been spent or committed to social housing and #20m
private-sector investment has been made. A third of the dwellings have
been improved and six housing associations and co-operatives have been
formed.
''Castlemilk is perceived more favourably by residents and there has
been an increase in the numbers of people wishing to stay in, or move
back to, Castlemilk,'' notes the report.
With little prospect of attracting major employers to the estate, the
partnership has concentrated on improving the skills of local people and
access to job opportunities elsewhere.
There have been more than 1800 job placements and more than 500
training places from the Castlemilk Economic Development Agency (CEDA),
one of the bodies in the partnership.
However, long-term unemployment continues at high levels -- more than
15%, compared with the Glasgow average of less than 14%. Incomes remain
low and dependence upon benefits was actually higher last year than in
1990.
On a brighter note, the report points to environmental improvements,
innovative practices in education, health, and community care, and a
drop in crime rates.

IT is, of course, a serious subject, not to say ''a serious problem'',
and there is every chance she'll hate us for bringing this up once
again, but are we right in detecting an ulterior motive in the campaign
launched by the SNP's Roseanna Cunningham yesterday to bring more
international film-makers to Scotland?
Consider: the MP for Perth and Kinross is a noted science-fiction
movie aficionado, so much so that she even shares a home with a
life-size cardboard cut-out of Mr Spock (highly realistic, at least when
compared to certain of the party's leading figures). Consider, too, that
the Nationalists are ever keen to promote proper representations of wir
modern cultural identity n'that, unlike the somewhat dodgy old versions
advanced in Rob Roy and Braveheart, even if Ireland's contribution to
the making of the latter happens to have prompted the SNP's campaign.
Given that the warped factor on the Diary is always fairly high, and
that the Nats are seeking opinions and constructive ideas from all
quarters, the Diary therefore looks forward to Star Trek XV: The Search
for Scottie's Kilt, the searing parable of one man's Scottish accent
boldly going where no Scottish accent has gone before, shot entirely on
location at the Perth conference.
A nation, Jim, but not as we know it.
Up in the air
LIKE many of you, no doubt, the Diary is in receipt of a communication
from those very relaxed people at Transcendental Meditation Regional
Headquarters (Edinburgh and Glasgow) offering a free video.
As is customary with the followers of the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the
man immortalised by John Lennon as ''Sexy Sadie'', remedies are promised
for just about everything -- stress, obesity, irritability, tumours,
heart disease, rotten relationships, flat feet -- though no mention is
made of how much it actually costs to learn TM's ''very simple
technique''.
What we don't get -- and this, like most things, may very well be our
problem -- is the absence of any mention of what ought to be the
organisation's unique selling point. In other words, not a word is
offered on the wonderful art of ''yogic flying''. This is odd.
True, cruel sceptics have in the past pointed out that TM's
contribution to aeronautics bears more than a passing resemblance to
bumping along the ground on your backside while maintaining a fixed grin
-- on your face, naturally -- but to our knowledge the meditating types
have yet to agree.
So what's the deal? Why bother to ''spontaneously'' develop a better
lifestyle, cure insomnia, or ''unfold your full potential'', even in
mixed company, when you could be cutting out the middle man on your next
package trip to Benidorm or jetting down to the pub for some in-flight
refuelling? Incidentally, TM ''requires no change in beliefs''. This
must be handy for those who'll believe anything.
Conflicting beliefs
OUT of the Mouths of Babes. It may not be the best question a child
has asked about the Balkans conflict, but we couldn't answer it. If
everyone has taken to referring routinely to the Bosnians as
''Muslims'', how come the peace-loving Serbs are never described as
Christians?
Take it as read
HAVING recorded something of a bogey ourselves by giving loyal readers
the chance to enjoy a splendid article by Raymond Jacobs twice, we may
be the last to talk. Nevertheless, we are no match for Edinburgh's
Evening News, a publication so proud of its work that it has taken to
printing entire pages more than once in the same edition and, if you
follow, on more than one occasion.
This points to one of two conclusions: either the News is determined
to ensure its readers don't miss those crucial hot stories, or staff
have taken a lead from the public and given up actually reading their
own paper.
Naturally we incline to the former theory, awed as we still are by the
immortal headline that appeared in the tabloid not so very long ago:
''Headline Goes Here''.
Campaign support
WELL, that's that. Festival over for another year. Two hours spent
snarling, misdirecting tourists -- ''Princes Street, sir? Certainly,
sir. Bottom of Leith Walk and turn right'' -- and handing out leaflets
marked ''Sod Off'' to wandering Fringe performers before we settle back,
content in the knowledge of a job well done.
Before we retire, however, there's still time for one shameless plug
for an event at the Fruitmarket Gallery Cafe tomorrow night. This has
nothing to do with stand-up comedy, in fact it isn't very funny at all,
but does feature Tom Leonard, Sandie Craigie, and James Kelman, not to
mention some live music.
Organised by Artists in Solidarity and the Scottish Bookfair of
Radical, Black and Third World Books, the night is a benefit for the
Stephen Lawrence Family Campaign. It will be followed by a similar event
in Glasgow, at Caledonian University's Queens College on Friday.
Why do we bring it up? Some of you might remember Stephen Lawrence: a
black English teenager brutally murdered two years ago whose case,
according to what the police told his family in March, was closed. The
Crown Prosecution Service also refused to accept new evidence and said
it would take no action.
Thus it was, and despite all official obstacles, that the boy's
parents were obliged to pursue a hitherto unheard-of private criminal
prosecution. Four men have now been charged with murder and committal
proceedings will take place next week. Hence the family's need for
support.
The Diary points all this out for no better reason than it somewhat
argues against the apparent conviction of Sir Paul Condon, the man who
runs the Metropolitan Police, that muggings by black teenagers are the
only sort of crimes worth bothering about. And if you still feel in need
of a proper, Festival-type laugh, console yourself with the thought that
despicable racist assaults never, ever happen in friendly Scotland.
The lost chord
FINALLY, the question on everyone's lips: is Jerry Garcia still
grateful? If not, why not?

FIFTY years ago yesterday Emperor Hirohito broadcast to the Japanese
nation for the first time. He said that the situation had not
necessarily developed to Japan's advantage and told his subjects that
they must ''endure the unendurable and suffer the insufferable''.
There was a last flurry of resistance as die-hard officers tried to
prevent the record of the emperor's speech reaching the studio. They
failed (32 were killed in the palace grounds), and the Imperial Japanese
Army and the people bowed to their fate.
The actual surrender took place aboard the battleship Missouri, in
Tokyo harbour on September 2. It was a theatrical event, stage-managed
by that most thespian of American generals, Douglas MacArthur. Just as
the Japanese Minister, dressed formally in a morning suit, drew himself
up after signing the instrument of surrender, a huge fleet of American
planes swept across the bay, dead on time, to demonstrate the power of
the United States.
The end of the war marked the birth of the modern world, after a
period of accelerated history: MacArthur, the general who commanded all
American forces in the western Pacific as the atomic era began, had, as
a child, been besieged in a fort by Indians armed with bows and arrows
in the American west. MacArthur's father was then an Indian fighter and
later a hero of the Union Army in the Civil War.
In one lifetime, America went from the Stone Age to the Atomic Age.
Two generations on, and the country shows but muted interest in the VJ
Day anniversary.
For VE-Day in Europe there were parades, memorial services, and a
universal celebration of the memory of the last good war, when we were
liberated from a dreadful tyranny. The Americans barely noticed.
President Clinton went across the river to Arlington Cemetery to lay a
wreath on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, and made an unmemorable
speech. Then he hopped in to a plane and flew to Moscow and boycotted
the military parades there as a gesture of disapproval of Russia's
Chechnya involvement. And that was it. There were no public
commemorations worth noting, no parades, no festivities, no
acknowledgement that America played a decisive part in defeating the
Nazis.
Now comes VJ Day, and once again there will be no fireworks, no
parades, nothing of any note. Mr Clinton will attend a ceremony at Pearl
Harbor, on the spot where George Bush commemorated the attack on the
50th anniversary, on December 7, 1991. Another anti-climax.
In contrast to Clinton and VE-Day, President Reagan made an immense
production of the 40th anniversary of D-Day, and the commemorations and
attendant festivities were a huge success, and delighted America. A
decade later, Bill Clinton tagged along behind the British and French
celebrations, and marked the end of the war hardly at all.
Perhaps his youthful opposition to the Vietnam War has left him with a
settled antipathy to all things military, to the extent that he cannot
even pretend to any enthusiasm for America's last ''good war''.
Partly, perhaps, it may be the natural resentment of the young at
their parents endlessly harping on their own victories. The notorious
libertarian streak of the 1960s was largely generated by youth's
reaction against the smug complacency of the Second World War
generation. Clinton and his cohorts had freed themselves from that
mindset -- and apparently are still firmly of the opinion that war
stories are boring when they are not evil.
The debate over the morality of Hiroshima has played a large part. The
revisionists have bombarded the newspapers and television with their
argument that dropping the bombs was a crime. They have not won the
debate (it still rages fiercely) but they have perhaps succeeded in
putting abroad the notion that to celebrate VJ Day means celebrating the
destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
But most central of all is the sad fact that the United States is not
the self-confident, proud, optimistic country that it was in the 1980s
when Reagan announced it was ''morning again in America''.
A more imaginative president than Clinton might have seized the
anniversaries to restore a little optimism to the American public. But I
suspect that under it all, Bill Clinton, too, suffers from the fin de
siecle malaise that afflicts so much of the country. It's more than a
little worrying when the British, of all people, can still work up
enthusiasm and public jollity, a general manifestation of national
self-confidence -- and America can't.

Following a cocaine seizure at Shotts, James Freeman considers the
case for mandatory testing in Scottish jails.
IN HIS report on Scottish prisons last year, the then chief of the
prison's inspectorate used the evocative phrase -- in relation to
visiting in jails -- ''the long, dark shadow cast by the drugs world''.
That shadow fell over Shotts Prison earlier this week with the
disclosure of a seizure of cocaine, albeit a relatively small quantity,
an event which raises a number of serious issues for a prison system
currently enjoying its lengthiest period of stability for years. The
major question has to be whether the latest disclosure strengthens the
case for an early introduction of random mandatory drug-testing in
Scottish jails and whether the Shotts seizure has hastened that day.
There are persuasive arguments against random testing; it does not,
for example, address the primary problem which is, that drugs are being
taken into our prisons, mainly if not exclusively at visiting times, and
on a regular basis. And, while it might be popular with some sections of
the public and with some sections of the populist media, it would almost
certainly prove highly unpopular with prisoners at a period in history
when the rejuvenated Scottish Prison Service has expounded the theory of
the responsible prisoner being provided with the opportunities to better
himself.
Would any gains accruing to the public -- the paymasters and the major
''customers'' of the prison system -- be outweighed by a decrease in
stability in the jails, or by damage to the better-quality relationships
which currently -- to the outsider at least -- appear to apply between
prisoners and staff?
There is a persistent feeling within the criminal justice system here
that random tests -- on the model being ironed out and debugged in
England and Wales at the moment -- are not that far away if for no other
reason than that it is an option available in Scotland under the last
Criminal Justice Act and that its introduction south of the Border,
under the present experimental basis, was associated with the then Home
Office Prisons' Minister, Mr Michael Forsyth.
The Home Office is coy about the results of the first six months of
random mandatory testing for drugs in the eight English jails where the
scheme is being piloted, but the early figures have been made available
in Parliament.
These showed that 36% of prisoners tested at random between February
and April tested positive, 32% of those having used cannabis, 1% heroin
and 1% tranquilisers. In the same period, Parliament was told, when
prisoners strongly suspected of having abused drugs were selected, 62%
of them tested positive.
The Home Office says that the mandatory urine tests did not lead to
any adverse reaction from prisoners in the eight pilot establishments --
Lindholme, Wakefield, Feltham YOI, Stoke Heath YOI, Pentonville,
Bristol, Holloway female prison and Weyland -- although it has to be
remarked that none of these institutions has the volatile reputation of
a prison such as Shotts with its high density of long-term,
high-security category criminals.
The obvious conclusion which can be drawn from the two sets of English
figures is that there is a more effective way of catching drug abusers
in jails than by random testing and that is by using the unique know-how
of the staff at the sharp end.
It may, of course, be wrong to prejudge Mr Forsyth's intentions. He is
known to be deeply interested in the Scottish Prison Service, a legacy
from his Home Office experiences, and he is known to be cautious about
the pace of the English rush towards private prisons and outside
participation through market testing.
His views on that may become clearer in the next few weeks but it
would not be surprising if it was closer to the idea of a healthy,
achieving public service delivering meaningful and productive custodial
regimes for the benefit of all of us.
There is another element, also political, in the argument and that is
that the prison officers -- who would have to administer compulsory,
random urine sampling -- would almost certainly be against it. Medical
and nursing staff refuse to have anything to do with compulsory sampling
on ethical grounds.
Mr Eddie Hunter, the chairman of the Scottish Prison Officers'
Association, said: ''I am not sure random mandatory testing would be
beneficial for anyone. I imagine by elimination it would establish who
the drug users are but in reality a good prison officer using his
knowledge of the prisoners is just as likely to be able to pinpoint the
most likely suspects.
''From my own experience in Shotts I would say that by far the great
majority of prisoners do not take drugs of any description. To impose
random testing on these men is bound to get an adverse reaction. There
is little to be gained.''
Mr Hunter also advocates caution in relation to the noises coming from
England in the wake of the Whitemoor Report on general toughening up of
visits procedure. Prisoners in Scotland have become used to a better
quality of open visiting which the majority do not abuse, he believes.
He is also pragmatic about the problems.
''As long as there is big money involved inside the prisons then the
sumggling in of drugs is going to be practically impossible to stamp out
totally. But as long as our members continue to be vigilant I am happy
with the situation. Very little gets missed,'' he said.
The real loser from any random testing programme in Scotland would be
the ground-breaking voluntary saliva-testing programme which, since
1991, has created for scientists, health officials, the social services
and the SPS itself an unrivalled picture of HIV incidence and injecting
and other high-risk behaviour inside Scottish prisons.
The survey work led by Dr Sheila Gore and Dr Graham Bird has been
widely praised; eight programmes have been carried out and of the 3564
prisoners, men and women, available to be tested, 82% volunteered.
The results broadly show what happens inside prison reflects what
happens in the communities from which the prisoners are drawn. Of the
volunteers, 27% said they had injected drugs at some time and 56% of the
adult men had injected drugs in prison at one time or another.
But yesterday Dr Gore (a researcher with the Medical Research Council
Biostatistics Unit at Cambridge) said the mass of data provided had
allowed the SPS to devise better informed, better designed drug
intervention programmes.
''It should be borne in mind that the man who gave the political
go-ahead for this voluntary saliva-testing programme in 1991 when it was
totally new was Michael Forsyth and everyone should be grateful to him
for that. It was a courageous act the wisdom of which has been
demonstrated.
''The SPS has followed through with a series of drug reduction
programmes but the fact is that there is a waiting list in the prisons
of men who want to get help. These men come forward and say they have a
problem which they want to tackle.
''The real problem is that the prison service does not have sufficient
resources to run enough of these programmes to meet the need,'' she
added.
The crunch could be that this enlightened and clearly beneficial
programme would be crippled by any imposition of mandatory testing on
prisoners here. In England a punishment tariff has been introduced along
with the swoops, 14 days loss of remission for having cannabis traces in
the urine, 21 days for a Class A drug.
NACRO, the English prisoner resettlement organisation, says that it
has had cases where prisoners have lost accommodation fixed up in
advance because their release date has been put back -- a
counter-productive side effect. Helen Edwards, NACRO's director of
communications, said: ''There is a lot of concern about drugs misuse in
prisons but random mandatory testing is not an answer. What is really
needed is more positive programmes to reduce demand inside.''
What has yet to emerge in England is the true monetary cost of
testing, although the first obvious cost is the #1680 needed to keep
someone inside for another month as a punishment for testing positive.
One informed source gave The Herald an estimate that random mandatory
testing is currently being shown to eat up around half the available
health care budget in any jail.
By the same token, a properly staffed drug reduction programme would
come in at about half the cost of random testing. The message from
England would therefore appear to be to avoid at any cost what looks
like another ''magic bullet'' solution from the endlesss Home Office
supply, and stick to the home-grown Scottish approach which may yet
bring longer-term benefits for our communities.

CASE NO. 2: Margaret Wilson and her husband Sonny.
THE first thing William ''Sonny'' Wilson did when he came out of a
coma three years ago, was to ask Margaret to marry him.
A year later she did, knowing that her husband would be totally
dependent upon her for the rest of their life together.
Sonny, a painter and decorator who was never off sick a day in his
life, suffered an aneurysm at the age of 52. He has been left
wheelchair-bound, almost completely blind, with impaired hearing, his
speech affected, and brain-damaged. Perhaps the hardest thing for his
family to bear is the change in his personality.
Margaret, 58, who gave up her job as a manageress of City Bakeries to
care for Sonny, says: ''My husband wakes me up in the morning and the
first thing he says is 'I love you', and I get a wee song in the
morning.''
But there are times, too, when his frustration is taken out on the one
closest to him and life is anything but sweet words and kisses.
When Margaret was expecting her eighth child her husband left her. She
and Sonny started going out together and he helped her and her children
through the hard times.
''I married him because he had nobody else to look after him. There
was no way I would see him put into a hospital, and he was good to me
when the kids were young,'' she said.
When he was lying in a coma and she prayed for him to get well enough
even to be in a wheelchair, she had no idea what life as a full-time
carer would be like. The worst was when he first came home to her.
''When he got out of hospital they took me into a wee room and said he
would be getting all the help in the world. If I needed a respite they
would take him in. The first day I got him out he took an epileptic fit.
The hospital just said to put him on his side, but with the size of him
I couldn't move him. I never got anything,'' she said.
With the help of her local MP Mike Watson -- she lives in Govanhill --
she eventually got Sonny into one of the Scotcare rehabilitation units
near Wishaw -- but he came out disappointed he still could not walk.
The Princess Royal Trust for carers provides a centre that Sonny can
go to through the day, Monday to Friday, which has provided him with an
interest in life and a more regular pattern to his day.
''If I ever win the lottery, that's who I would give the biggest part
to. If it was not for them, I am telling you straight, I would not be
sitting here just now,'' she said.
In the past year, thanks mainly to Sonny's occupational therapist
Heather Bunting, Margaret has been able to put Sonny into respite care.
There are some positive moves, however. She now receives the
independent living allowance for carers and support from the Princess
Royal Trust carers' network. And there's the respite.
''I have seen me, before I got this week off now and then, smashing
plates off the wall, and then whoever comes in next gets my anger.''
She has started getting panic attacks and has been on
anti-depressants.
''There's not one prisoner in the house, there are two prisoners. If I
am out anywhere he panics. I am the only one he will let put him on the
commode,'' she said.
''I do feel bitter,'' said Margaret.
''I see couples about our age that we used to go about with, and you
say, 'That's no right'. We should be enjoying ourselves just now. I have
had eight children and I have my ninth now. He's like a wee bairn,'' she
said.

CASE NO. 1: Isobel and Dave Allen and their daughter Susan.
TOTAL dependence on her parents means that Susan Allan can never be
left on her own or she will hurt herself.
She has Rett Syndrome, a rare disorder which affects one in 12,000 of
female births and causes profound mental and physical handicap. She can
smile and vocalise, but the most distressing symptom is that she is
violent towards herself.
During the week she goes to Langlands School in Govan, although she
will leave next year when she turns 16, and five or six times a year she
goes to a respite unit. While she's at home she needs constant attention
and stimulus.
''The way we know she's wakened is we hear the thumps of her fist
hitting her face. That's her communicating that she's distressed,'' said
her father Dave Allan, an electrician who lives in Cambuslang.
Susan's mother Isobel is a trained counsellor who works with other
carers. It is something she developed as a means of coping with her own
frustrations of having to live with someone who was violent and
unpredictable.
Part of her work involves speaking as a carer to nurses as part of
their training and her most heartfelt plea is for professionals,
particularly doctors, to provide better emotional support for carers.
She feels that professionals need to understand some of the day-to-day
problems that carers face -- like the fact that if Isobel wants to go to
the toilet, she has to take Susan with her because she can't be left on
her own; like not knowing whether she will be able to finish the cup of
coffee or the meal she has made.
Even when respite does come, it can take a couple of days to wind down
to a more normal pace of life, by which time the person being cared for
is back home.
A lot of long-term problems suffered by carers stem from the fact that
the initial support in the early days was not there, Isobel said.
''You carry that bitterness with you. If there's another life, I am
coming back as director of education and health. I want to insist that
professional staff have to be highly skilled in human relationship
skills,'' she said.
Nurses, doctors, and social workers too often have problems dealing
with carers' feelings, particularly their anger, so they label some
carers as ''aggressive''.
Those less able to assert themselves tend to fall into the trap that
if they are offered any facilities, they should be grateful, even if
they are not what they need or want. Instead, they should feel they have
the right to say thank-you, but we need something different, she said.
The Allans are anxious to impress upon people that their life,
although problematic, is still blessed.
''We are just so fortunate that we have so much going for us. Dave's
got a job, we are still together and have been married for 27 years. We
have a house with a garden. We count our blessings and there are many of
them.
''We would never have had so much richness in our lives without Susan.
Susan does not have all her health, but when she is happy I think she
has got everything,'' said Isobel.
Her husband added: ''When you listen to people moaning about ordinary
things in life you smile to yourself and think 'You are lucky'.''
But they both accept that with Susan's care their main priority, they
cannot always be there for their two sons, Stephen, 25, and Scott, 20.
''If one of our sons phones us with something really important, we
cannot always be there for him. Our boys have had to find their own
coping levels. We have been open and honest with our sons, but it has
not been easy for them, especially in the years when Susan did not
sleep,'' said Isobel.
Ironically, just before Susan's disorder was diagnosed, the Allans had
been accepted by the social work department to provide foster care for
handicapped children on a weekend basis. The aim was to give the foster
children's parents respite.
Almost 15 years on, just when they need such a service, it does not
exist. If handed a magic wand, that is exactly what Isobel would provide
-- a community-based respite network.
''There have been real changes in the past 10 years, in a positive
sense. Carers have a higher profile, but there are still horror
stories.''
But the professionals still need to learn to be more human, she feels.
''I don't want people to take care of me, I want them to care for
me.''

AFTER Yo Yo Ma's four-hour marathon with Bach on Monday, last night's
90-minute Dvorak epic seemed like a snip. But in fact the Stabat Mater,
written by Dvorak in a period which saw the death of all three of his
children, is an epic: 10 movements, almost all of them slow, a huge arch
of intensity -- from darkness to light -- relieved by a relaxed musical
radiance in the middle.
In truth, the Stabat Mater is an uneven work, some great music which
occasionally flags, is over-extended, and has some moments of plain
gaucherie. That its performance last night was so gripping and
concentrated was down to the glorious singing of the Edinburgh Festival
Chorus, a superb set of soloists, and the conductor John Eliot Gardiner.
The Philharmonia may be London's finest band, but last night,
accompanying this lot, they were not on their best form. Whether it was
down to Gardiner's direction or not, there were too many tentative or
even splodgy entries to be wholly convincing. (A few of these glitches
found their way into the chorus, too, though not quite to the same
effect.)
Gardiner, with immense conducting gestures, found a balance between
austerity and lyrical expression in the work that completely avoided
sentimentality -- a typical coolness from this man, though the sheer
melodic qualities that stream and soar through the work were luminously
highlighted. It may have been slow; it didn't feel like it.
From the Edinburgh Festival Chorus he drew a huge range of dynamics
and colour, from the threshold of audibility to a blazing, full-throated
roar. Their singing in the flowing central movements, which came as a
sort of pastoral relief from the solemnity of much of the work, was
smooth, creamy, and gorgeous. In the last movement they were unleashed,
beginning subdued, then blossoming through a huge crescendo into the
inimitable EFC at full power, a unique sound.
The world is full of starry soloists, but Gardiner's team -- who have
mostly worked with him before -- were brilliant, individually and in
ensemble: Judith Howarth, the shining young soprano, the incomparable
mezzo Anne Sofie van Otter, and the flawless old (young) hands: tenor
Anthony Rolfe Johnson, weightless and floating, and the sonorous bass
Alastair Miles.

WE quite rightly care for people who are profoundly handicapped, sick
and infirm.
The need for such care is obvious but much less obvious is the need to
support those family members who carry the main burden of caring at
home.
Carers are everyday members of the community. They do their shopping
in local supermarkets, often hold down a job, and will have a chat with
friends and neighbours whom they meet casually while out shopping.
But as Carers they are invisible -- yet there are 700,000 of them in
Scotland.
They may care for:
* A newborn child who has severe disabilities;
* A loved one injured in a car accident or who has had a stroke;
* An ageing partner whose behaviour suddenly becomes bizarre;
* A partner who is no longer able to reciprocate your love and care.
Whatever form the caring takes it is a responsibility seldom shared by
others. Little practical help is given to ease the emotional, financial
and practical problems faced by carers.
The Princess Royal summed up the position of carers in our society
when four years ago she agreed to create a new Royal Trust -- The
Princess Royal Trust for Carers.
She said: ''In the course of my work I have often come into contact
with charities which help people who are sick and disabled. But what
about the people who care for the people who are sick and disabled --
the carers? They do not yet have a real identity, so they are often
overlooked and receive little support.''
One of the principal aims of the trust is to provide much needed
practical assistance for carers who without access to respite care or
other practical or emotional support may eventually find that they
cannot continue to perform their caring role.
The Princess Royal Trust for Carers has set a target of establishing
at least one centre for carers in each local authority area in the
United Kingdom.
The centres are the main vehicle of the trust's services to carers.
They provide:
* Information and advice on all issues affecting carers -- benefits,
respite and support services, aids and adaptations;
* Emotional support by providing opportunities for carers to share
their problems with volunteers and professional staff who understand
their situation, thus helping to alleviate isolation and stress;
* Carers centres may also offer help with shopping, transport or
laundry, and access to care attendance schemes or voluntary sitting
services.
In rural areas the centres may also provide mobile advice units and
home visiting.
The trust works in partnership with local authorities and other
statutory bodies, acting as a catalyst to provide the funds needed to
establish a centre which is managed by a local voluntary agency.
Normally for every #1 committed by the trust the statutory bodies
contribute #2. Funding is guaranteed for three years.
Since the trust was formed it has raised more than #5m throughout the
UK. In partnership with Scottish local authorities and health boards the
trust expects to have up to 20 centres established in Scotland by the
end of this year -- all managed by local voluntary agencies.
The cost of each centre varies but the trust often puts up #25,000
annually for three years in order to establish a new centre.
In Scotland there are already Princess Royal Trust Carer Centres in
Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Perth, Orkney, and the Borders. Others
will open soon in Falkirk, Stirling, Dundee, and Lanarkshire.
Raising money to fund carer centres is one of the trust's principal
aims. The other aim is to raise awareness so that there is a greater
understanding of the contribution carers make and of their need for
practical support.
Until recently there was little reference to carers in most documents
prepared by statutory authorities, but thankfully this has now changed.
Carers are beginning to be accepted as people with needs in their own
right.
Any of us could become a carer at any time.
Carers are the backbone of care in the community. They deserve our
recognition and support.
* Colin Williams is Director of Carer Support, The Princess Royal
Trust for Carers.

MARY BRENNAN bones up on a challenging piece of dance-theatre
THERE are a lot of personal challenges at work under the surface of
Clyde Unity's latest production, Bone. For choreographer/dancer Rosina
Bonsu there's the challenge of speaking lines. For playwright John
Binnie the challenge came in creating a script around a character who is
mute. And for the rest of the company -- actors Stephen Docherty and
Mari Binnie -- there was the prospect of learning not just lines but
choreography. So why make all these difficulties for one another?
In part, it's to do with Binnie's desire to keep Clyde Unity fresh and
forward looking, not merely resting on the formula of past successes.
A company-led community project in Drumchapel some 18 months ago
introduced him to Rosina Bonsu and alerted him to the strength of
movement-based theatre. John Binnie recalls: ''There were these kids
running about all over the place, and Rosina just spoke so quietly and
the next minute they're all going in the same direction. And everything
just came alive. It was wonderful.''
When he started playing about with ideas for Bone -- it's about the
interaction between a lonely, reclusive woman, a grieving widower and
the mute child (a boy) who comes into their lives -- it seemed logical
to make gestures be as significant as words. Enter Rosina, not just as
choreographer but as performer.
''Everyone assumes, of course, that as I'm the dancer, I'll be doing
the silent child,'' says a thoroughly tickled Bonsu: ''But I'm not. I'm
the woman.'' The little boy is, in fact, played by Mari Binnie. The day
I dropped in on rehearsals she was clambering over a rocky outcrop --
composed of bodies: Stephen Docherty's and Rosina Bonsu's to be exact.
Using people instead of inanimate scenery lends a curious uncertainty
to how she scrambles, where she places her feet, her hands. It makes it
look more natural than choreographed.
''Exactly'' chorused John Binnie and Bonsu at the same time . . . ''We
wanted it to look as if the movement was just growing out of the
action'', he continues: ''Not, 'here's a wee dance' and everything just
stops.'' No choreographed set pieces, then, but instead a use of
movement that has been encouraged by daily warm-up sessions before
rehearsals. ''They do body warm-ups with me, I do a voice warm-up with
them'', says Bonsu. ''I'm the director so I just sit back and watch!''
says  John Binnie.
Speaking on stage isn't completely new territory for Bonsu. She has
used text in some of her recent solo performances. But the crucial
difference lies in speaking someone else's words, taking on someone
else's character. ''At first I couldn't see anything about this woman
that I could identify with. But when we were talking about the play, and
what it meant, I found myself thinking, 'Yes. That could be me'''.
She cares passionately about her work, too passionately probably and
I can relate to that. Remembering lines? (She grins here.) ''It's not
like dancing, where if I forget a step I know how to cover myself. I
think we'll all know if I forget the lines.'' She breaks off, miming
panic, mouth open, making gagging noises, no words until she and John
Binnie collapse in fits of laughter. ''Och, Rosina'', he says, ''you
wanted a challenge.''
* Bone alternates with A Little Older at Theatre Workshop until
September 2.

In his bloody pursuit of an ethnically-segregated Greater Serbia where
''all Serbs shall live in one state'', Slobodan Milosevic is being
pursued by the outcome of his policy. Mladen Grbin, research associate
in the Institute of Russian and East European Studies, Glasgow
University, reports on the bitter fruits of a violent programme.
THE medium-sized industrial town of Tuzla in the North West part of
Bosnia Hercegovina, together with Sarajevo, are probably among the most
inaccessible places in the world.
The roads into Tuzla have for the last three years or so either been
cut off by besieging Bosnian Serb forces or washed away by the rains.
Only essential goods reach the population of some 700,000 of the
besieged area and, like the dirt tracks, the graves of the 71 young
people killed in the central square are fresh.
Tuzla Airport with the longest runway in former Yugoslavia has
recently received thousands of women in flight from Srebrenica and Zepa.
Encircled by razor wire, with UN soldiers standing guard, they are
scattered across the muddy fields surrounding the airport, and cry for
their menfolk who have been left behind, as they wash and dry the
clothes from the previous night's torrential rain, for the orderly rows
of tents are pegged straight into the muddy fields.
All anxiously await the announcements on the Tannoy with the
occasional name of a male returnee from the hell of Srebrenica.
Most refuse to leave the area so long as there is any hope of their
men returning.
Many however, will be waiting in vain and, according to a report by
the US State Department, there is evidence of mass graves of their
menfolk killed by Karadzic's Serbs with estimates of up to 3000 buried.
A further 12,000 are still missing.
Some who could not endure the waiting game ended the agony by hanging
themselves on the nearby trees.
In his bloody pursuit of an ethnically-segregated Greater Serbia where
''all Serbs shall live in one state'', Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia is
being pursued by the fruits of his policy which is now knocking hard on
his own door.
It all started in the latter part of 1990 with Croatian Serb
barricades in the Krajina region of Croatia and the forcible expulsion
of the Croatian minority in that area, and later it turned into
wholesale destruction of property, mass expulsions in the Baranja region
and Eastern Slavonia, where the city of Vukovar was devastated, and the
Croatian port of Dubrovnik with the whole hinterland of that ancient
city torched to ruins.
From there on to Bosnia Hercegovina, starting with the north eastern
region in the towns of Bjeljina, Zvornik, then further to the South to
Foca, Visegrad and westwards to Brcko, Derventa, Prijedor, Kljuc,
Bosanski Petrovac and many many others.
The method used was to let paramilitary groups, often led by the
infamous Zeljko Raznjatovic, to reign havoc on the civilian population
through murder, rape, and forcible removal, to prepare the ground for
the mopping up operation by the then Yugoslav National Army.
The self-fulfilling prophecy of Milosevic's vision has come home to
roost to his own brethren in Croatia in the recent military victory of
Croatian forces in the successful drive to reintegrate the territory
lost to the rebel Croatian Serbs.
Tens of thousands of civilians and soldiers, streamed out of the
Krajina region in long columns of tractors, cars, carts, laden with
possessions, heading for Bosnia Hercegovina and Serbia proper,
continuing the circle of misery and tragedy.
Despite the continually repeated assurances to the Croatian Serbs by
the Croatian government, only a handful chose to remain in their homes,
some indoctrinated by the propaganda of their own politicians, some in
genuine fear of reprisals, and some with guilty consciences, leaving
behind them their homes and devastation.
During some four years of self-rule, most of the non-Serb property has
been destroyed; churches either razed or desecrated, graveyards
bulldozed, individual graves ransacked.
In Otavica, the birthplace of the Croatian sculptor, Ivan Mestrovic --
one of the original 'Yugoslavs' -- the mausoleum in his honour and the
gallery were ransacked and his coffin opened up and looted.
Judging by what was left behind, there is a sense of an almost
temporary intention to remain.
Factories and industrial plants were also devastated, without which
the local population could not meaningfully think of their future there,
even if they succeeded in their attempt to secede from Croatia.
Some 160,000 of the victims in the newest bout of refugees are now
populating the town of Banja Luka in Bosnia Hercegovina, and are
beginning to settle in towns and villages in Serbia proper and the
former autonomous republics of Vojvodina and Kosovo, which is now
already triggering off another bout of 'ethnic cleansing' and enforced
migration, in this miserable, never-ending circle of suffering.
The document produced by the Serbian Academy of Arts and Sciences in
1986, called the ''Memorandum'', spelling out the necessity for a
homogeneous Serbia, and invoking the myth and legend of the history of
the Serbian people, implied a final solution to the Balkan problem, and
represented the foundation for an ethnically segregated arrangement for
the former Yugoslavia.
The tenets of the Memorandum were eagerly adopted by Slobodan
Milosevic, riding on a nationalist ticket in his pursuit of political
power in an attempt to harness and manufacture the goodwill of his
fellow-countrymen in the creation of the new state of Greater Serbia,
offering this new state to the international community to act as the
guardian of the gate to Europe.
However, instead of being a force of stability in the Balkans, this
faltering notion became unsustainable and the cause of monumental
instability in the middle of Europe, resulting in four million
displaced, more than 300,000 dead, and the potential for further mayhem.
Some 700 Croatian Serbs have been sent to Kosovo, a region of 90%
Albanians, administered by some 50,000 Serbian police through virtual
apartheid, where Albanians have no access to schooling, work or medical
care.
The attempt by Milosevic to repopulate Kosovo with the refugee Serbs
will further inflame an already tense situation, with the potential of
involving Albania proper and some 22% of the Albanians in the former
Yugoslav republic of Macedonia.
In the Machiavellian machinations of the strong man of the Balkans,
the latest refugees are becoming victims of the pursuit of power.
In his effort to legitimise his policy of territorial expansion,
Slobodan Milosevic has exposed his own people to a number of years of
sanctions, to pariah status and, finally, to the status of refugees.
One day, no doubt they will realise that all along their enemy was
within.

American envoys launched a new peace initiative for Bosnia on Tuesday
as separatist Serbs renewed their campaign of ''ethnic cleansing''.
US Assistant Secretary of State Richard Holbrooke met Croatian Foreign
Minister Mate Granic near the Adriatic port of Split and was due to hold
talks with Bosnian Foreign Minister Muhamed Sacirbey.
It was the first meeting between senior US officials and
representatives of the warring sides since Washington devised the new
peace plan after a crushing Croatian victory over Serb rebels last week
in the neighbouring republic of Croatia.
Washington has said the rout of the Croatian Serbs, which sent more
than 150,000 refugees streaming across ex-Yugoslavia, might present an
opportunity for settling the three-year war in Bosnia.
Holbrooke planned to meet Croatian President Franjo Tudjman on
Wednesday and was expected in Belgrade on Thursday for talks with
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic.
He was stopped by fog from landing in the Bosnian capital Sarajevo.
There were no immediate plans to meet Bosnian Serb leaders until they
showed a willingness to negotiate, US officials said.
The latest US proposals had won support from European allies but were
running into criticism already from Russia and Sarajevo.
Russia welcomed the new US efforts to settle the conflict but said
Washington's peace package contained a military element unacceptable to
Moscow.
In London, Bosnia's ambassador, Muhammad Filipovic, poured cold water
on the plan, saying it had no chance of success.
Warring factions are fighting again in central and southern Bosnia and
Bosnian Serbs have begun expelling Croats from their Banja Luka
stronghold.
Fighting appeared to slow in central Bosnia, with reports only of
small arms and machine-gun fire around Donji Vakuf. A major Bosnian army
offensive has been under way in the region.
Croatia threatened war against Serbs in Bosnia on Tuesday if they did
not stop bombarding the area around the historic Adriatic seaside town
of Dubrovnik.--Reuter

MORE women in Glasgow are contracting cervical cancer but the death

Greater Glasgow Health Board.
The board says that in 1993, the most recent year for which full data
is available, 89 women were registered as having cervical cancer
compared to 76 new cases the previous year. However, deaths from the
cancer in 1993 had gone down to 29 from 32 in 1992.

<TEXT>
RAILTRACK executives last night ordered an investigation to unearth
the mole who, for the second day in succession, had leaked sensitive
documents highlighting potentially dangerous shortfalls in the company's
safety procedures.
The original document had warned of another Clapham disaster and
yesterday's pointed to the need for an urgent review of safety policy in
11 key areas, including Railtrack's drugs and alcohol policy.
It questioned whether outside contractors were competent enough in
railway safety methods to be allowed loose on the network.
As the debate raged over safety, Railtrack executives ordered an
urgent review on how sensitive papers were distributed in future, in
addition to instigating the mole-hunt.
The Labour Party was revelling in the embarrassment the leaked
documents has caused both the Government and the company.
Deputy Leader John Prescott seized on them as a new weapon to attack
the Conservative Party's privatisation policy.
''We believe the Government has chosen the wrong priorities in
providing hundreds of millions of pounds to introduce privatisation,
rather than bring in safety improvements,'' he declared.
The growing revelations over lax safety could, he said, lead to the
collapse of its plans. The private sector would be reluctant to invest
in the railways with grave doubts now being raised on the safety issue.
The latest document leaked to the Labour Party makes intriguing
references to a former assistant project manager employed by Railtrack's
Major Products Department in Glasgow.
It also destroyed the company's attempt to dismiss the initial leak as
being merely the personal views of one manager, said Shadow Transport
Minister Henry McLeish.
''Today's report shows the depth of the disarray in Railtrack.
''Project managers operated without full knowledge of the safety
rules, Railtrack is unsure of who is even in charge of private
contractors working on the line, and no-one knows whether Raitrack is
employing competent safety staff,'' he said.
''We are now seeing a shambles within Railtrack. Control is vague and
responsibility is confused.''
Before issuing copies of the second leaked documents to the press,
Labour Party officials had carefully obliterated the name of a project
manager employed by contractors Alistair Graham Associates.
Mr McLeish said the individual's name had been deleted for reasons of
confidentiality.
The Herald has since identified the person involved as Mr Archie
Burleigh.
Mr McLeish declined to elaborate on a paragraph in the report which
said Mr Burleigh had previously worked for Railtrack's Major Products
Division in Glasgow.
The paragraph concluded: ''The circumstances surrounding his departure
from Glasgow are not clear (officially).''
The important message had nothing to do with individuals, Mr McLeish
said. It was to do with overall safety on the rail network.
The memo followed an investigation into a relatively minor incident at
Hitchen, in May last year, when an empty train brought down an overhead
line.
It said that, at the time of the incident, the precise relationship
between Railtrack and outside agencies was neither clear nor available.
''This area of doubt would become a significant and embarrassing issue
in the event of a major rail accident if railway operational matters, or
negligence on the part of agency personnel, caused or contributed to,
the accident,'' the report declares.
''Also, any lack of competence on the part of agency personnel
prevents Railtrack from complying with its Railway Safety Case.''
Among the 11 matters requiring urgent attention was the legal
relationship between Railtrack and agencies, and the competence in
railway operational safety of personnel provided by agencies.
Conservative Party chairman Dr Brian Mawhinney, who until five weeks
ago was Secretary of State for Transport, dismissed the Labour Party's
views as scaremongering.
''The safety regime for British Rail was put in place in 1988,'' he
said. ''Since then, people have worked to improve that safety record and
I believe, as recently as yesterday, Railtrack reassured Ministers, yet
again, that safety was paramount.''
The report leaked to the Labour Party was an indication of just how
seriously Railtrack was concerned about safety.
It was a point adopted by Mr Gil Howarth, Railtrack's major projects
division director. He told BBC radio news that the latest leaked
document was quite rightly a review of an incident that happened in May
last year.

HOPEFULLY there are many thoughtful people who do not belong to a
particular political party but who have a strong belief in democracy and
who are concerned with a system which produces 16 years of single-party
rule. The emergence yet again of the death-wish of some Labour
politicians is a depressing sign of the shortsighted nature of political
dogmatism.
With respect to the smaller parties it is apparent that there are two
main blocks of voters who cannot be persuaded to change their allegiance
from right or left and in order to break the current run of victories
which the Tories have enjoyed it is essential for Labour to convince the
centre ground that they have both the ability and the stature to govern.
Under the late John Smith they almost achieved this and with his
tragic death and the succession of Tony Blair at last their time
appeared to have arrived. It is a fact of British politics that the
votes of the uncommitted put in the winning party.
How sad it is then to hear the voices of dissent before there is
anything to argue about. Whatever ideals these objectors may hold they
are wasting their energy without the reality of power.
Whatever they may think of Tony Blair as their leader he has the
respect and the regard of the middle ground and will lead them into a
fairer and more caring society than could ever be achieved by a
right-wing government exhausted by its years in office and emasculated
by 11 years under the leadership of Margaret Thatcher.

A COUPON collector is due to stand trial on a charge of depriving a
pools syndicate of a #2.3m jackpot.
The case of Mr Cameron Baxter, 27, has been set down for the sitting
at the High Court in Edinburgh which begins on September 4.
It is alleged that Mr Baxter, of Wallace Street, Stirling, formed a
fraudulent scheme to obtain football pools stake money and to
appropriate it to his own use.
The Crown claims that, in pursuance of the alleged scheme, while
acting as a pools collector between July 24 and September 10 last year,
Mr Baxter pretended to various people in Stirling that he would forward
pools coupons and stake money on their behalf.
The coupons and stake money are said to have related to football
matches played between August 6 and September 10 last year.
The indictment against Mr Baxter states that he induced people to hand
over completed coupons and stake money totalling #242, embezzled the
cash, and failed to deliver the stakes and coupons to Littlewoods.
The result, according to the charge, was that he deprived Gordon
Turner, John Ferguson, Donald McVean, Richard Syme, and Owen Kelly of
winning #2,318,311 for matches played on September 10 for which they had
filled in a coupon.
The Crown has cited 22 witnesses.

THE fact that I am able to write these few lines can be directly
connected to the dropping of the atomic bombs on Japan.
I would ask everyone who disapproves to put themselves in my shoes --
just one of the many thousands of soldiers who had the journey to the
East cancelled after the bombs were dropped.
I was called up in 1941 and survived the journey from Alamein via
North Africa, Sicily, and the D-Day landings in France, then through
Belgium, Holland and Germany in the 73rd Anti-Tank Regiment attached to
30 Corps HQ.
Following VE Day, the preparations for the long journey East began
when I was sent back to Scarborough on a drill and duty course on jungle
warfare training, which led to promotion.
On my return to Germany, all my surviving colleagues had disappeared
-- they were on their way to the Far East and eventually reached Cairo
en route, for the second time since the call-up in 1941.
The sense of relief, for them and for me, when our travels were
cancelled was overwhelming to say the least.
Let there be no doubt that thousands, perhaps millions, of lives,
including mine, were saved when the bombs dropped, and in conclusion may
I remind those of you without warfare experience that self-preservation
and bravery are inseparable.

ACCORDING to your political reporters the Campaign for Socialism are
Labour's ''traditionalists'' (August 11). This is a description so at
odds with reality as to be Orwellian Newspeak. ''Traditionalist'' is a
strange way to describe a group aiming to equip Labour with radical
policies to move society forward.
A more flattering but equally misleading Newspeak term is also applied
to the Labour leadership -- they are ''modernisers.'' This despite Tony
Blair declaring in a speech to Rupert Murdoch that Labour is ''the
free-trade party''. This nineteenth century liberalism sounds more
''traditionalist'' than any policy being suggested by the left of the
party.
In fact the terms ''moderniser'' and ''traditionalist'' do not
describe political views inside the Labour Party. They are merely
insults which Originate from New Labour's New Right and are designed to
give a progressive gloss to their abandonment of socialist ideas.
Political journalists do their readers no favours by endorsing such
patronising and misleading labels.

RUTH Wishart complains about the lack of awareness of the devolution
debate among people in England (August 14).
Devolution is a Labour Party policy -- indeed it is said to be one of
their flagship policies. The responsibility, therefore, for stimulating
debate about Scottish devolution in England surely lies with the Labour
Party and in particular with the Scottish Labour MPs.
It also lies with pelple like Ruth Wishart herself who, as a committed
devolutionist and a respected journalist, must know how to get the
message across.
That all these people have had some years to stimulate this debate and
yet have signally failed leads me to wonder whether this is due to
incompetence or laziness, or is it because those who espouse devolution
have yet to be convinced themselves that it will really work and not
lead to the break-up of the Union.
Whatever the answer, is it not reasonable to deduce that, for the
Labour Party, devolution is just a policy to use in Scotland to fend off
the SNP and in reality their heart is not in it?

AS a former POW of the Japanese in South-east Asia who toiled on the
Burma railway I write simply to disassociate myself from the demands for
apology and claims for compensation from Japan by many of its former
PoWs.
It speaks ill for once-great Britain that today it is saying of
yesterday ''It wasn't fair'' while ignoring claims from our imperial
past from peoples marginalised and worse in their own native lands --
such as Maoris in New Zealand from whom the Treaty of Waitangi still
rankles, and Australia's Aborigines.
In life, I was told at my mother's knee, we lie upon ''the bed that we
make for ourselves'' and in the Far East that we did not make our bed
sufficiently well has not been the fault of our erstwhile foe -- an
enemy that, whatever other traits he may have had, proved himself in our
own jargon to be ''a bonny fighter'' as those who fought their way back
through Burma from Kohima, and our American Allies who took Okinawa and
hardly a prisoner in the taking of it will testify.
In Malaya and Singapore, unhappily, British troops without battle
experience found themselves up against battle-hardened troops to whom
the whole idea of surrender was anathema, and were bewildered and
outwitted, not because individual soldiers lacked courage but because
real leadership from Malayan Command was almost entirely absent.

A MAN picked up his four-year-old daughter to carry her on his
shoulders and lifted her into the still-revolving blades of his
helicopter, an inquest heard yesterday.
Businessman Nicholas Hawkings-Byass told the inquest into the girl's
death that the tragedy happened minutes after he landed the two-seater
helicopter at his family's weekend home in the Cotswolds.
Bristol coroner Paul Forrest recorded a verdict of accidental death on
the girl, Lydia. She died of head injuries.
Mr Hawkings-Byass, who was not at the hearing, said in a statement
read to the inquest that he landed and switched off the engine.
He went through the routine procedures for closing down the engine,
and as he collected his briefcase and business papers his daughter, who
had already been on a short flight with him, approached him and asked
him to carry her.
Mr Hawkings-Byass, 41, of Tregunter Road, Chelsea, west London, said
in his statement: ''I put my briefcase down to pick her up with both
hands to put her on my shoulders.
''What happened next is not totally clear. I am not sure if I got her
on to my shoulders. She then fell forwards on to the ground and, as she
lay there, the colour drained from her cheeks.
''I did not feel any impact, although I realised something awful had
happened.
''I was facing away from the helicopter. I was not aware of the rotors
revolving. There was no wind noise.''
He and Lydia were facing away from the helicopter, and were about six
feet from the fuselage.
He called to his wife, Clare, for help, and together they drove Lydia
to hospital at Bourton-on-the-Water. She was later transferred to
hospital in Cheltenham, where she died three days later on July 2.
No members of Mr Hawkings-Byass's family were at the hearing, which
consisted largely of witness statements read by a coroner's officer.
Mr Hawkings-Byass, managing director of NBH Ltd, an agriculture
aviation firm based in London, said in his statement that he had been a
qualified helicoptor pilot for seven years.
He had flown to his Cotswold home from Luton Airport.

Of the 1st Battalion Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) who landed in
Rangoon the day Singapore fell (imagine the morale), 28 were taken
prisoner and were in Rangoon jail until liberated in May 1945.
Twenty-seven survived, which says a lot for the Scottish character in
face of adversity.
The one who perished, Rifleman Cross, died as a result of an accident

IN an excellent article extolling the achievements of British
scientists in their contribution to the war effort, Sir Samuel Curran
detailed their skills in inventing some of the most advanced scientific
techniques (August 10).
By contrast he remarked on very simple devices which also proved
effective. One such was the coil carrying an electric current fitted to
ships, producing an opposing magnetic field which largely neutralised
the vertical field of the ship.
At the start of the war the menace of the German magnetic mine was
very real, ships being sunk in large numbers. However, the mechanism of
the mine was unknown.
By good fortune one was dropped, not as intended in the sea, but on
the mudflats at the mouth of the Thames estuary.
Two naval officers volunteered to dismantle it. They did so, step by
step, knowing that each subsequent step might mean certain death, but
they succeeded, and because of their effort it was revealed that the
mine was actuated by a vertical magnetic field.
Hence the simple expedient of fitting ships with the ''degaussing''
coil was put into practice.
Scientists played a magnificent role in the war, but the heroic action
of these two officers defeated the menace of the German mine -- once
mooted as Hitler's secret weapon.

I HAVE just spent a few days driving around the north of our country,
exploring the vast area above Inverness for the first time. Of course,
the weather was very kind to us, and that helped, but the scenery and
the welcome we enjoyed are unforgettable.
At every town where we chose to stay overnight, we called at the local
tourist information office and within minutes we were fixed-up with
superb accommodation: so simple, so friendly, and so efficient.
However, I noticed that in all the tourist offices I visited our
friends from Europe were expected to communicate in English since there
was obviously no-one who could converse in German, French, Spanish,
Italian, or whatever, despite the fact that, from what I saw, a great
number of non-English speakers turned to the local tourist office for
help.
It seemed to me that some knowledge of German or Italian was more
vital than a knowledge of English.
We stayed in a hotel in Thurso and the barmaid made a very telling
remark: people from Glasgow and Edinburgh think Inverness is the north,
but Germans, French, and Italians know that's not true.

SCOTLAND'S largest industry-wide promotion aimed at bringing visitors
north of the Border this autumn was launched nationwide yesterday.
The Autumn Gold initiative, which involves more than 500 businesses,
aims to increase late-season tourism by up to 7%, generating more than
#5m of income for the Scottish economy in its first year.
Mr Ian Grant, the Scottish Tourist Board chairman, was in London to
announce details of the initiative, which is aimed at stay-at-home Scots
as well as people in the south.
At the recently opened Stakis Edinburgh Airport Hotel, his colleague,
Mr Gordon Adams, director of planning and development, said it was a
great step forward.
Mr Adams said the campaign was a direct result of the national tourism
strategy launched last year, and added: ''There has not been as good
collaboration in the past as there might have been between the public
and private sectors.''
He said the Autumn Gold campaign, in which more tourist attractions
than ever will be open, fulfilled two objectives -- ''seasonability and
collaboration''.
A total of #1.25m is to be spent on promoting the campaign, including
leaflets and television and cinema advertisements.
The promotion gives discounts on air and rail travel, special car hire
rates, special offers on accommodation, deals on visitor attractions,
and special offers on Scottish crafts and giftware.
Autumn Gold offers will be valid from September 29 to November 30 and
a number -- 0345 511411 -- has been set up for people to order their
free Autumn Goldcard.
For those who are not convinced, little-known autumnal facts are
provided:
* Average rainfall in Edinburgh in October and November is
consistently lower than in July and August.
* Lerwick, Shetland, will have seven minutes more daylight than London
on October 1.
* Visitors will find agapanthus and watsonias, flowers native to South
Africa, in bloom in the West Highlands.

TAX incentives for film makers to capitalise on the current spate of
Scottish blockbusters were demanded by the SNP yesterday.
At the launch of a party fact-finding initiative, arts and
broadcasting spokesperson Ms Roseanna Cunningham warned that unless tax
relief schemes are offered to the industry, big budget productions will
desert Scotland, causing ''real jobs and revenue'' to be lost.
The launch highlighted Braveheart, opening in the UK on September 8.
Shot initially in Scotland, the film relocated mid-production to
Ireland, which offers substantial tax breaks for film production.
Ms Cunningham said: ''Despite its Scottish subject and the great
enthusiasm for Scotland among its production team, substantial parts of
the production were based in Ireland.
''The reason for that was purely financial but it was the Irish film
industry that reaped the profit and the benefit of additional work and
training.''
Following the introduction of tax incentives in Ireland in June 1993,
the total Irish film budget increased by more than 400% to #47.1m over a
twelve-month period.
In 1994, filming brought Scotland a record #22.9m in direct spending
due to titles such as Rob Roy, Braveheart, and Mary Riley.
However, Ms Cunningham said Scottish film workers remained in ''a
variable and insecure environment''.
She added: ''We are not just talking about artists but ordinary people
in bread and butter supporting industries such as technicians and
hoteliers.''
SNP chief executive Michael Russell said current UK film policy was
geared towards supporting Pinewood, Shepperton, and Ealing in the south
of England.
The SNP consultation will involve gathering opinion from the industry
and attempting to quantify the number of workers involved in film and
spin-off industries.
However, the Scottish Film Production Fund, while welcoming the
proposal of tax breaks, said the decision to relocate Braveheart
mid-production had been one of planning and not finance.

WE returned from dining out to find two fire engines parked beside wet
pavements in front of our hotel in London. A motley throng of foreigners
was assembled outside a hotel two doors away and chefs and kitchen staff
covered the pavement between.
No concern of ours, we thought, and made for our hotel front door only
to find it locked and the building in darkness. It was Bailey's Hotel
that had been on fire and their guests were being directed to the
Gloucester Hotel next door.
Chaos could have followed, but it didn't. Both hotels were prepared to
cope with such an emergency. It was found that the fire which had
started in the kitchen had only burnt the ground floor, with some smoke
and water damage to the first and second.
We were assembled in the Gloucester Hotel's large foyer where free
drinks and sandwiches were served and announcements made. A babel of
excited voices vied for attention in English, German, Spanish, and
Japanese but the manager made himself heard.
As the five floors of Bailey's Hotel were to be cleared one at a time
the management assembled all guests with rooms on the first floor. Staff
with torches helped guests up the darkened staircase and into their
rooms to pack their belongings, then helped them out of the hotel with
their luggage. Interpreters helped the foreigners overcome any
confusion.
Clearing all five floors took some time and as we waited we shared
settees and sympathy and communicated by sign language and the few
foreign words we knew.
All the Bailey Hotel's guests were suitably housed in the Gloucester,
Forum, or Forte hotels by the early hours of the morning.
From start to finish the management of all the hotels involved acted
with streamlined efficiency, and gave every possible assistance to their
multi-lingual guests. It was a good example of the legendary British
sang-froid when faced with an emergency.

COMMON Spotted Orchid lives up to its name. It has spotted leaves and
is common. It is one of the most abundant orchids in Britain and in the
Glasgow area it grows in 76 out of 90 of the 4km squares (see Wild
Plants of Glasgow, Mercat Press, 1992).
It colonises a great variety of habitats including bings of both coal
and lime, disused railways and other undisturbed waste ground, roadsides
including motorway embankments, gardens, pasture, and marshy ground.
There is no surprise whatever that it colonised a roundabout at
Linwood (August 11). It is a pity it was obliterated there but its
weediness will ensure that it will invade other sites.
The picture you publish does not show this ''very rare'' species. It
does not show any orchid but Marsh Woundwort, a common member of the
Labiatae (Mint family).
Coralroot Orchid (not Coalroot Orchid) currently has 65 sites in
Britain and not merely two as you reported.
It is right that many orchids need to be conserved. No fewer than six
out of 15 species of orchid have gone extinct in the Glagow area in the
last 200 years because of habitat destruction.
However, Common Spotted Orchid is one of the most resilient.
Conservationists ultimately risk doing their just cause harm by
promulgating misleading, inaccurate information.

I READ with interest John McMillan's letter regarding parakeets seen
in the Newlands area of Glasgow recently (August 11). Curiously, the
RSPB regional office in Glasgow has received quite a number of calls
regarding sightings of parakeets, mainly from the South Side of Glasgow
and Newton Mearns.
The sightings were of single birds, not a pair.
The birds are more likely to be escapees from a captive environment
rather than wild birds venturing further north.
From the description given, the birds are probably not the ring-necked
parakeets which escaped from captivity and are now surviving and
breeding in the wild around the London area.
It is very unlikely that Newlands parakeets will be able to breed this
far north; however with such glorious weather, who knows!
Parakeets are omnivorous and would be able to survive quite happily on
a diet of seeds, fruit, and the odd insect (I wonder if they're fond of
midges).

WHEN I was a lad I served a term for the Government Economic Service
in its northern-most outpost, the economic and statistic section of the
Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland.DAFS was located in
Chesser House, a building later to fall on hard times as Lothian
region's chief collection point for the poll tax.
Apart from devising a new forecasting technique for the Scottish sheep
flock by counting the number of 23 buses lumbering up Gorgie Road in any
half-hour period, I remember my spell in DAFS for giving me a first
opportunity to contribute to an HMSO publication. This was an estimable
and serious journal entitled Scottish Agricultural Economics. It was
published annually and well received by a dedicated student readership
in the agricultural colleges who saw within its pages useful information
to short-circuit their theory exams.
As a young economist I was somewhat in awe of this official digest
although sensible enough to realise that the rest of Scotland was not
necessarily queuing at the bookshops awaiting publication of Scottish
Agricultural Economics.
Government publications have changed somewhat over the intervening 15
years. The covers are glossier, the contents lighter and perhaps less
reliable. However, in the normal course of events publications such as
Social Trends or the Employment Gazette don't hold up too many front
pages.
Even in the silly season there are usually better news stories about.
Admittedly there might be the occasional tabloid flutter when Social
Trends finds that Scots actually drink less than the English or that
some quiet unsuspecting town has the highest illegitimacy rate in the
country.
However, the Employment Gazette normally has its thunder stolen by the
monthly jobs figures and is consulted rather than reported. Therefore it
took some nifty work by The Herald news desk to generate genuine
front-page news from last week's Gazette.
The article in question concerned projections of economic activity
rates across the nations and regions of the United Kingdom for the next
decade as well as some comparisons over the past 10 years.
The results make pretty dismal reading for Scotland. First the
retrospective analysis indicates that Scottish economic performance has
not been what it was cracked up to be.
In the years 1984-94 the Government statisticians found that the
growth in numbers of the labour force economically active in Scotland
was a full point behind the UK average of 4.6%.
Nothing too much to worry about there except when you remember that
these were the years when the growth in oil and gas output might have
been expected to power the Scottish economy forward to a new and higher
plain of activity.
In addition, this was a period which saw the Scottish unemployment
rate dip below that of the UK average for the first time in living
memory. What the Employment Gazette tells us is that this happened
because the number of available workers was lower not because economic
activity rates were higher.
However, it is the projections for the next 10 years which should
really set alarm bells ringing. Here the Scottish figures stand out like
a sore thumb by showing a modest decline while the UK average is set to
rise by a projected 6%.
No other region or nation is showing the same trend as Scotland while
East Anglia is forecast to spurt forward by a full 13%. In contrast, the
Government's own statisticians picture Scotland as an area of stagnant
economic activity.
Now, of course, there are cautionary notes to be made about such
projections. They are largely population-based and the Scottish
forecasts come from a different source than those for England and Wales.
They will also assume a constant policy framework throughout the
forecast period.
However, the fact that Scottish population growth continues to lag
behind the rest of the UK is, in itself, a symptom of relative economic
decline.
To argue therefore, as the Scottish Office Junior Minister Raymond
Robertson seemed to, that we should take no notice whatsoever of these
findings, is to raise complacency to an art form.
The Scottish economy has some massive strengths compared to the rest
of the UK. We have a better mix of industry, a higher rate of
productivity, and a much stronger export performance. We have both
natural and comparative advantages which other countries would give
their eye teeth for.
However, it is foolish to believe that we have been punching anything
near our economic weight within the straitjacket set by Westminster
rule. Since 1979 the overall Scottish growth rate has been a tad below
2%, identical to the UK average and simply pathetic by international
standards.
If the Employment Gazette is anything like correct, the next 10 years
might well be rougher with a long, slow relative decline chilling the
economic marrow of the nation.
When the Unionist parties warn of the supposed dire consequences of
Scottish independence, they omit to mention what will happen if we are
foolish enough to leave things as they are. Perhaps the Employment
Gazette has given us a clue about the economic consequences of the
Union.
The Scotland which is forecast is a stagnant land which will miss
every economic opportunity, duck every political challenge, until
finally there is nothing much left but shame to gnaw.

A MAJOR advance in the detection of the bone disease osteoporosis is
now available in Scotland -- where it was discovered several years ago
by scientists at Rowett Research Institute, Aberdeen.
The test, which could make global screening of women feasible, has
been developed by an American company because of an initial lack of
interest in Britain.
The simple and cheap urine test will pinpoint those likely to suffer
from the disease, which affects 40% of women aged more than 50, and
could allow action to be taken to prevent the condition developing in
likely victims.
Osteoporosis mainly affects post-menopausal women and in sufferers the
structure of the bones becomes more fragile and prone to damage. Minor
injuries can cause bone fractures and the spine can be compressed
leading to a loss of height and eventually considerable pain.
The test costs #10 but demand and new technology is expected to cause
a price drop.
The Rowett holds the patent for the new assay method and it could
bring considerable revenue to the institute to help fund further
research.
Dr Simon Robins, head of the bone research group at the Rowett, said
the basic research was conducted 12 years ago when osteoporosis was not
on the agenda.
Their research into bone biochemistry to determine what gave bones
their strength revealed substances in bones which were not present
anywhere else and could provide good ''markers'' for testing.
The results of their work were published and the researchers went
around numerous British companies trying to persuade them to invest in
further research for the test.
''Sadly it was the same old story and no-one in Britain seemed
prepared to take the risk,'' said Dr Simon Robins, who made the
discovery.
However, a venture capital group in California saw details of their
work and the test has been developed by Metra Biosystems Inc of Mountain
View, California.
Dr Robins said a biochemical test developed in Denmark had recently
been highlighted on television but the Scottish test had the advantage
of being more specific.
Professor Philip James, director of the Rowett, said: ''Because it can
affect more than one third of women, osteoporosis is a major area for
international research at the moment.
''In economic terms, the effects of the disease cause a major drain on
the NHS resources in Britain but, even more importantly, it can have
major personal consequences for patients and their families. Obviously
we are delighted that such a significant step forward has come from
basic research at the Rowett Institute.''
Dr Robins said the Scottish researchers were now working on possible
treatment methods which would be more specific and would avoid the side
effects of hormone replacement therapy.
He said such a treatment was still a few years off.

NEIGHBOURS on Mull have pleaded with a court to treat two middle-aged
brothers with leniency, after they admitted growing cannabis.
The High Court in Glasgow yesterday heard that Robert MacGillivray,
45, had 105 plants in a makeshift greenhouse made of car windscreens and
another 17 plants in his garden.
Over the hill, his brother Kenneth, 41, had 17 of the plants in his
walled garden.
The brothers, of Airds Croft, Pennyghael, have admitted producing
cannabis between January and July last year and Robert has admitted
possessing the drug with intent to supply it.
The court heard Robert used cannabis for health reasons and gave away
the surplus to friends.
His counsel, Mr Ian Sharpe, handed the judge a letter from islanders
asking for leniency.
Robert was highly regarded by the local community and his caravan door
was always open to his friends, Mr Sharpe said.
Mrs Fiona Reith, prosecuting, said a tip-off sent police after the
brothers on July 14.
Mr George Gebbie, for Kenneth, said that although the brothers'
caravans were separated by a hill, they seldom saw each other.
''Kenneth has a different life style and lives like a hermit,'' he
said.
Mr Gebbie said the plants were for Kenneth's own use and there was no
suggestion that anyone else received any.
Lord Cowie continued the case to the High Court in Edinburgh on
September 5 for reports. He also continued bail.

COLIN Stagg, the man cleared of murdering Rachel Nickell, married his
''angel from above'' yesterday -- then rushed home to watch Batman.
Almost a year after he was acquitted of the Wimbledon Common killing,
Mr Stagg tied the knot with 26-year-old care worker Diane Beddoes, who
started writing to him while he was in jail awaiting trial.
His best man and childhood friend Dave Butler, 30, from Twickenham,
south-west London, said: ''It meant a lot to him because no-one was on
his side. Everybody thought that he had done it. For someone to befriend
you when you're a man who's innocent was just like an angel from above
coming down.
''I think he deserves everything he gets because he's been through a
lot of hell. I just wish both of them a lot of happiness.''
Miss Beddoes, dressed in a flowing two-piece ivory dress, with a
silver medallion on a blue ribbon round her neck, said: ''I'm madly in
love and very happy.''
Lee Ashley, a friend who lives near their flat in Roehampton,
south-west London, said: ''Colin's not got a nerve in sight. I was with
him at seven in the morning. He was sitting in his shorts watching the
funnies on TV.''
Miss Beddoes added: ''He wants to get home for Batman.''
However, Mr Stagg, in an open-necked white shirt, dark waistcoat and
trousers, was less forthcoming.
Smiling as he led his bride through a barrage of photographers after
the register office ceremony in Wandsworth, he answered questions
tersely -- yes, it was the happiest day of his life and no, they had no
plans for a honeymoon or children at the moment.
Before the ceremony, Mr Stagg, 31, and his bride sat with their arms
around each other, joking with guests, while a parks police officer
guarded the waiting room door.
Despite Mr Stagg's acquittal, the murder of 23-year-old Rachel
Nickell, who was stabbed to death in front of her young son in July
1992, has haunted the couple's life together.
They were arrested on the common, a short walk from their south west
London home, in January this year after a fight with a man who was out
walking his dog.
Miss Beddoes admitted possessing a cosh which she used when her fiance
appeared to be to be getting the worst of the fight and Mr Stagg
admitted threatening the man with an axe.
Miss Beddoes received a six-month conditional discharge and Mr Stagg
was put on probation for 12 months.

SO far so good. When the Scottish Office announced partnership schemes
in four of Scotland's most deprived areas seven years ago the response
was cautious and coloured by the fact that the local authorities
involved were hardly on speaking terms with Government officials in
Edinburgh. Nor was there much enthusiasm over the framework set down for
the scheme, and particularly what was regarded as over-optimism about
the possibilities for co-operation between private and public bodies.
Many of these worries have been resolved at least partly, and an
interim report on the degree of regeneration within the four areas
reports successes in some respects. Partnership schemes were intended to
improve sectors such as housing and amenities, environment and image,
but also  to attack the problem of long-term unemployment. Much of the
housing stock in the chosen areas has been improved. This effect has
been enhanced by better amenities such as the long-awaited new shopping
centre in Castlemilk. For these and other reasons the image of the four
housing estates has been raised and, as the Scottish Office rightly
pointed out yesterday, the proportion of people happy to live in them
has risen and the proportion wishing to leave has fallen.   These are
excellent achievements and should not be underrated. They have been
possible because the private sector has been willing to be involved
positively in housing schemes and also, and perhaps more importantly,
because the local communities have been at the centre of matters, have
been listened to, and have been enabled to get on with much of the work
themselves. The researchers who compiled the interim report are surely
right when they say that getting so many organisations to work together
was an achievement in itself and that the benefits which have resulted
would not have come otherwise. Nevertheless, it would be wrong to ignore
the fact that evidence on the intractable problem of unemployment in the
four areas does not give a clear picture or much reason for hope.
Overall employment did not improve, and in the Whitfield estate in
Dundee the improvement could be ascribed to new owner-occupiers. The
simple fact is that tackling deep-seated unemployment requires
considerable financial investment and that, as the researchers found,
the cost is consistently underestimated. Partnership schemes are clearly
worthwhile and should be extended, but realistic financial support must
also be in place.

POLICE yesterday dismissed a claim by Sinn Fein that an SAS undercover
unit could have shot dead ramblers Peter and Gwenda Dixon, whose brutal
murders six years ago are still unsolved.
The couple's bodies were found on the isolated Pembrokeshire coastal
footpath in West Wales, in the same area where a big IRA arms cache was
hidden.
Although detectives believe robbery was the most likely motive, a
terrorist link has never been ruled out.
Speculation was revived on Monday after Sinn Fein's Belfast office
issued a statement in response to fresh inquiries by a newspaper.
A party official suggested that the Dixons may have been shot by
mistake by soldiers lying in wait for an IRA unit to pick up buried
weapons and explosives.
However, Dyfed-Powys police, who are still searching for the killer,
said not a single piece of evidence had been found to support such an
allegation.
''We would point out that the arms cache was not found until some four
months after the murders of Mr and Mrs Dixon,'' said a spokesman. ''The
file has never closed on this case and we still want to hear from anyone
with information.''
Since the clifftop killings at Little Haven, Dyfed, in June 1989,
Welsh detectives have liaised several times with RUC colleagues on
possible IRA connections.
Two IRA terrorists were arrested in December that year after they
attempted to remove buried explosives at Newgale, two miles from the
scene.
Although questioned about the Dixons' deaths, Damien McComb and Liam
O'Dhuibhir, now serving 30 year sentences for terrorism, were never
linked to the murders.
Mr Peter Dixon, 51, a businessman and former RAF officer, and his wife
Gwenda, 52, a secretary, were blasted at close range with a shotgun.
The couple, from Witney, Oxfordshire, had visited the Pembrokeshire
National Park every summer for 15 years to walk and watch birds.
A piece of fishing rope was used to tie Mr Dixon's hands behind his
back before he was shot in the face.
His wife was killed a few feet away and was probably near the edge of
cliffs when she was shot.
The bodies were then dragged behind a carefully made screen of bracken
and roots. The murder weapon was never found.
Detectives are still searching for their key suspect -- a scruffy
cyclist in shorts who they believe used Mr Dixon's bank card to withdraw
#300 from cash machines at three local banks.
Although an IRA or drugs smuggling link has never been ruled out,
senior officers remain convinced the couple were victims of a callous
and calculating armed robber who singled them out as they reached the
only secluded wooded area of that section of footpath.

BBC2 Controller Michael Jackson last night defended a #66m autumn
schedule featuring programmes which include violence, bad language, and
drug taking.
''This is drama that reflects modern life in the 1990s and I am very
proud of it,'' Mr Jackson said.
One production is Loved Up, a sensual drama starring Lena Headey, in
which she falls in love with actor Ian Hart and joins his night-time
world.
Screen Two dramas include Jimmy McGovern's award winning Priest, a
vivid, uncompromising journey into the soul of a tortured Catholic
priest.
The Performance series of studio drama features Zoe Wanamaker, Colin
Firth, and Stephen Dillane, in D H Lawrence's The Widowing of Mrs
Holroyd, exploring life in a mining community in 1914.
Factual programmes include My Secret Life, in which people describe
episodes of wife swapping and a gay priest talks about the pressures of
living a double life, and End of Innocence, which describes the onset of
the Aids epidemic.
Mr Jackson said: ''We are the only terrestrial channel to have
increased our viewer share and we are now equal with Channel 4.
''We are more accessible and the channel is working very well, with
72% of the population watching something on BBC2 each week.
''This is the channel which screened Middlemarch and Martin Chuzzlewit
and if we also screen drama which reflects modern life then I am very
proud of that.''
Comedy and light entertainment also feature in the 500 hours of new
programming, which Mr Jackson called a schedule of ''innovation and
breadth''.
Many stars are involved in the BBC2 launch, which includes many
one-off dramas to be screened on Saturday nights, featuring such as John
Hurt, Alfred Molina, Tom Wilkinson, Cathy Tyson, and Helen Mirren.
Mr Jackson said the Saturday night dramas, which feature writers of
the calibre of Jimmy McGovern, Howard Schuman, and Harold Pinter,
''emphasised BBC2's commitment to the single drama''.
The new schedule also includes comedy from Steve Coogan, Mrs Merton,
and Vic and Bob.

THE Scottish Office will consider any plea for extra resources for the
hard-pressed Highland and Islands Fire Brigade, which has spent the past
two-and-a-half weeks tackling one moorland fire south of Inverness which
the local fire chief believes will only be completely extinguished by
heavy snow.
The Environment Minister, Lord Lindsay, made this commitment yesterday
as he visited the scene of the fire near Daviot which has spread over an
area of 15 square miles, with peat burning to a depth of six feet and up
to #60,000 worth of trees destroyed.
It has already cost Highland Fire Brigade around #36,000, although the
landowners are having to bear the #700-an-hour costs of using
helicopters.
The Army has been alerted that the brigade might not be able to cope
if there were other forest fires as the good weather continues in the
Highlands. It is already making an all-terrain vehicle available to the
Highland brigade.
Lord Lindsay praised the efforts of the firefighters so far and said
that, in the first instance, the claim on resources would go to the
local fire authority then to its constituent authorities.
He added: ''When the fire services are resourced, the contingency is
always there for the unexpected but what is not known is to what extent
the unexpected is going to use resources.
''That is why there is a procedure for the local authorities to
approach the Scottish Office with an application and if such an
application was made we would consider it very carefully.''
The Minister would not speculate on how favourably the Government
would look on such an application, stressing instead that the immediate
priority was to get the fire out. The question of resources could be
examined later, he said.
Firemaster Robert Gordon said: ''I am serious that it will take a good
snowfall to finish this fire. Forty-eight hours of heavy rain would
certainly help but it looks as though there's going to be more hot
weather and wind. That is the problem. Every time we get it dampened
down, the wind fans it up again.''
Mr Gordon said the cost to the brigade was largely because of the
nature of its staffing.
''There is only one full-time station in the Highlands, at Inverness,
with 70 full-time staff. There are another 400 retained personnel in the
other larger towns plus 1000 volunteers.
''Every time we have been sending firefighters up here from Inverness,
we have had to call out retained men from Nairn to cover smaller fires
in Inverness. They get a call-out fee then an hourly rate. This has been
stretching the budget.''
He said Army back-up remained an option that the brigade could use if
demands increased. Already call-outs were running about 34 a day, an
increase of 50% on last year.
Mr Gordon said the question of extra resources would be raised at the
next meeting of the Fire Board next month.
The Fire Board chairman, Wester Ross Councillor Norman Cameron, said
he would back any call for extra resources given that the fire service
was having to deal with one of the worst droughts in 100 years.
He was not only looking to the Government for extra resources:''The
other thing is that the people who have the privilege of owning huge
tracts of land should do more financially and with manpower to reduce
demands on the brigade.
''These large fires cost an inordinate amount of public money and
there already is public money going in to regenerate woodland, etc. But
every case on its merits. We don't want small crofters having to foot
the bill.''

<HEADLINE>Profile raised in fight to save pool</HEADLINE>

<PAGE>4</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>976863385</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A CAMPAIGN to save North Berwick pool -- one of only three remaining
outdoor pools in Scotland -- intensified last night with the formation
of a group to co-ordinate opposition to closure.
The pool is due to close in two weeks but objectors have sought
outside sponsorship and have raised a petition with more than 1000
signatures.
Mrs Norma Loudon, one of the campaigners, said: ''My feeling is that
it would be extremely short-sighted to close the pool. It is a fantastic
tourist asset and impacts on the town's economy.''
She said campaigners wished to work with East Lothian District Council
to explore ways of keeping the pool open in summer. Because of the
recent hot spell, it was doing its best business as closure loomed.
''It has never been marketed as an attraction in any of the tourist
literature and there is nothing else to bring together youngsters of all
ages in North Berwick,'' she added.
Mrs Loudon said the pool could be retained and lessons learned from
the remaining outdoor pools at Gourock and Stonehaven.
According to the council, which plans to open an indoor pool and
upgrade the leisure centre in North Berwick next year, the outdoor pool
costs #72,000 a year to run.
A council spokesman said although visitor numbers rose modestly to
4000 last month, this contrasted with 3500 a week at a new indoor pool
at Musselburgh.

A SERIOUS gap which could send council tax bills soaring next year has
emerged in the finances of the new City of Glasgow Council.
The grave implications of the #79m shortfall will be spelled out at a
seminar for all councillors to be held next week.
If this size of financial hole had to be filled entirely from council
tax payments, it would mean increases in bills of up to 70%.
This would clearly be unacceptable, as it would raise average bills
above #1100, and Glasgow's Labour leaders will now argue the city's case
strongly in the Cosla/Scottish Office working group, which deals with
local government finance.
The difficulties have been highlighted with the drawing up of notional
budgets for the current year for the 29 new unitary councils, along with
individual spending assessments on which the Government bases its
distribution of grant, and also its capping criteria.
The new Glasgow council's notional budget totals #805m, but the
council's spending assessment, on which grant is based, is just over
#726m.
Reorganisation has forced the ''disaggregation'' of regional council
budgets to the new unitary authorities, and the process has produced a
number of winners and losers.
If present mechanisms are allowed to operate, another loser is the new
Dundee City Council, which faces a budgetary gap of 12%, compared to
Glasgow's 11% (#79m).
The new Glasgow council's Labour leader, Councillor Bob Gould, said he
was ''seriously concerned'' about the financial picture which had
emerged.
He claimed the Government had pushed through reorganisation as quickly
as it could and had to recognise the difficulties this had produced.
Councils could not be blamed.
So far, the Government seems determined that it will not come up with
any new money.
Instead, a transitional scheme will be discussed between Cosla and
Scottish Office officials, which would redistribute available resources
for next year in a way which will help councils like Glasgow and Dundee.
The discussions will be difficult, as the scheme would mean some of
the winners -- like East Renfrewshire -- losing grant.

SPECTATORS at Celtic Park and Ibrox Stadium will be able to place bets
on the outcome of matches and likely goal-scorers at special betting
facilities inside the grounds from early this season.
Track betting licences, allowing bookmakers to operate at various
points in the grounds, were yesterday granted by Glasgow District
Council's licensing committee to both teams.
The decision means the clubs will join several other top Scottish
clubs who have installed betting facilities at their grounds since
Scottish Football League rules were altered in May last year.
Bookmakers are now allowed to take bets on football matches inside
grounds with club approval.
This followed the success of similar betting facilities in England,
where 36 clubs have them installed.
The licensing board granted the licences to Celtic and Rangers under
the Betting, Gaming, and Lotteries Act (1963) following site visits last
week.
Yesterday they heard there had been no objections from building
control, environmental health, police or fire service officials.
The licensing committee also granted a licence to Queens Park Football
Club for the use of betting facilities at Hampden Park.
The betting facilities at Celtic and Rangers' grounds -- eight kiosks
in Celtic Park's two existing stands and 11 kiosks and four counters in
various parts of Ibrox Stadium -- are to be operated by Ladbroke, which
runs almost all betting facilities at Scottish grounds.
Those clubs which have them include Hearts, Hibernian, Aberdeen,
Motherwell, Partick Thistle, and St Johnstone.
The company, which is the world's biggest bookmakers, is responsible
for all costs regarding the setting up and running of the kiosks or
counters and pays the host club a commission based on turnover of the
betting facilities.
Ladbroke yesterday estimated that Old Firm betting facilities would
create extra work for about 56 employees, including supervisors.

ANIMAL rights protester Jill Phipps may have deliberately thrown
herself under the wheels of a truck carrying veal calves, police
yesterday told an inquest into her death.
Superintendent David Whitehouse, of Warwickshire Police, who
controlled the policing on February 1 when Miss Phipps died, told the
first day of the Coventry hearing that he could not be responsible for
her actions.
He said he had seen her run in front of the lorry ''perhaps with her
hands raised, then slip or possibly deliberately fall''.
Miss Phipps, 31, was crushed to death by the lorry as it carried
calves into Coventry Baginton airport to be flown to the continent.
The inquest jury was shown video film taken by police as a convoy of
two police vans and the truck drove at about 20mph towards the airport.
Miss Phipps and around eight other protesters were shown running
around in the road attempting to halt the truck by standing in front of
it and trying to chain themselves to it.
Police had been criticised for allowing the protesters to break
through a cordon of officers towards a moving vehicle and for failing to
stop the truck until they had been moved from the area.
Superintendent Whitehouse, who watched the video of the moments before
Miss Phipps's death and the final impact, said: ''I saw Miss Phipps run
up to the front of the lorry and appear to stand in front of it, perhaps
with her arms raised, and then slip or possibly deliberately fall.''
Miss Phipps, a lifelong animal rights campaigner and vegetarian, who
had received a two-year suspended prison sentence for her direct action
in the past, died almost instantly after her spine was severed by the
force of the lorry's wheel driving on to her chest.
Her mother, 70-year-old Nancy Phipps, another veteran campaigner,
broke down and wept as she told the court her daughter had been a
sacrifice made in the fight to stop live exports.

LEADING junior club Shotts have been thrown out of Scottish football.
The decision of the Central League to expel them was backed yesterday at
a special SFA appeal meeting.
The league had taken the decision over claims that they had filed
inaccurate medical reports showing that they did not have enough players
to take part in a game last season.
However, Shotts was given some slight relief, as the SFA has decided
that the Central League should decide on a set period of expulsion.

SAFETY on Railtrack is either inadequate and unlikely to be
satisfactory for at least 18 months, or a robust safety management
system is in place and the issue of safety is paramount. These
propositions are so contradictory that someone must be wrong. Our bet is
that Mr Jack Rose, Railtrack's track manager in charge of safety
assessment and the author of the leaked report warning of another
Clapham disaster, is likely to know more about safety than Transport
Minister Steven Norris, former Transport Secretary Dr Brian Mawhinney,
and sundry Railtrack loyalists all rolled together. The row over safety
has left the Government's privatisation plans hanging by a ragged
fingernail.
It is worth reminding ourselves of these plans for they encapsulate
the shambles of a privatisation policy which exposes the gulf between
the vision of ideologues and objective reality. The end of last month
saw the deadline for bids for the first three passenger franchises.
Formal, binding bids have to be submitted by October and the first
handover to the private sector will take place around Christmas. The
franchises, which vary from seven to 10 years, will begin on April 1
next year and by that time the Government hopes to have privatised some
51% of passenger services. The timetable sounds impressive but it is
unlikely to be any more accurate than one derived from an examination of
the entrails of a chicken. The City is full of experts who think that
rail privatisation is a horrendously risky venture, and the safety
debate has sharpened their anxieties. The leaked memo by Mr Rose appears
to refer to the problem of court appearances by Railtrack, presumably in
the aftermath of an accident. Legal liability is the last thing
investors want to hear about, especially when coupled with warnings of
inadequate safety procedures. The franchise bidding process is secret
but the number of groups interested in the original franchises is
certainly less than expected. Labour will publish its response to rail
privatisation in November and the possibility of a Labour Government has
heightened interest in this document. At the very least it must propose
substantially tougher regulation than that envisaged by the present
Government.  Better still, it should propose ways of restoring a
publicly owned and accountable rail network. Then we will have the
safety which the public deserves and the hope of an integrated network
which British industry so urgently needs.

. . . in your ear, Michael. Again you made the right noises about
listening yesterday when you invited responses to your consultation
paper on giving parents an #1100 voucher to buy pre-school education for
their children. You said: ''We will work in partnership across the wide
range of interests because it is important to get the right framework
for Scotland's distinctive needs, while devolving choice right to
individual families.'' That D-word again. But let's talk about choice.
Now #1100 is #1100 in anybody's book. Choice is different: #1100 is a
tidy sum to top up your child's nursery fees -- which may be #4000 a
year -- if you and your husband hold down good jobs and live in a nice
area. But if you live in a housing scheme and you take your voucher to
the local authority nursery you'll find that it doesn't even meet the
cost of a basic full-time place. This playing field is not level,
Michael. In Lothian region's case the difference would be more than #100
per head, in Strathclyde's about #300. Of course authorities would not
turn you away. Michael, your paper says: ''In the public sector, local
authorities would not be able to charge more than the voucher value, but
could spend more per place if necessary.''
What's this? Councils spend more? If they do, would you cap them?
Please tell us, because this is not just about making up the difference
to protect the service and maintain quality. Michael, your paper hopes
that authorities -- which, let us remind ourselves, provide the lion's
share of pre-schooling -- will be able to increase their provision by
using the voucher to offset the cost of each additional place. How, when
each new place will cost perhaps #300? Are we being unimaginative in our
coverage when we ask if this (pious?) hope amounts to a tacit admission
that the value of the voucher is insufficient? When we wonder if you see
the dreaded EU words before you as you target those who may think the
most of your vouchers, and thank you for introducing them: Election,
Upcoming.

TWO women who charged a local authority with racial discrimination
because they failed to make a shortlist, had their claims rejected by an
industrial tribunal in Edinburgh, yesterday.
The tribunal said one of the women, Ms Neelam Bakshi, was not
considered for the position because she was a Strathclyde Regional
Councillor.
Ms Pramila Kaur, of Howth Terrace, and Ms Bakshi, of Broughton Road,
both Glasgow, applied to Falkirk District Council for a post as
women's/equal opportunities officer but neither was shortlisted and the
job went to a white woman.
The tribunal was told the district council, whose workforce is just
less than 1700, employs just two people from ethnic minorities and had
no specific target for improving the statistics.
Both Ms Kaur and Ms Bakshi suggested that, on racial grounds, they had
each been treated less favourably than the other candidates who had been
shortlisted.
A total of 38 applications were received for the job and all of the
candidates, with the exception of Ms Kaur and Ms Bakshi, were white. The
seven women shortlisted were of UK origin.
The tribunal was told the shortlisting process was carried out by Mr
Bernard McCallum, the council's assistant director of personnel. With
regard to Ms Kaur, he decided she did not meet one of the essential
criteria for the job -- degree standard or equivalent.
Mr McCallum said Ms Bakshi, a Strathclyde Regional Councillor
representing Glasgow's Maryhill/Summerston ward and with a Glasgow
University degree and strong inter-personal skills, met two of the
essential criteria.
However, he did not regard her as meeting the third criteria, which
was appropriate experience in the field of women's/equal opportunities'
issues.
In its findings, the tribunal said that, with regard to Ms Kaur, Mr
McCallum did not exclude her from the shortlist on racial grounds, and
added: ''She did not meet the first of the essential criteria, in that
she did not hold a degree or equivalent qualification.''
When it came to Ms Bakshi, the tribunal stated that the inference it
drew ''was that Mr McCallum rejected the applicant because of her status
as a Strathclyde Regional Councillor''.
The tribunal dismissed the complaints from both women that they had
been racially discriminated against.

THE VJ anniversary was marked yesterday by a statement of remorse from
the Japanese prime minister, an angry reaction from Allied veterans, and
a virtual boycott of a ceremony on the River Kwai.
The ''Peace March'' over the Kwai was attended by only three Allied
veterans and their comrades at home were also outraged by the latest
apology from Japanese prime minister Tomiichi Murayama for his country's
wartime atrocities.
They reacted angrily to his insistence that there was no question of
paying compensation for their suffering.
Mr Murayama's VJ-Day statement had the weight of the Japanese
Government behind it as the wording was cleared by all three partners in
the ruling coalition.
For the first time in a public speech about the war, a Japanese prime
minister used the word ''apology''.
''I express here once again my feelings of deep remorse and state my
heartfelt apology,'' he said in a brief statement.
A spokesman for the Royal British Legion Scotland said members he had
spoken to yesterday regarded Mr Murayama's statement as ''words in the
wind'' and ''not from the heart''.
Mr Tom McGowran, secretary of the Scottish Far East Prisoners of War
Association, which has 600 members, said that no form of apology would
be regarded as recompense for the appalling things that had happened to
inmates in the Japanese prison camps.
Mr Tom Wright, chairman of the Scottish area of the Burma Star
Association, said Mr Murayama was probably sincere in apologising but
''this doesn't represent the views of his cabinet or the nation''.
Mr Alex Bain, secretary of the Edinburgh branch of the Burma Star and
former chairman of its Scottish area, gave his personal view that
insistence on receiving an apology should be dropped.
''It has become a bit of a farce. If you have suffered serious
maltreatment, I don't think an apology 50 years later would make any
difference.''
Pressed about compensation for victims of prison camps, Japan's
ambassador to London, Mr Hiroki Fuji, said, ''We apologise for what we
have done to them during the war,'' but added that the legal question of
prisoners of war had been settled by the San Francisco peace treaty of
1951.
Royal British Legion veterans and relatives held a VJ- Day service
outside the Japanese-owned County Hall in London yesterday.
Wreaths were also laid at a service at Britain's highest war memorial,
a cairn of stones on the summit of Ben Nevis.

WASPS are lurking in every crack and corner, nesting in lofts, in
garages, under eaves, down holes. They have been tempted to breed at a
frenetic rate in the hot sun, and driven to snatch a bite at normally
covered Scottish flesh.
Environmental health officers yesterday reported an unprecedented
number of complaints about wasp bikes. In Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Glasgow,
and Dundee, calls are more than double that of last year and many
district councils have been forced to draft in additional staff.
Maintenance officers in Edinburgh, where there are 350 calls coming in
every day, have been taken from cemeteries and parks to don protective
clothing and hound the wasps from their papery lairs.
The district's environmental health director, Mr Richard Carson, said:
''In 30 years, I've never come across anything like it. You see wasps in
the weirdest places. I've been chased up the Royal Mile wearing a floral
tie. You could say there was a group of people in Edinburgh who have
been secretly praying for freezing weather.''
In Glasgow, teams of pest control officers and eight additional staff
are blitzing a different area of the city each day. Council pest control
officer James Prescott admitted that the strategy meant some people were
waiting for up to 10 days before a nest was destroyed. His department
had taken 6000 calls this summer -- around 300 calls every day.
He proffered one theory for the wasp explosion. ''There's a chap who
worked here for over 30 years who said he rarely recalled seeing wasps
in the 1950s. Since then, the city's been smokeless and the wasps have
appeared in cycles. He thought there are more wasps now because the air
is cleaner.''
Worrying news then for those breathing clean North Sea air in
Aberdeen. With the discovery of nests prompting more than 80 calls a
day, the real sting for Aberdonians is that a visit from the city
council pest control unit will cost private householders #29 plus VAT.

DR Brian Mawhinney, Tory Party chairman, said yesterday that he
planned to include a visit to Monklands in his summer tour of ''loony
left'' Labour controlled councils.
He intends to ''listen personally to what people on the ground think
about the sort of treatment that is being handed out to them by those
who are claiming to be renewed and reborn, but who are in practice
following exactly the same old policies with the same old ideology in
the real world that we have always associated with the Labour Party''.
At a news conference, he listed huge debts run up by Labour councils
before heading today for North-east England, where he will try to
contrast the ''new Labour'' image presented by Mr Tony Blair with what
he calls the reality of Labour rule on the ground.
His catalogue of debts run up by seven leading Labour councils,
including Liverpool and Bristol and some London boroughs, showed that
many were deeper in the red than some Third World countries.
He said the councils evidently hoped that, if Labour came to power, it
would allow them to write off this debt. He challenged Shadow Chancellor
Gordon Brown to say whether he would permit this or not.
Birmingham's debt is #1280m, more than that of Malawi. Greater
Manchester's debt is #1170m, about the same as Paraguay, and costing the
city taxpayers #196 a minute to service the interest.
Lambeth has a debt of around #900m, more than Lebanon which has
emerged from years of civil war. It also has the country's worst council
tax collection record, taking in only 56% by March of this year.
Islington has debt of #880m, more than Sierra Leone, costing the
equivalent of #1212 in annual interest payments for all the borough's
householders, who include the Blairs.
Liverpool's debt of #800m is as much as that of Haiti and Barbados
combined.
Newcastle has debts of #440m, as much as Algeria which has a hundred
times as big a population. South Tyneside's debt of #355m, more than
that of Cambodia, costs #60 a minute in interest payments.
Dr Mawhinney said: ''These figures are startling evidence of the price
which has to be paid for real Labour government. Real Labour comes with
a hefty price tag attached.''

THE board of directors at the troubled East Park Home and School for
profoundly handicapped children in Glasgow has agreed an undisclosed
''financial settlement'' with the former matron, who was dismissed
earlier this year.
An agreed joint statement, issued yesterday, confirmed the settlement
on the eve of an industrial tribunal in Glasgow into the circumstances
of the sacking of Mrs Eleanor McCreadie, 55, who was matron of the home
for eight years.
Evidence was expected to have been heard in Glasgow today and
tomorrow.
The statement, on the home's headed notepaper, said: ''Mrs Eleanor
'Lynn' McCreadie left the employment of East Park on March 22, 1995, in
circumstances which East Park have recognised constituted unfair
dismissal.
''There was, and is, no doubt that Mrs McCreadie has at all times
acted in the best interest of the children entrusted to her care.''
The statement added that both parties had agreed that no further
comment should be made on the matter.
Mrs McCreadie's sudden dismissal, for no apparent reason, from her
post at the charity-run home in Maryhill, where she earned an estimated
#25,000 a year, provoked an angry response from politicians, doctors,
and unions. The home declined to go into detail about the sacking,
although it conceded professional misconduct was not involved.
Later it emerged that the new general manager, Mrs May Henderson, was
involved in a relationship with the man who carried out a staff review
at the home -- Dr Kenneth McAlpine, a geriatrician at Paisley's Royal
Alexandra Hospital.

FILM star Britt Ekland posed beside a sculpture of runaway lovers at
Gretna Green yesterday and scotched any talk of a third marriage for
herself.
Opening a new sculpture park at Gretna, Ms Ekland, 53, said she would
have loved to have been married over the blacksmith's anvil.
''It's a fabulous idea. No contracts, no politics, just bang and
you're married,'' she said, before quickly adding: ''but my marrying
days are over''.
The Swedish-born actress's two marriages -- to the late actor Peter
Sellers and to drummer Jim MacDonnell -- were dissolved.
The Gretna sculptures include several on a romantic theme, including
The Runaway Lovers by John Tonks, of Worcester.
They are the work of nine amateur and eight professional sculptors who
attend Birmingham University.
Three of the sculptures have been commissioned as permanent features
and the rest are for sale.

AN open-cast coal company that wants to develop a site close to the
villages of Ormiston and Elphinstone in East Lothian was given a muted
reception at a public meeting held last night to discuss the plans.
As The Herald revealed earlier this week, an application to mine 202
acres by Slamannan-based William Grant (Mining) Ltd, has been lodged
with East Lothian District Council.
Another company has submitted plans to work another area close by --
and more than 200 people gathered for an information meeting.
A spokesman for Grant outlined plans which, he said, would include
working a 12-hour shift from 7am on weekdays, with no heavy lorries
passing through either village.
There would be no loss of rights of way, and after five years the land
would be restored to agricultural use, he said.
The meeting was told that even if the council rejected the
applications, the companies could appeal to the Secretary of State.
Mr David Carlisle, chairman of Campaign for the Ormiston Environment
(COE), warned that a number of issues had to be addressed.
Local people would have to consider the impacts of noise, dust, visual
intrusion on the landscape -- and the economy, Mr Carlisle said.

TEENAGER James McGregor, who hit a 79-year-old grandmother on a
pelican crossing while driving a stolen car, was given eight years
detention and banned from driving for life yesterday.
The Shogun Landcruiser hurled widow Jean McGillvary almost 50ft and,
as she lay dying from her injuries, l8-year-old McGregor raced away
pursued by angry motorists.
The High Court in Glasgow heard that McGregor, a youth ''with a
fascination for joyriding'' shook off his pursuers, jumped out of the
Landcruiser, scrambled over a barbed wire fence, and fled over fields.
Witnesses identified him from photographs and, when he was arrested at
his home at Downfield Street, Tollcross, Glasgow, police found the
jacket he had torn on the fence.
McGregor admitted the reset of the stolen vehicle, driving it
dangerously, and causing the Mrs McGillvary's death in Mill Street,
Rutherglen, and failing to stop.
Temporary Judge John Horsburgh was told that, two-and-a-half months
before the accident, McGregor had been released on licence from another
sentence involving reckless driving and car theft.
He ordered McGregor to serve the two-and-a-half months before the
eight-year sentence starts and told him: ''Your record clearly shows
that your fascination for cars is a very dangerous one which reached its
climax in this tragic accident.
''There is a need to protect the public from people like you who not
only steal vehicles but drive them in a way which is reckless or
dangerous.''
Mr James Scott, prosecuting, said that Mrs McGillvary, of Croftend
Avenue, Croftfoot, Glasgow, lived with her son, and she also had two
daughters. She had good health and eyesight.
About 9.30am that day, a taxi driver had to brake suddenly when
McGregor shot out of Johnstone Drive, in Rutherglen, and across a dual
carriageway in Mill Street.
He then drove up to a pelican crossing, where another vehicle was
stopped with the lights at red, and struck Mrs McGillvary.
Witnesses said he seemed to slow down momentarily before driving away
chased by other motorists.
Mrs McGillvary died from multiple injuries in hospital shortly
afterwards.
Mr Scott said that, during a taped interview with police, McGregor
described how he went for a run to Rutherglen.
McGregor said: ''I suppose I tried to go through a red light. There
was a motor sitting there but I never saw the old lady. When I looked
back, I saw there was someone lying on the ground.''
Mr Gerald Carroll, defending, said the accused's parents had separated
three years ago and, in the past, McGregor had been put under the
supervision of the children's panel for truancy and other offences.
Mr Carroll said: ''He has an absolute fascination for cars coupled
with an irresistible urge to drive them.''
Mr Carroll said he had never known any accused to show such genuine
anguish and remorse and he was so stricken while on remand that the
authorities considered calling in a psychologist for him.
* An eight-year-old girl is recovering in hospital from serious injury
after being struck by a stolen car in Uphall, West Lothian.
Samantha Maxwell was walking along Middleton Road with her 11-year-old
brother when the girl was struck after the car skidded, pushing her
against a tree, and causing serious leg and pelvic injuries.
The occupants of the car then ran from the scene.
Lothian and Borders Police said last night that two men had been
arrested in connection with the incident. They were expected to appear
at Linlithgow Sheriff Court today.

GLASGOW warship yard Yarrow yesterday lodged a multi-million pound bid
to build three frigates for the Royal Navy -- and at the same time
warned its workforce to prepare for redundancies.
A delay in the Ministry of Defence's timetable for ordering the
frigates has meant that even if the Clyde yard is successful, workers
will have to be laid off before then because of a gap in the work at the
yard.
Yarrow Shipbuilders Limited is in a straight fight for the three new
Type 23 frigates with Vosper Thorneycroft from Southampton. Its previous
competitor was Swan Hunter on Tyneside, which has since closed. Now
Vosper, which has experience in building minehunters and Type 42
frigates, is keen to become Yarrow's main competitor.
Yarrow's ability to build the frigates is not in doubt after it
successfully completed six of the ships -- all named after dukes -- for
the Royal Navy, and is currently working on a further three. The fear,
however, is that Vosper will bid an unrealistically low figure for the
work simply to keep its yard busy.
YSL management has warned in the past that there would be redundancies
if it did not win orders, but frequently was successful, thus avoiding
any significant job losses.
However, in the past, the MoD ordered the frigates on a fairly regular
timetable. Now, with the Treasury trying to limit defence spending, the
timetable has slipped, meaning job losses are inevitable.
Ironically, YSL's yard at Scotstoun has rarely looked busier. Two
ships for the Malaysian Navy, plus frigates Somerset and Grafton, have
been launched and are either tied up alongside the yard or are in dry
dock being fitted out.
As weapons systems and electronic systems become more sophisticated,
increasing amounts of work are done on the ship after the basic shell
has been launched.
That means only one frigate, Sutherland, is still being built inside
the yard. Thus workers involved in steelwork and other heavy jobs
concentrated at the start of construction are more at risk from job
losses.
Some may be transferred to fitting-out work but that can only have
limited application.
No figure has yet been put on the job losses as management is still in
discussions with the unions but, with 3000 workers, large orders have to
be found on a regular basis if such a payroll is to be financed.
The unions are unlikely to oppose some job losses as they realise
people will not be kept on if there is no work. However, they will want
to be convinced that management has explored all avenues for
transferring workers to other tasks.
* Meanwhile, Glasgow Development Agency has stepped in with a #100,000
grant to help avoid redundancies at the Upper Clyde's only other major
shipbuilders, Kvaerner Govan.
The money will help retrain 250 employees to give them skills more
appropriate to the requirements of modern shipbuilding.
The GDA initially became involved when it emerged that Kvaerner would
have to sack staff and then re-employ them, if they were going to
qualify for Government training funds.
The GDA can be more flexible in its approach and came up with the cash
to avoid redundancies. The agency feared that if the workers were sacked
then some of them would leave the shipbuilding industry.
Mr Dave Donald, GDA's head of training, said yesterday: ''Our
contribution will allow the company to stabilise its workforce during a
period when it normally has to lay off a large number of its
highly-skilled men, with the risk of losing some of them.''

A DISTRAUGHT father was being consoled last night after a chip-pan
fire caused a blaze which claimed the lives of his entire family.
Taxi driver Alun James was preparing an early-morning meal when the
fire started at his terraced house in Workington, Cumbria.
His wife Andrea, 30, died along with her four children -- Andrew, 11,
Graeme, five, and Katrina Bottrell, three, all from Mrs James's previous
marriage, and the couple's 16-month-old daughter Glynis.
Hours after yesterday's fire, Mr James returned to the scene of the
tragedy and wept when he discovered a child's shoe in the charred
remains of his house.
He had steeled himself to enter the remains of his house in Church
Road in the coastal suburb of Harrington.
Leaning against a wall, he stared at the house as friends tried to
comfort him.
Neighbours walking by stopped to give a few words of comfort. An
elderly woman patted him on the arm as he shook his head in disbelief.
He then walked slowly into the house, which had blackened outer walls
and windows. Ten minutes later, Mr James came out, his face twisted in
grief.
In a joint statement last night, Cumbria police and fire service said:
''An initial investigation of the fire indicates that it started in the
kitchen of the house near the cooker.
''The fire was discovered by Mr James, who was in the house at the
time and had started to prepare a meal on the cooker. Mrs James and the
four children were all in bed at the time.''
A fire service spokesman said it had been a chip-pan fire.
Mr James rushed out of the house through the front door as the fire
spread, and neighbours raised the alarm.
Firemen wearing breathing apparatus recovered the bodies, said
Assistant Divisional Fire Office John Threapleton.
Last night, Mr James was being comforted at the home nearby of local
parish priest, Father Dyfrig Harris.
Prayers were said for the dead at a morning mass at St Mary's Roman
Catholic Church.
The service had been scheduled because of VJ-Day. A celebration to
mark the event 50 years ago, planned for last night, was cancelled as a
mark of respect.
Mr Threapleton later describing Mr James' visit to his said: ''He was
very distressed. He saw the child's shoe, picked it up and wept.
''All our sympathies go out to him. To lose one member of your family
is bad enough but to lose five is appalling.''
He said Mr James did not look around the house but stayed on the
ground floor ''out of the public view''.
Mr Threapleton, who was among the first officers to arrive at the
scene, said: ''There was very little we could do.''
The house did not have a smoke alarm but he added: ''In the
circumstances of this particular incident, I don't think it would have
made a lot of difference.''
Neighbours said the family had lived at the house for three years.
Widow Eileen Crowe, who lives opposite the house, said: ''They were a
lovely family. The children were always very well dressed.
''I will always treasure the memory of the little girls in their
bright summer frocks in the hot weather,'' Mrs Crowe added.
She described seeing the two little blonde girls being carried out of
the house in the arms of firemen. She also saw Mrs James being brought
out.
Another neighbour spoke of seeing flames shooting out of windows at
the back of the house.
''I hope I never see anything like it again,'' he said.
''There was a mass of flames. There was nothing anyone could have done
because of the fierceness of the blaze.''
An inquest will be opened today at Whitehaven.
* A woman died when her clothes caught fire as she stood beside a gas
cooker yesterday. The elderly woman, who has not been named, was
engulfed in flames in the kitchen of her home in Glastonbury, Somerset.

THIS is the translation of the statement by Japanese Prime Minister
Tomiichi Murayama given on national television yesterday to mark the
50th anniversary of his country's surrender in the Second World War:
''The world has seen 50 years elapse since the war came to an end.
Now, when I remember the many people both at home and abroad who fell
victim to war, my heart is overwhelmed by a flood of emotions.
''The peace and prosperity of today were built as Japan overcame great
difficulty to arise from a devastated land after defeat in the war. That
achievement is something of which we are proud, and let me herein
express my heartfelt admiration for the wisdom and untiring effort of
each and every one of our citizens.
''Let me also express once again my profound gratitude for the
indispensable support and assistance extended to Japan by the countries
of the world, beginning with the United States of America. I am also
delighted that we have been able to build the friendly relations which
we enjoy today with the neighbouring countries of the Asia-Pacific
region, the United States, and the countries of Europe.
''Now that Japan has come to enjoy peace and abundance, we tend to
overlook the pricelessness and blessings of peace. Our task is to convey
to younger generations the horrors of war, so that we never repeat the
errors in our history.
''I believe that, as we join hands, especially with the peoples of
neighbouring countries, to ensure true peace in the Asia-Pacific region
-- indeed, in the entire world -- it is necessary, more than anything
else, that we foster relations with all countries based on deep
understanding and trust.
''Guided by this conviction, the Government has launched the Peace,
Friendship and Exchange Initiative, which consists of two parts
promoting: support for historical research into relations in the modern
era between Japan and the neighbouring countries of Asia and elsewhere;
and rapid expansion of exchanges with those countries.
''Furthermore, I will continue in all sincerity to do my utmost in
efforts being made on the issues arisen from the war, in order to
further strengthen the relations of trust between Japan and those
countries.
''Now, upon this historic occasion of the 50th anniversary of the
war's end, we should bear in mind that we must look into the past to
learn from the lessons of history and ensure that we do not stray from
the path to the peace and prosperity of human society in the future.
''During a certain period in the not too distant past, Japan,
following a mistaken national policy, advanced along the road to war,
only to ensnare the Japanese people in a fateful crisis and through its
colonial rule and aggression caused tremendous damage and suffering to
the people of many countries, particularly to those of Asian nations.
''In the hope that no such mistake be made in the future, I regard, in
a spirit of humility, these irrefutable facts of history, and express
here once again my feelings of deep remorse and state my heartfelt
apology. Allow me also to express my feelings of profound mourning for
all victims, both at home and abroad, of that history.
''Building from our deep remorse on this occasion of the 50th
anniversary of the end of the war, Japan must eliminate self-righteous
nationalism, promote international co-ordination as a responsible member
of the international community and thereby advance the principles of
peace and democracy.
''At the same time, as the only country to have experienced the
devastation of atomic bombing, Japan, with a view to the ultimate
elimination of nuclear weapons, must actively strive to further global
disarmament in areas such as the strengthening of the nuclear
non-proliferation regime.
''It is my conviction that in this way alone can Japan atone for its
past and lay to rest the spirits of those who perished.
''It is said that one can rely on good faith. And so, at this time of
remembrance, I declare to the people of Japan and abroad my intention to
make good faith the foundation of our government policy, and this is my
vow.''

THE traditional Glasgow greetings of hullawrerr and howsitgaun will
soon be available in five languages, thanks to an innovative training
course which has been launched in the city.
The course has been developed to give people involved with tourists a
basic grounding in French, German, Italian, Spanish, and Japanese and
give them an interest in learning more.
Already a wide range of companies, including Marks and Spencer, Arnold
Clark, and Stakis Hotels, have sent people to the one-day courses held
by Glasgow Tourism Training Unit.
The course offers key phrases in the five languages spoken by the
majority of tourists visiting Scotland and also gives a guide to the
cultural minefield which is involved in dealing with people from other
countries.
The unit's Stella Callaghan said: ''There is nothing that makes a
foreign tourist feel more welcome than a few words of greeting in their
own language. It may be a simple good morning and how are you before
making it clear you are not fluent, but often that is enough.''
She added: ''It was an idea we had been kicking around for quite some
time but the established language trainers said it would not work. So
with the help of some multi-lingual trainers that we brought in, we have
got the courses under way. They have been very popular and we have many
more planned.''
The unit was particularly pleased to attract Marks and Spencer, which
normally keeps all its training in-house, and noted that Post Office
Counters had sent staff along as part of the general improvement in its
image.
A whole range of people, from bus and taxi drivers to those in the
retail trade and hotels, are taking an interest.
The courses are funded by Glasgow Development Agency.

EDUCATION groups reacted with anger last night after the Government
set out its stall for creating a marketplace in pre-five schooling in
Scotland.
It envisages local authorities, private nurseries, and the voluntary
sector competing for vouchers worth #1100, which the parents of mainly
four year olds will use to ''buy'' pre-schooling for their children at
the place of their choice.
In addition, in a Scottish Office consultation paper published
yesterday, it floated the possibility of giving the vouchers varying
values, with more going to parents in areas where provision is more
expensive -- such as the big cities -- and less to those in smaller
communities.
However, authorities, and independent nursery and playgroup
representatives, expressed concern about the voucher scheme being
bureaucratic, and divisive when the pre-five sector should be working
together.
Mrs Moira Ferguson, national executive officer of the Scottish
Pre-School Play Association, said: ''Introducing vouchers means there is
competition rather than integration.
''It could be that groups will vie with one another for four year olds
clutching vouchers but, if this is the way ahead, we will do our best to
make it work.''
Mrs Valerie Fotheringham, West of Scotland secretary of the Scottish
Independent Nurseries Association, said: ''The Government knows nursery
education is an election issue and it is trying to do something about
it.
''The three sectors should work in partnership on education and
training and sharing ideas because there is so much to offer in child
care. Vouchers could encourage the wrong kind of competition.''
Mrs Judith Gillespie, convener of the Scottish Parent Teacher Council,
said: ''The market does not work in education for supplying services.
Parents want local authority provision and the money should go straight
to authorities to help them develop proper provision.''
Strathclyde region's director of education, Mr Frank Pignatelli, said:
''We have developed a high-quality service which is quite expensive to
run. There is a question about whether we could maintain that. We would
also worry about the increased bureaucracy involved in the scheme.''
The Government has invited private companies to tender bids for
administering the scheme, which will involve issuing and redeeming the
vouchers.
It is not clear if the bureaucratic costs will come out of the annual
cost of the vouchers, which will be about #70m.
In 1997, the Government plans to send vouchers through the post to
parents of eligible children. They would exchange the vouchers for
places at an establishment of their choice.
It believes #1100 is enough to meet the cost of three terms of
high-quality pre-schooling in the year before a child would start
primary education.
It expects the value of the voucher to ''buy'' a part-time place in a
nursery and up to a full-time place in a playgroup with ''suitable''
education.
Parents would be able to top up the value if they used the voucher in
the private or voluntary sector but local authorities would not be able
to charge more than #1100. The nursery or playgroup would accept
vouchers and redeem them for cash.
About 64,000 children a year are likely to be eligible for a voucher.
According to the latest data, more than 35,000 four year olds, or about
56% of the total, were in local authority nurseries last year.
Authorities spend about #39m a year on pre-five education and the
favoured funding option put forward in the paper is to take the sum from
local government, with authorities getting it back as parents produce
their vouchers at their establishments.
The remaining #31m will meet the cost of vouchers for the other 44% of
four year olds, many of whom do not receive any pre-schooling.
The #1100 has been criticised as insufficient not only in relation to
the cost of pre-school education but also to the capital costs of
providing new facilities for the anticipated upsurge in demand.
The Government hopes authorities will offer more places by using
surplus school accommodation.

Kanchanaburi, Thailand.
It's very natural for
the former PoWs
not to come. I know
their hardships, I
witnessed them. I
also did some very
inhumane things.
Takashi Nagase,
ex-military police
ATTEMPTS to forge a final reconciliation between Allied prisoners of
war and their former Japanese enemies ended in farce yesterday as all
but three Allied veterans boycotted a ''Peace March'' over the River
Kwai.
Organisers were expecting hundreds of British, Australian, and Dutch
former PoWs to march across the bridge over the River Kwai. They were to
be greeted by an equal number of Japanese to shake hands in the middle.
At the stroke of midday, two British and one Australian veteran were
greeted by only five former Japanese Imperial Army soldiers who were
willing to atone for their past brutality.
The veterans quickly shook hands and some hugged each other. The
event, watched by more than 30 journalists, was over.
One of the British veterans, Mr Trevor Dakin, a former corporal from
the 5th Battalion of the Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire Regiment, has
lived in Kanchanaburi for the last eight years and has long forgiven his
former enemies.
He said: ''If other veterans object to this event that's their
problem. If they'd met the Japanese that I have, they would understand.
It's not the Japanese people, it's their government.''
According to Mr Dakin, 75, yesterday's apology from Japan's Prime
Minister Tomiichi Murayama did not go far enough: ''If the whole
government would make a formal and comprehensive apology and pay us
compensation for the days we worked for them, they could end the hatred.
The Germans paid trillions after the war but the Japanese -- not a
penny.''
The other Briton, Mr Dudley Cave, a Unitarian Church minister from
Golders Green, London, said he had not been tortured by the Japanese and
had no ill feeling towards them.
''I'm very much in favour of reconciliation. I've come to Thailand 22
times since the war ended and began to lay my ghosts to rest about 10
years ago. The bitter PoWs shout a lot and receive a lot of publicity
but I think there are many who do want to reconcile with the Japanese.''
The Japanese delegation was led by Takashi Nagase, a former
interpreter for the Kempetai (Japan's military police), who recently
admitted to the BBC that he had taken part in torture sessions.
Takashi said: ''It's very natural for the former PoWs not to come. I
know their hardships, I witnessed them. I also did some very inhumane
things. I was forced to take part and do wrong.
''Many of the PoWs cannot forgive. It's OK. I understand, but I hope
they will accept my apologies. I have already given up on my government,
they are heartless. Our government must apologise with compensation but
I'm very pessimistic.''
Earlier yesterday, a commemoration service was held in the grounds of
Kanchanaburi's allied war cemetery, home to the ashes of around 7000
Allied PoWs who perished making the ''Death Railway''.
Mr Christian Adams, Britain's ambassador to Thailand, made a short
speech, although an embassy source said even he was there largely
because of the high-level Thai representation.
General Chavalit Yongchayudh, Thailand's Defence Minister, presided
over the ceremony which was also for the first time attended by Japan's
ambassador to Thailand, Takashi Onda.
Mr Adams said: ''The approach of reconciliation is clearly a
controversial one but this is a unique moment in history, 50 years after
the end of the war. It is understandable that people have mixed
feelings. Our decision to come was made at the last moment.''
Mr Adams also pointed out during a short speech that a separate
British Christian service of remembrance would be held on Sunday with a
strong emphasis on those who died on the railway.
All Allied PoWs have been invited but the Japanese have not.
Thirty thousand Britons were brought to Kanchanaburi by the Japanese
after the fall of Singapore in 1942. They were forced to work in
appalling conditions forging a link for Japanese war supplies between
Thailand and Burma.
The line began construction in July 1942 and was finished with the
help of 300,000 Asian forced labourers, one year and three months later
in October 1943.
The track, more than 280 kilometres long, was said to have claimed a
life for every sleeper. Around 16,000 allies including 6500 Britons died
of malaria, dysentery, and other tropical diseases during its
construction. As many as 80,000 Asians, mainly from Indonesia, Malaysia,
and the Philippines also died.
In Manila, Philippine President Fidel Ramos and Senate leaders have
hailed Japan's apology for its actions but it was dismissed by survivors
who were used as sex slaves. About 20 women, staging a protest outside
the Japanese embassy in Manila, said they were not satisfied with it.
The group is demanding #150,000 compensation for each victim.
In Seoul, South Korea said yesterday it would wait and see what Japan
does following the apology. An official statement added: ''We want the
Japanese Government to make serious efforts to thoroughly reveal the
truth of history and have a proper understanding of history.''
* Lord Slim, whose father, the late Field Marshal Viscount Slim, led
the British Army in Burma, spoke yesterday of his disappointment at
Japan's apology.
Lord Slim, who fought in Burma, said he would rather the Japanese had
not tried to apologise at all than to fall short of clear remorse.
''Our Prime Minister has worked jolly hard for some time now to get
the Japanese to make some gesture of apology,'' he said. ''But whether
the apology we have had so far is enough is for the British Government
to say. But the one word that is always missing is 'sorry'.''

MR Tony Blair was accused yesterday by a Labour MP of attempting to
''con'' the electorate as the tide of discontent with his style of
leadership threatened to swamp the carefully constructed image of a
united party.
Blyth Valley MP Ronnie Campbell told Radio Newcastle that Mr Blair was
trying to con the south of England electorate by stealing Margaret
Thatcher's ideas.
He accused Labour of ''taking Thatcher's ideas to try to con the
people in the south that we are an electable party.''
The tough 52-year-old Geordie ex-miner said: ''I could not care less
if the Shadow Cabinet turn around and kick us in the teeth for what we
are saying, they are power mad.
''They have got it into their bloody heads that Labour is unelectable
unless it goes down this social democratic road. That is absolutely
rubbish.''
This further onslaught, following criticism from a stream of other
party members, was seized on gleefully by Tory party chairman Dr Brian
Mawhinney, who said it painted a picture of the Labour party and its
leadership ''which becomes less attractive but more accurate week by
week, indeed day by day''.
Mr Blair's office is unwilling to get into a slanging match with
critics, several of whom have always been opponents of the changes Mr
Blair, and before him Mr Kinnock, introduced.
None the less a considerable volume of dissent has surfaced in the
past week, ranging from general condemnation to opposition to particular
policies as in the case of former deputy leader Roy Hattersley.
Various forms of dissent have been registered by former Shadow Cabinet
member Bryan Gould, GMB leader John Edmonds, backbench MP Richard
Burden, Transport and General Workers Union leader Bill Morris, and a
number of left wing Labour MPs including Mr George Galloway (Hillhead)
and Mr Dennis Canavan (Falkirk West).
Dr Mawhinney smilingly declared: ''You haven't actually heard me use
such violent language against Mr Blair as is being used by his own
Members of Parliament.''
Mr Blair, who interrupts his holiday this weekend to take part in the
VJ-Day ceremonies, took sufficient notice of the criticism to issue a
statement saying that, while he had no wish to ''pick a fight'' with his
critics, he would press ahead with his crusade to modernise Labour and
make it fit to govern.
Mr Campbell attacked the way policy making has been developed in the
Labour party giving the leadership more control of what is debated at
the annual party conference.
Interviewed on BBC Radio 4's World At One he said: ''We now have a
national policy forum which is deciding policy for us. The Labour party
membership on the ground is just fodder.
''In the past, the conference used to decide policy. But it looks as
though there is a policy forum set up by people who have been educated
at university, Oxford and Cambridge, and they sit round the table and
decide what Tony Blair's next policy will be.
''We are becoming more like the Tory party, where the membership just
turns up at a little meeting and elects an MP now and then, whereas, in
the past, we used to passionately debate issues. We don't do that any
more.''
Dr Mawhinney said Mr Campbell's views came on the back of overnight
criticism from senior and respected Labour figures in local government.
''We have now learned a little more about Mr Blair's management style.
When he sees something or hears something that he doesn't like he has
some youth in his office ring up and slag off local Labour leaders
around the country.''
Mr Peter Greenwood, chairman of the Association of District Councils
and leader of Blackburn council, has accused Mr Blair of a series of
one-man U-turns on education, health, and regional government. Mr Derek
Bidman, leader of the Labour group on the Association of County
Councils, accused Mr Blair of seeing local government as Labour's
Achilles heel and wanting to move away from a regional approach to a
national system.

HEALTH board officials confirmed yesterday that 60 beds for the frail
elderly at Stobhill hospital, Glasgow, are to be phased out by April
1998.
Greater Glasgow Health Board said the move was necessary following the
decision in March to retain 60 continuing care beds for the elderly at
Lenzie hospital, which were saved after a local community campaign.
A health union official said he believed it was part of a board plan
to switch provision for elderly patients from NHS hospitals to private
nursing homes.
GGHB chairman Sir Robert Calderwood said the decision followed a
three-month consultation exercise which showed the strength of support
for the retention of Lenzie hospital as part of the complement of 180
beds required for continuing care in the north of the board's area.
He said the consultation showed there was a general view that frail
elderly people should be cared for at home or in a community setting
wherever possible.
GGHB acting general manager Tom Divers said: ''The phased closure of
the beds at Stobhill will release resources for community- based,
long-term care and domiciliary services, including respite care,
additional community health services, paramedical, and nursing care.''
Mr Dave Watson, Glasgow regional officer for health with the public
service union Unison, said: ''The board has more or less admitted that
the decision has been taken with the longer-term view to switch
provision for elderly care from NHS hospitals to private nursing care.''
The board says that, in addition to 60 beds at Lenzie hospital, 120
continuing care beds will be provided at Fourhills nursing home, near
Stobhill.

A SUTHERLAND schoolgirl enjoys one of the most expensive educations in
Britain.
While sections of the middle class struggle to raise private school
fees, Eileen Grant, six, is in a class of her own. The head gamekeeper's
daughter is the only pupil of teacher Mary Harris at the school at Loch
Coire.
It costs council taxpayers in the Highlands more than twice as much to
educate Eileen near her home than it would to send her to the most
expensive fee-paying boarding school in the land.
Yesterday, education official John Metcalfe, of Golspie, Sutherland,
estimated that it costs up to #30,000 a year for Eileen's schooling.
By comparison, Eton, Harrow, Fettes College, and Gordonstoun charge
annual fees of between #11,000 to #12,000 for boarders.
Mr Metcalfe said Eileen was taught locally ''because of the commitment
of Highland region to education in remote rural areas''.
He added: ''It would have been harmful to the youngster's development
to have taken her away from home at that age.''
Eileen lives with mother Isobel and father Albert in a cottage near
the school. There are just two inhabited houses on the 33,500-acre Loch
Coire Estate.
Mrs Harris makes a daily round trip of 70 miles to the school from her
home in Helmsdale. The last twelve miles of her journey is on a dirt
road.
Eileen, who will be seven in October, yesterday started primary three
as the new session began.
She has been the only pupil for more than a year since another family
of estate workers moved away.
At the school, which is owned by Loch Coire Estate, the teacher and
pupil have a computer and a TV with video facilities.
1 Mrs Harris moved to Sutherland from England when her husband retired
and has been teaching at Loch Coire since the school re-opened in 1989.
She said: ''The little girl works hard at her schooling and I enjoy
teaching there. It makes a change from the schools of between 300 and
400 pupils I was used to working in before I came here.''

A SCOT was one of two aid workers killed on the road to Sarajevo
yesterday when their truck crashd after the convoy it was travelling in
came under fire.
UNICEF officials said the convoy had accelerated sharply to try to
avoid the gunfire and that one of the trucks which had been carrying
food parcels into the besieged Bosnian capital had gone out of control
and crashed.
Mr Neil Golightly, 34, a bachelor from Broomhill, Glasgow, and Mr Tony
Ritchards, from London, were killed in the crash which occurred on a
dangerous mountain road early yesterday on Mount Igman.
It is the only high ground around Sarajevo under Bosnian government
control and is used as the only access to the Bosnian capital.
The two men, who worked for UNICEF previously, were part of a convoy
organised by the UK-based charity, Phoenix Aid, which Mr Golightly was
instrumental in establishing.
Last night friends were comforting Mr Golightly's mother, Helen, 56,
and his father, Harry, 69, in the family home in Broomhill. His sister,
Karen, 32, lives in Aberdeen.
Mrs Golightly spoke of the family's sadness and shock on learning of
her son's death from police yesterday.
She said her son, who celebrated his birthday last Friday, had visited
home three weeks ago.
''He phoned us on Thursday and said he was off to Bosnia. He had first
gone there in October 1993, although he had holidayed in the former
Yugoslavia some years ago.''
She said her son had given up his job as a manager with Black and
Decker in London to return to Bosnia.
Although always aware of the dangers, she said: ''Youknow where they
are and what they are doing. But you never think it will happen until it
comes to your own doorstep.
''He was very involved and felt very strongly about what he was doing.
I am sure the good work he did will continue.''
She said her son, a former pupil of Glasgow Academy and student at
Strathclyde University, had spent virtually the past two years in the
former Yugoslavia.
Mrs Golightly said a member of Phoenix Aid had told her that the
convoy had come under fire. ''As far as I am aware the convoy
accelerated to escape the danger. But I am told the roads are just
dreadful. One of the vehicles keeled over and crashed and Neil and his
friend were killed.
''I feel very proud of him. We supported him totally in what he was
doing. He was a good son to us.''
Mr Golightly, a retired police inspector, said: ''We knew the dangers,
but we had to accept that. But with relatively few of the aid workers
and UN personnel being killed, it seems so shocking that Neil has become
a victim.''
Neil had taken the Duke of Edinburgh's award as a youngster and helped
train other young people to pass the award. His great passion was rugby
and he ran the Strathclyde University rugby club while he was there.
He had also helped with Riding for the Disabled. When he came back to
Scotland, his greatest joy was to travel north to Aberdeen and visit his
sister, Karen, 32, and her two children, Jennifer, 10, and Christine,
eight.
A Foreign Office spokesman in London said last night: ''We do not know
for sure what caused the crash. Possibly they were driving without
lights to avoid attracting gun fire. It had also been raining and it was
wet.
''We understand there had been some firing on the road, but not at
them, as far as we are aware.''
Heavy rain had turned the normally dusty road into a slippery track.
The truck the men were driving rolled over several times and crashed
down a ravine late on Monday night.
French UN troops recovered the bodies.
Mr Simon Ashmore, co-founder of Phoenix Aid along with Mr Golightly,
said last night: ''We are all absolutely devastated by this. I spent
more than a year living and working with Neil in Bosnia, he was more
than just an acquaintance.
''We all think we lead charmed lives and then this happens to show us
the reality of the situation. You never really understand the situation
you are in until something like this happens.''

HERALD reporter Craig Watson, who returned from a trip to Bosnia with
Phoenix Aid two weeks ago, writes:
The volunteers in Phoenix Aid were all aware of the risks they faced
delivering supplies to the victims of war. But, driven by a sense of
frustration and anger that ordinary civilians were suffering in their
hundreds of thousands, they had left the UK to try and make a
difference.
The aid workers -- the number involved fluctuates from just a handful
to enough for a small convoy -- set up bases in Bosnia and Croatia after
arriving in the former Yugoslavia around 18 months ago.
I joined them in Split after a chance meeting at the airport three
weeks ago. The commitment of the volunteers I met was absolute. Neil
Golightly, a co-founder of the organisation, was in the UK at the time
but I spent several days with Tony Ritchards and the other workers.
The group often discussed the dangers inherent in their task, but the
conversations inevitably turned to the politics of war and the horrors
individuals had encountered in the past.
No-one I met dwelled on the dangers; the opposite in fact.

THE current hot spell is proving a mixed blessing for City Centre
Restaurants.
While it is helping keep the British at home, it is attracting large
numbers of foreign tourists, but they are all spending less once they
get inside. There was also a decline in cinema attendances which
affected sales of Deep Pan Pizzas.
Nevetheless, half-time taxable profits rose 7.7% to #6.26m on turnover
6.3% greater at #51.8m. City Centre writes off the cost of all new
openings as they occur so profits are currently depressed by the 34
planned for 1995, of which 23 will be in the second half.
These include the now up-graded Garfunkels as well as Chiquito and
Nachos Mexican restaurants and roadside diners selling burgers and
salads. Pizza is essentially ex-growth due to saturation and, dare one
say it, sheer boredom, so City Centre is pushing the Caffe Uno
pasta-oriented concept with its black and metallic surroundings.
As usual, the interim dividend is being maintained at 0.45p. Full-year
profits could improve from #14.1m to perhaps #15.8m, which points to a
2.25p dividend total.

NEW orders in the construction industry fell sharply in the second
quarter of this year but Scottish housebuilders suffered less than their
counterparts elswhere in the UK.
Scottish civil engineering contractors, on the other hand, were hit
every bit as hard as firms south of the Border.
Besides suffering cutbacks in central government spending, they faced
a dearth of new orders from the regional and district councils which
will be swept away next year to make way for 33 new single-tier
authorities.
''We are really standing on the brink of a sharp decline in activity
and employment,'' said Donald MacKenzie, Scottish representative of the
Federation of Civil Engineering Contractors.
UK construction orders fell by a seasonally adjusted 11% in the second
quarter compared to the first three months of this year, and by 14%
compared to the second quarter of 1994, the Department of the
Environment said yesterday.
The figures prompted renewed calls from the building industry for
measures to give the sector a boost. Suggestions include the restoration
of full mortgage tax relief for first-time home buyers and a cut in VAT
on house repairs from the present rate of 17.5% in the November Budget.
Mr MacKenzie urged the Government to simplify the rules of the Private
Finance Initiative to make it easier for construction firms to obtain
private finance for public works projects.
The Department of the Environment said private housing orders were
down 12% on the first quarter in the UK as a whole, but in Scotland they
rose by 3%.
Meanwhile, public housing and housing association orders showed a 12%
rise at a UK level, but in Scotland they soared 18%.
A separate trends survey carried out by the Scottish Building
Contractors' Association confirmed this brighter picture for house
builders north of the Border. It showed that Scottish housing starts
rose 7% in the second quarter despite a 15% fall in completions.
''We are either holding our own or going in the opposite direction (to
the rest of the UK),'' said Bob Campbell, the association's director.
He said Scotland had fared better than England and Wales because its
housing market was less volatile and was relatively free of negative
equity.
Alan Downie, managing director of Cala Homes, which builds houses in
both England and Scotland, added a third reason. He noted that only 55%
of Scots owned their homes, compared to about 75% of Englishmen. As a
result, there was still strong demand from first-time buyers on this
side of the Border.
''We are about to start seven new sites in the next six months which
total 800 houses and #80m. That is a statement of our confidence in the
Scottish economy,'' he said.
However, the Scottish trend in industrial and commercial building is
more downbeat and in line with the rest of the UK.
The Scottish Building Contractors' Association survey of more than 100
building firms showed ''a fair reduction of industrial building work''
in the second quarter, Mr Campbell said.
Commercial construction was boosted though by a number of shopping
centre developments and ''just about held its own'', he added.
The Department of the Environment said UK infrastructure orders
slumped 26% in the second quarter and Mr MacKenzie of the Federation of
Civil Engineering Contractors said this gloomy scenario applied fully to
Scotland.
Not only was the Government holding back on major road and rail
investment projects but local authorities were failing to carry out
routine maintenance of secondary roads because of spending limits
imposed by Whitehall, he said.
He added that, if the Government continued its spending cuts into
1996, Scottish civil engineering contractors would lose #100m of new
business.
''The planned cuts in spending are very, very worrying,'' he said,
noting that some Scottish firms had pulled out of contracting work
altogether. He said one company, which he refused to name, laid off 100
employees last month as it abandoned contracting work to concentrate on
quarrying.
He maintained the situation was particularly difficult in Scotland
since the out-going regional and district councils had postponed the
award of many new contracts.
There was little chance the incoming single-tier local authorities
would start placing these orders until the autumn of 1996, he added.

THE French franc, the world's first decimal coinage, had a subdued
200th birthday on Tuesday overshadowed by plans for its demise by the
end of the century.
''The forgotten bicentenary of the franc,'' said the daily newspaper
Le Parisien of a lack of official fanfare for the currency introduced in
the wake of the 1789 revolution.
In a drive to rationalise weights and measures, France voted on August
15, 1795, to introduce the franc, made up of 10 decimes or 100 centimes.
It replaced the royal livre, awkwardly split into 20 sous, which in turn
each comprised 12 deniers.
Now France wants to replace the franc with a single European currency
from 1999 as part of European Union moves for closer integration.
A few dedicated numismatists hailed the anniversary of the first
decimal coinage, saying it inspired similar systems around the world and
was a landmark in the history of modern France.
''By identifying the people, the nation, and the currency with the
same name, you have the cement of national unity,'' said Laurent
Schmitt, co-author of a book about the currency.
The original franc was worth 4.4 grams of silver and its value was
later pegged to gold under Napoleon.
After great stability during the nineteenth century, it suffered a
string of devaluations in the 20th, starting during the First World War
and the 1929 world economic crisis. -- Reuter

RANK Organisation, which recently realised #620m from the sale of its
40% stake in Rank Xerox, and MCA, the entertainment subsidiary of the
Canadian-based Seagram company, are planning to build a second theme
park in Florida which could rival Disneyworld when it opens in 1999.
The projected $2000m (#1200m) ''destination resort'', to be known as
Universal City Florida (UCF), will be built on the land in Orlando which
already contains Universal Studios Florida (USF), the existing theme
park jointly owned by Rank and MCA.
A second theme park will be built with five individually themed
islands involving ideas such as Jurassic Park, Seuss Landing based on
the globally popular world of Doctor Seuss, Marvel Comics Superheroes
including Spiderman and X-Men, and Popeye and his fellow Sweethaven
cartoon residents. Each island will contain state of the art fun and
thrill rides and shows, live entertainment, restaurants, and retail
outlets.
On top of this, the project will have a 12-acre day and night
entertainment zone consisting of themed restaurants, nightclubs, a
16-screen, 5000-seat cinema, and retail outlets, open to both visitors
at the theme parks and the public.
There will be parking facilities, moving walkways, and infrastructure
to support the existing USF park, Universal's Island of Adventure, and
the entertainment zone, and it is also planned to build two hotels with
another two to follow later.
The financing for the project, which Rank shareholders are being asked
to approve at an EGM on October 3, is partly through a $1200m (#770m)
bank facility with the balance of $800m being provided jointly by Rank
and MCA. Rank's share of the joint financing is estimated at
approximately #256m over the period to opening and Rank will provide the
banking syndicate with a completion guarantee of #385m up to the opening
of the park.
In addition to this, the two partners will be seeking to raise $600m
for building the two hotels and discussions are in progress with
possible hotel equity investors to provide finance although Rank and MCA
plan to participate in the equity.
There is a buy/sell agreement which means that, if either partner
wishes to sell its interest, it must be offered to the other at a fair
price and not to a third party.
The existing Universal Studios Florida, in which Rank invested $273m
in December 1990, is now the third most visited attraction in North
America after the two Disney theme parks. The success of USF, whose paid
attendances have increased annually to a figure of around 6.4 million in
1994, with revenues of $317m and an operating profit of $51m, have
encouraged Rank and MCA to develop plans for expansion.
Rank said the development plans will continue to benefit from the
creative talents of Steven Spielberg, a special creative consultant to
the UCF project. MCA will continue to act as manager of USF and will
also manage the new theme park.

NORTHERN Venture Managers has released the prospectus for its #15m
venture capital trust, one of the first to get underway since the new
kind of investment companies were announced in the last Budget.
Investors putting money into the trust can obtain tax relief and
receive tax-free dividends and capital gains. They are designed to plug
the ''equity gap'' for companies seeking to raise finance of up to #1m.
Sponsored by stockbroker Wise Speke, Northern Venture Trust will
invest in about 20 small companies, primarily in Scotland and the north
of England. It will have a full stock market listing and the board
includes Primrose McCabe, immediate past president of the Institute of
Chartered Accountants of Scotland, and Ian Ritchie, who is involved in
the Scottish Business Forum.
Northern Venture Managers' investment director Tim Levett said few
venture capital trusts had been announced to date because only a handful
of fund managers had extensive experience of the relevant type and size
of investment.
The rules state 70% of the funds have to be invested within three
years in unquoted firms which must be trading and have gross assets of
not more than #10m. No single investment can exceed #1m.
His company, on the other hand, is an established specialist which can
point to a 10-year track record of similar investments. Between 1984 and
1995, its two venture capital funds made more than 60 unquoted
investments and an overall return of 12.8%. Northern Investors managed
23%.
There will be a placing and offer for sale of shares in Northern
Venture Trust.
* Abtrust High Income Trust, which invests in high-yielding shares in
other UK investment trusts, yesterday announced a third interim dividend
of 1.6p. This takes the payout for the nine months to end-June to 4.6p.
The #24m fund, launched in April 1994, suffered a 12.4% fall in nav to
78.14p during the nine months. This was attributed to the poor
performance of high-yielding, split-level income shares.
Abtrust High Income made earnings per share of 4.6p during the nine
months.
