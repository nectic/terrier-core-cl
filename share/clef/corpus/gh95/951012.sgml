THERE was a strong Conservative case for a national minimum wage that
should appeal to one-nation Conservatives anxious to demonstrate their
social concern and those on the right eager to ensure whether welfare
spending was as well spent as it ought to be, TUC general secretary John
Monks told a Tory conference fringe meeting yesterday.
Mr Monks, who has addressed fringe meetings at all of the main party
conferences this year, argued that there was growing public support for
a minimum wage to end the disgrace of poverty pay because people were
fed up with claims of exploitation at work, as exemplified by the recent
row over pay at Burger King, and concern about the increasing gap
between rich and poor.
Ordinary taxpayers were angry that they were subsidising, through
payment of in-work benefits to low-paid workers, scrooge employers who
could well afford to pay a better basic wage.
He said that the Government had shifted the cost of sick pay on to
employers -- privatising sick pay some called it -- and perhaps there
now was a case for privatising in-work benefits by making employers pay
a decent minimum wage.
The TUC general secretary told the audience that women and
particularly part-time women were worst affected by low pay. Out of more
than five million employees earning less than #4 an hour, 3.5 million
were women -- just over two million of them part-timers.
In due course, the TUC would identify a target figure for the minimum
it would like to see introduced.

SCOTTISH rental levels stood still across all of the property sectors
during September, according to the Richard Ellis Scottish Monthly Index,
produced exclusively for The Herald.
The RESMI Index tracks monthly and annual changes in the total
returns, capital growth, and rental growth across Scotland's office,
retail, and industrial sectors. The current annual rental growth figures
for retail and industrial sectors remain at 1.2% and 0.6% respectively,
while offices increased to 0.2%.
Annual capital growth has remained positive, but at lower rates. The
annual capital growth for for all property slowed to 1.5%, while growth
in the office sector slowed to 0.6%. The retail sector saw a reduction
in annual growth from 4.1% to 3.3% and the industrial sector declined
from 1.9% to 0.9% over the last year.
The monthly capital growth figures improved only in the industrial
sector, while declining very slightly in the office and retail sectors.
There were no significant changes in yields during September. Office
total returns remained at 8.4% while the retail and industrial sectors
showed reductions in total returns to 9.4% and 10.2% respectively due to
the downward movement in capital growth.
As a result, the ''all property'' total returns showed a reduction
from 9.5% to 8.9%.

THE SFA is expanding its programme of drug testing, and now random
tests will be carried out on players on the training round.
However, the decision by the authority's executive committee was taken
before the news of the Barry Lavety affair came to light.
The St Mirren striker is receiving treatment after he failed a drugs
test carried out by the club.
Now all teams can expect the SFA's medical staff to appear at any time
to random test players and, in letters which have been arriving this
week, they have been alerted that the programme of testing after matches
is being extended.
An SFA official said: ''Our executive commitee recently decided this
after a recommendation by the medical sub-committee. This follows a
recent revision of policy by the Sports Council to include
out-of-competition testing.
''All clubs have been informed that there will be random testing at
training and at squad gatherings.''
Tony Higgins, secretary of the Scottish Professional Footballers'
Association, said that his organisation is in the process of making a
video to warn young players of the dangers of drugs.
''It would be naive of anyone to think that young players don't come
into contact with drugs,'' he said. ''We are concerned that some players
will get mixed up in the misuse of drugs and we want to ram the message
home.''
* AN apprentice jockey has been banned for two months after having
failed a drug test. Sean McCarthy, 22, had his licence withdrawn after a
urine sample showed traces of cannabis and amphetamine, better known as
''speed.''
The rider, who has ridden five winners from just 10 rides, now must
undergo a course of rehabilitation and pass another test before he can
reapply for his licence.
McCarthy is the first jockey in Britain to fail a drug test.

'Lapses of concentration may have dented the confidence that Brown has
been trying to build among his players'
Sweden......2
Scotland....0
SCOTLAND'S defence, bulwark of the team during the European
championship campaign, blundered twice inside four first-half minutes
against Sweden in Stockholm last night. The mistakes were enough to send
the side crashing to their first defeat in almost a year.
The Swedes, who will not even be in the European finals in England
next summer, were gifted the goals in 31, and 35 minutes. That gave them
the victory they wanted in the Rasunda Stadium, something to appease
their fans who have seen them stumble out of the European Championships
so soon after their magnificent World Cup performances in the United
States, where they finished third.
Last night the Swedes must be wondering why they will spend the summer
at home while Scotland look certain to be in the finals.
It was a night when the defence, so extravagantly praised by the
national manager Craig Brown, suddenly and surprisingly lost
concentration at two vital moments.
In a game in which Brown had decided to strengthen that defensive
system, with Alan McLaren playing in front of the three main central
defenders, there were mistakes which had not been seen previously.
Blunder No.1 came in 31 minutes when Thomas Brolin crossed from the
right. Kennet Andersson went for the ball and seemed to get a touch as
it went on towards the far post. Twenty-year-old Malmo stroker Jorgen
Pettersson was there alone, unmarked and able to shoot low into the net
as the Scotland defence watched helplessly.
Blunder No.2 arrived four minutes afterwards when Stefan Schwarz shot
from almost 30 yards. There was little power behind his try but somehow
veteran keeper Jim Leighton, whose heroics have helped guide Scotland to
the European finals, seemed to lose sight of the ball which bounced over
the line with the Hibs man stranded.
Until then the Scots had looked comfortable. Indeed, there were times
when it looked as if they might have taken the lead.
On the half-hour mark, for example, before these four tragic minutes,
John Collins set up a chance for Alan McLaren whose drive went just wide
of a post.
However, there were always signs that the Swedes could strike swiftly
and decisively, but the Scottish defence ignored the warnings.
At half-time manager Brown made the changes he had promised with Billy
McKinlay and Eoin Jess replacing Craig Burley and John McGinlay, but it
was the Swedes who took control as the match restarted.
McLaren desperately headed away a cross from Brolin, whose probing
crosses always brought menace to the Scotland defence. Then, in 53
minutes, Leighton saved from Pettersson with his legs and Stewart
McKimmie headed the rebound just wide of his own post.
Two minutes after that the Scots had their best chance. Jess had a
shot blocked by the keeper and Mikael Nilsson sent the ball back to his
keeper and the Spanish referee awarded Scotland a free kick on the
six-yard line.
Every Swedish player was on the goal-line to stop the danger and a
shot from Gary McAllister was eventually blocked.
Leighton had another save from Pettersson and then, just short of the
hour mark, skipper McAllister was stretchered off following a late
tackle from Joachim Bjorklund. Darren Jackson replaced the Leeds United
star and soon afterwards manager Brown used all his substitutes with
Andy Goram appearing for Leighton and Pat Nevin taking over from John
Robertson.
Before the end Jackson was desperately close to giving Scotland a goal
that they deserved. He had a double chance in 80 minutes, with two
headers, one of which was blocked by the goalkeeper, and the other
cleared for a corner by a defender after a cross from Nevin had opened
things up.
The Scots did not get many breaks around the Swedish goal. There were
times when they might have benefited from the lapses in concentration
which their own men had had. The Swedes, however, were organised and
competent.
It was a defeat that Brown had not wanted. His hope, always, has been
to build confidence in the squad which he wants to take to the finals in
England.
Until last night the Scots, criticised though they may have been, had
been able to go seven games without defeat. The last time they had lost
was in Athens against Greece last December.
Yet against the Swedes, who have been left trailing in their group
behind Switzerland and Turkey, they were given a lesson -- one they must
take on board. They cannot allow these lapses of concentration to take
place again.
Last night they were punished for them. It cost them the match and may
have dented the confidence that Brown has been trying to build among his
players.
There is no doubt that the defence, until last night, had been the
most important part of the team, and the man, who have made the
difference between qualification for England and failure to do so.
SWEDEN -- B Andersson, Lucic, P Andersson, Bjorklund, Neilsson,
Schwarz, Alexandersson, Gudmundsson, Pettersson, K Andersson, Brolin.
Substitutes -- Ravelli, Erlingmark, Kamark, Landberg, Pringle.
SCOTLAND -- Leighton, McKimmie, Boyd, Calderwood, Hendry, McLaren,
Burley, Robertson, McGinlay, McAllister, Collins. Substitutes -- Goram,
McKinlay, Nevin, Jess, Jackson.
Referee -- Manuel Eijz Vega (Spain).

Stockholm
SCOTLAND skipper Gary McAllister was stretchered off in the second
half of Scotland's 2-0 defeat from Sweden in Stockholm last night and
looks set for a lengthy injury absence.
McAllister went down after a late challenge in the fifty-eighth minute
and afterwards manager Craig Brown said: ''His injury is serious. His
ankle ligaments are badly damaged and he will be out of Leeds United's
European game against PSV Eindhoven next week.
''We don't know exactly how long Gary will be out of action, but it is
a severe blow to him, and to us. To have him injured in a friendly is
particularly sore.
''I thought of taking him off at half-time because he had been
doubtful before the game. But he was anxious to play on and we were
happy to let him do so. His injury is a grievous disappointment to
everyone.''
The McAllister injury added to Scotland's misery as they slumped to
their first defeat this year. Said Brown: ''We lost concentration in the
first half for five minutes or so. We just seemed to switch off and
that's when Sweden scored their two goals.
''We made more chances than we normally do, but we suffered our old
failing in not being able to grasp our scoring opportunities.
''You cannot lose concentration the way we did against a team as
accomplished as the Swedes. You have to remember that they were third in
the world two years ago and that they have some marvellous young
players.''

Russia 2, Greece 0
SCOTLAND flew home from Stockholm last night still unsure of
qualification in the European Championship finals in England next
summer, writes Ken Gallacher.
The results around the Continent went in their favour. Certainly, they
are assured of second place in their own group after Russia's victory
over Greece in Moscow. But other games may still affect the Scots'
position.
However, manager Craig Brown insisted: ''I am happy right now to say
that we will qualify without needing a play-off. France defeated
Romania, Poland won against Slovakia, and Spain drew in Denmark, and all
these results are favourable towards our cause.
''We will have to look at all the groups, but I am happy to accept
that we will be in England without having to face a play-off match at
Anfield in December.''
The Scots have one more game to play, against San Marino at Hampden
next month, but Brown grinned happily: ''That game does not matter at
all now.
''I think that the opening victory we had in Helsinki against Finland
and the two draws against Russia have been enough to give us the edge in
our group.''
Cheered on by President Boris Yeltsin, Viktor Onopko scored the
decisive goal for Russia in the seventy-first minute.
The Greeks contributed to their own downfall with an own goal in the
thirty-sixth minute. Keeper Nikos Mihopulos moved out to parry a cross
from Yuri Kovtun, but the ball hit defender Marinos Ouzunigis on the leg
and flew into the net.
Greece equalised after 64 minutes through a header by Yotis
Tsaluhidis, but seven minutes later Onopko put the Russians ahead during
a goalmouth skirmish.

SEAN Sweeney, the Airdrie central defender, has been banned from
Saturday's Division 1 match against Clydebank following the recent ''no
handshake'' row.
Sweeney was cautioned during Saturday's defeat by St Johnstone at
McDiarmid Park, then, as the teams left the pitch after the final
whistle, Sweeney refused to shake hands with linesman Stuart Dougal.
The player was called to the referee's room, where match official
Martin Clark told Sweeney he would be reported for ungentlemanly
conduct.
Airdrie have protested to the SFA about one of the officials, but the
SFA have confirmed, after referee Clark's report was received, that the
double booking was being treated as an ordering off.

* BULGARIA were surprised in their European Championship, Group 7
match in Tbilisi last night when they were beaten 2-1 by Georgia, a
result which dents Bulgaria's hopes of finishing top of the section.
Previously unbeaten Bulgaria were without many key defenders and
struggled from the moment Arveladze gave the home side a first-minute
lead.
Georgy Kinkladze scored from a penalty after 48 minutes, with Hristo
Stoichkov scoring a consolation goal in the last minute for Buglaria.
In Bratislava, Slovakia ended Poland's faint hopes of qualifiying for
next summer's finals when they defeated them 4-1 in a Group 1 qualifier,
while in the same group, France surprised their hosts Romania by winning
3-1 in Bucharest.
This success puts the French to within two points of Romania with just
one match remaining.

SHINTY
TWO derbies dominate the action in shinty's Premier league this
weekend, with the match between the two Oban sides starting early to
accommodate a wedding.
The Oban teams are joint bottom of the new league, with just one point
each and the half-way point just a fortnight away. Camanachd's form has
been dismal and their cause is further weakened by the continued absence
of Alec MacVicar through suspension, but at least they have Dave McCuish
and Fraser Inglis back in contention.
A victory over Lorne in this derby, which starts at 11.30, may be just
the tonic Camanachd need.
At Kingussie, the league leaders entertain local rivals Newtonmore,
who have struggled to find any semblance of form this season. 'More have
scored just three goals in their four league matches and have conceded
three. This leaves them just a point off the bottom of the table with
two points.
Kingussie, on the other hand, give the impression of coasting towards
their first national league title. They accounted for Fort William
easily last weekend and must be odds on to score a comfortable victory
in the match of the day.

FIFE Flyers romped into the quarter-finals of the Benson &amp; Hedges Cup,
but in the league it has been a completely different story.
They have failed to collect a point from their opening three games
and, even more worrying, have conceded 39 goals with only 18 in reply.
This weekend they hope to recover their form, when they meet Newcastle
back-to-back for a place in the semi-finals of the cup. Newcastle have
taken two points from their first two league outings, but were beaten
home and away by Flyers in the round robin qualifier.

DUNCAN Shearer yesterday played down his chances of making Scotland's
Euro '96 squad next summer -- despite scoring in the B side's 2-1
victory over Sweden in Stockholm on Tuesday night.
The 33-year-old Aberdeen striker admitted later: ''I still don't think
I will be in England next year if we qualify.'' Then he claimed he
cannot be sure of when he will next start a game for Aberdeen.
''I am pleased that I scored, because I want manager Craig Brown and
the strikers in our senior squad to know I am ready to do a job if
asked. But I have a real battle on my hands getting a game for Aberdeen
at the moment.''
Ironically, Tuesday's outing was capped for Shearer by being given the
Scotland B captaincy. He has been confined to the bench at Pittodrie
this season as manager Roy Aitken keeps faith with in-form strikers
Scott Booth and Billy Dodds.
''I simply don't have a case to go in and see Roy Aitken at the
moment,'' he said. ''The two guys who are playing at the moment have
been exceptional for Aberdeen so far this season. But scoring in Sweden
is another reminder from me to Roy and I'm delighted with that.
''I was also pleased that I played for almost 80 minutes, because it's
a big difference stepping up to B international level from reserve team
football.''
Brown, of course, has already used Shearer in Scotland's Group 8
qualifying campaign, and a couple of other fringe candidates staked
their claim in the Rasunda stadium. Midfielders Scott Gemmill
(Nottingham Forest) and Paul Telfer (Coventry) impressed asistant
managers Murdo MacLeod and Tommy Burns as a late winner from substitute
Tom Brown, of Kilmarnock, ensured victory.
''It was a good team performance and it was great to see us passing
the ball so well away from home in Europe,'' said MacLeod. Hibernian's
Kevin Harper, who is just 19, also looked a bright prospect when he came
on as a subtitute in the second half.
Now Scotland could include more B games in their forthcoming programme
with, possibly, one in Denmark next April.
* BP Youth Cup holders Rangers will face Highland opposition when they
open their defence of the trophy. Rangers have a home tie against Elgin

Republic of Ireland 2
Latvia 1
TWO goals from veteran striker John Aldridge enabled the Republic to
hang on for a nail-biting win in Dublin last night and keep their
European Championship qualifying hopes flickering.
It was a tension-filled night for Jack Charlton and his nervous team
who were living on their nerves in the last 12 minutes after Latvian
striker Vitas Rimkus scored.
It was a match they simply had to win to have any chance of
qualification, and Charlton may well have given uup the job had they not
knocked over the improving Baltic State side, but it took the predatory
instincts and cool nerve of 37-year-old Aldridge to break the deadlock
and easy the anxiety.
Nervous and tight, the Irish showed little sign of breaking down the
Latvians' composed resistance.
Aldridge had a shot blocked from six yards and Niall Quinn's header
was smothered at the foot of a post by keeper Oleg Karaveyevs, but that
was the sum total of Ireland's first-half threat.
Just after the hour, though, the heaven-sent opportunity of a penalty
was planted at Aldridge's feet. Sweeper Igor Stepanovs tripped Steve
Staunton as the midfielder raced onto a knock-down by Quinn. Aldridge
waited for the crowd noise to die down before blasting his shot into the
net.
Three minutes later, he landed the second goal which should have
settled everything with a flying header from a Staunton free kick.
Aldridge spurned the chance of a hat trick when he lost control
running through the middle behind the Latvian defence just six minutes
later, but by the time he was substituted 10 minutes from the end, he
had long become once more the darling of the home crowd.
Dropped from the previous two games, both lost to Austria, he came
back in typical style and is now just one goal short of Frank
Stapelton's Irish scoring record of 20.
Then a mix-up in the Irish defence handed Rimkus the opportunity to
slot a soft shot beyond stranded keeper Alan Kelly.
Ireland had to thank Kelly for an earlier save when he touched Mikhail
Zemlinski's great 20-yard shot against the bar and over.
The final whistle finally stopped the nail-biting but Ireland still
have to wait on other results to know their qualifying fate.
Liechtenstein 0
Northern Ireland 4
JIMMY Quinn pleaded for another chance to crack Northern Ireland's
goalscoring record after this victory in Liechtenstein. His strike after
55 minutes took him to 12 goals in 45 international appearances -- just
one short of Colin Clarke's all-time record.
''I would love to be involved against Austria next month,'' said
Quinn. ''I was getting annoyed because I didn't have that many crosses
where I could attack the ball before the goal came.
Quinn's goal was his team's third, following Michael O'Neill's opener
and Gerry McMahon's strike. Phil Gray completed the rout.
Manager Bryan Hamilton said: ''In the first-half here we didn't play
well. I don't really know why, they probably tried too hard. When the
second goal went in we improved and overall I have got to be pleased.''
* COCA-Cola have denied they are to withdraw sponsorship of the League

Wales 1, Germany 2
JURGEN Klinsmann's thirty-second international goal was enough to rob
Wales of what would have been a deserved point after a battling display
in a European Championship, Group 7 match in Cardiff last night.
Kit Symons' first international goal for Wales after 78 minutes, a
deflected header, looked to have got Neville Southall out of jail after
the Goodison man had gifted substitute Stefan Kuntz a goal with his
first touch three minutes earlier.
Yet almost before the cheers of the 25,000 crowd in the Arms Park had
died the German skipper swooped to put his side level on points with
group leaders Bulgaria and leave the Welsh above only Moldova.
Germany were buoyant after their recent big win over Moldova and
Bulgaria's defeat in Georgia, and they started in menacing mood.
Matthias Sammer fired inches wide when he moved forward to join the
attack after three minutes and then Southall -- for time-wasting -- and
Dean Saunders were booked.
However, Wales were in no mood to roll over and in 14 minutes Saunders
should have put them ahead. The striker had taken his early chance to
earn the Welsh a draw in Dusseldorf in April, but when Ryan Giggs
created an opening with a chip, Saunders could only head over.
Mark Pembridge's persistence might have have caused a dream debut for
Swansea's Stephen Jenkins, who rose well to meet the Sheffield Wednesday
midfielder's left-wing cross, but he could not find the target.
Then neat interplay involving Giggs, Melville, and Gary Speed appeared
to have opened up the Germans, although a flag cut short the excitement
before Andreas Kopke saved the Leeds player's strike.
Paul Mardon replaced Jenkins with 19 minutes left but it was the
German change two minutes later, Kuntz replacing Herrlich, which was to
prove crucial.
There seemed little danger when Ziege floated in a free-kick 15
minutes from time, but Southall tried to kick clear, missed, and turned
in disbelief to watch Kuntz turn the ball home.
''We gave away two terrible goals and the first one cost us the
game,'' said Southall. ''That's got to be down to me. It was up to the
older lads to set an example, but we haven't done that.''
However, within three minutes Wales were level. Pembridge knocked in a
corner from the right and Symons rose to head towards goal, the
deflection off Helmer taking the ball past Kopke.
But two minutes later, Klinsmann shattered home hopes. Steffen Freund
crossed from the right and the skipper timed his near-post run to
perfection, beating Southall to head home and reel away in triumph.

ATHLETICS
SCOTLAND have decided against hosting what would have been their last
full athletics international, it was revealed yesterday.
During the summer, Scotland were forced to renege on a promise to
stage the third match in a series against Israel, Turkey, and Wales
because of lack of sponsorship. The Welsh agreed to rescue the event,
but despite confidence that they would find a backer, failed to do so,
and Israel, without any prior warning, did not appear.
The Scottish Athletic Federation immediately launched a hunt for a
backer to ensure there was no repetition next summer. But before flying
to today's international fixture congress in Paris, SAF representative
Helen Spankie confirmed the international will not take place.
''I cannot see this match going ahead,'' said Spankie. ''I cannot
approach the other countries when we simply do not have the funds
(around #24,000) to stage the meeting. We did have a provisional date,
June 8 and 9, but again we have failed to find a sponsor.''
Scotland have already accepted hospitality at earlier meetings, in Tel
Aviv, Istanbul, and Cardiff, and are now the only ever-present nation
not to return the compliment. This has undertones of the era during the
sixties, seventies and early eighties, when Scottish cross-country
accepted team and individual invitations to races on the Continent but
never reciprocated. Overseas invitations to Scots are now as rare as
clean vests after a muddy cross-country event.
SAF secretary Bob Greenoak said: ''It is very disappointing to have to
cancel for the second year, but the sport is in very straitened
circumstances, and it is up to track and field how they spend their
budget.''
The federation have already decided not to send full teams to future
matches. In many events, such as men's pole vault and triple jump, for
example, Scottish performers are felt unworthy of inclusion, with the
resources spent on such competitors being wasted.
''The decision not to hold this fixture is in line with that policy,''
added Greenoak. ''The budget in future will be geared towards providing
competitive opportunities for elite performance management group
athletes, and much smaller matches.''

<HEADLINE>Venables not upset after a dreary draw</HEADLINE>

Norway 0, England 0
TERRY Venables, the England manager, remained defiant last night after
his dreary side headed back from Oslo with just a draw.
''I think we would have been pleased with that result last time,'' he
said of the 0-0 draw, which only partially avenged Graham Taylor's World
Cup defeat in 1993.
''You've got to talk about entertainment, I've got to talk about
results as well as entertainment, and that's the difficult thing to do.
But I'm trying to get both.
''As the game went on I couldn't see us losing. We got stronger, they
didn't make any chances and, if anyone was going to win, it was going to
be us. Perhaps a draw was a fair result.
''But I was pleased. It was a difficult type of game. If we were
trying to qualify for the World Cup or Europeans, you would be pleased
with that. They are the sort of results you need to get.
''Norway were making the running and by now people must realise, if
you look at the past, that if you start chasing the game in places like
this, you will leave gaps and get beaten. We didn't get beaten against
the sixth best team in the world, who have not lost at home for four
years.''
Venables' isolationist policy condemned Alan Shearer to another game
without a goal, a drought which now stretches to 733 minutes.
With no-one else coming close, England's attack less than hurtful just
eight months away from the start of the European Championship they host
and hope to win.
England sent on Teddy Sheringham for the last 22 minutes, but as
Venables had not even included Newcastle's in-form Les Ferdinand on his
bench, serious questions will be asked of the tactics.
* BP Youth Cup holders Rangers will face Highland opposition when they
open their defence of the trophy. Rangers have a home tie against Elgin
City in the third round of the tournament. Draw:
Stirling Albion v Dundee United, Aberdeen v Forfar, Queen's Park v St
Johnstone, Airdrie v St Mirren, Annan v Kilmarnock, Partick Thistle v
Buckie or Fort William, Stenhousemuir v Raith Rovers, Motherwell v
Huntly, Berwick v Hamilton, Rangers v Elgin City, Clydebank v Hibernian,
Falkirk v Ross County, Clyde v Celtic, Dundee v Fraserburgh, Arbroath v
Hearts, Dunfermline v Morton. Ties to be played before November 12.

FRANCE upset Group 1 leaders Romania 3-1 in Bucharest yesterday to
give themselves an excellent chance of qualifying for the European
Championship finals.
Nantes' Christian Karembeu put France ahead on the half hour when he
stormed into the area to head a Zinedine Zidane cross past Romania's
goalkeeper Bogdan Stelea then follow up by ramming the ball home with
his left boot. Midfielder Youri Djorkaeff increased France's lead three
minutes before the interval when he netted the rebound after Stelea
parried a shot from Christophe Dugarry.
Steaua Bucharest striker Marius Lacatus pulled one back for Romania
with a fine solo effort in 52 minutes before Zidane put the result
beyond the Romanians in 72 minutes.
Romania now need to win their final match away to Slovakia on November
15 and hope that France lose at home to Israel on the same night, to
ensure they finish in first place and gain automatic entry to the
finals.
* SWITZERLAND secured their first ever slot in the European
Championship finals with a stylish 3-0 home win against Hungary.
Kubilay Tuerkilmaz scored in the first half and Bayern Munich's Ciri
Sforza netted a brilliant free kick seven minutes into the second-half.
The two men were the undisputed stars on the field. Christophe Ohrel,
who plays for the French side St Etienne, made it three six minutes
before the end.
* DENMARK and Spain drew 1-1 in Copenhagen yesterday in a match that
grew in intensity for 75 minutes, but then fizzled as the teams realised
that the draw was likely to qualify both nations for the finals.
Fernando Hierro put Spain in the lead in 16 minutes from a
controversial penalty. A minute into the second half, Michael Laudrup on
a counter-attack found Kim Vilfort, who equalised.
* MARK Overmars scored three second-half goals as Holland overcame a
slow start to romp to a 4-0 victory at Malta and maintain their chance
of qualifying. Clarence Seedorf added the fourth 10 minutes from the
end.
The Dutch are a point behind second-placed Czech Republic, who have an
easier final Group 5 game. The Czechs host Luxemburg while Holland are
at home to Norway.
* AUSTRIA and Portugal battled to a 1-1 draw in Vienna in a Group 6
match. Portugal could have clinched top spot, but seemed content to
settle for a tie which left the Austrians third behind behind Portugal
and Ireland.
Peter Stoeger opened the scoring in 21 minutes, but Paulinho Santos
equalised for the visitors in 49 minutes.

SCOTLAND second row Shade Munro's job, as some of you know, is to
spread rugby to areas more normally associated with other pursuits,
among them football and the darker arts of inner-city life.
His education has been rapid. Taking a warm-up recently he was stopped
by one young lad barely 10 years old and asked: ''Hey, mister, when do
we get to punch?'' This was followed by: ''Have you ever punched
anybody, big man?'' Needless to say Munro lied with his reply. He said
''yes''.
Munro is not too sure whether he is more scared of them than they are
of him, but it's a close-run thing. At the same session he asked the
kids to stretch by touching their toes, only to be mocked by an uncouth
youth who had the assembled throng in stitches when he shouted out at
the top of his voice: ''Aw naw, mister . . . no' another medical!''
In Irvine he noted that one young chap hadn't fully grasped the
tackling rules in New Image rugby which stipulate that a defender should
grasp an attacker around the waist. The boy was very definitely
confused. ''Now look,'' said Munro as patiently and educationally as he
could, ''if someone was running towards you with the ball what would you
do?''
''Easy, big man,'' said our 10-year-old hero. ''I'd stick the nut
right on him good and proper.''
Maybe not such a bad idea after all. Ah yes, and who said teaching the
beautiful game was easy.
* IT'S a well-accepted fact that the Craig boys, Mark, Richie and
James, have had to swallow hard on re-entering the Lions' den at West of
Scotland after their unhappy sojourn into the Borders with Hawick. I
hear that Richie and Mark were a nervous pair as they entered the
changing room of the West 2As on Saturday morning.
First, our duo were given some ceremonial 10p coins as a replacement
for the ''pieces of silver'' they were supposed to have gone to Hawick
for.
Next, a Parks of Hamilton brochure was thrust into Richie's pocket.
''What's that for?'' he asked.
''You said you had gone to Hawick because of a lack of coaches in
Glasgow,'' he was told. ''There are plenty of coaches in there.''
Cruel boys, very cruel.
* THE club the Craig boys left, Hawick, are having their own problems
just now, and of an unexpected kind. Hawick's boots are sponsored by
Mizuno, and the Japanese company are finding it hard to honour their
part of the contract with Andrew Barnes, son of Scotland
internationalist Ian, who just happens to take size 16s. Yes, size 16s
-- proof that Gavin Hastings doesn't have the biggest boot in Scotland.
And you know what they say . . . big feet, big heart. Or something
like that.
* I HEAR that our injured GHK friend Alan Watt was one of the first to
jump on to the scales at the Scottish forwards' get-together on Monday
at Murrayfield. Watt has a badly injured groin, but was nevertheless
keen to demonstrate that he has lost a great deal of weight recently.
He has lost weight, but it's only a pound. Alan Watt, I can officially
reveal, as Chick Young might say, weighs in at a mere 19st 3lb.
* THE Livingston rugby club is about to have a major new stadium built
for it by the Livingston Development Corporation. The rugby club, home
to former sprinter Elliot Bunney and which has had to sit by and watch
as the football club received a brand new stadium in the town, put
pressure on the body to do the same for rugby.
Jim Pollock, chief executive of the LDC, confirmed that plans are well
advanced. ''This isn't for printing in your paper, but I'm a round ball
man,'' said Jim, also an honorary member of the rugby club. Tough Jim.
''I have had the exercise costed, and I have gone back to the rugby
club with plans of a development for them to see if that would suit them
and be in line with their expectations. I will also be trying to obtain
other sources of money for the project which I do believe is
important.''
The football stadium, home to Jim Leishman's chappies, cost #4m. The
rugby stadium won't cost a tenth of that.
* AS Gerry McNee might himself say, exclusively, I can reveal that
Walter Malcolm, the former GHK captain who was fundamental to attracting
new coach Hugh Campbell to the club, is considering moving to Hutchesons
Aloysians to play some fun rugby in semi-retirement and help former
British Lion Sandy Carmichael with the coaching duties at the ambitious
Netherauldhouse club.
Malcolm has played two games this season as second row for the GHK
seconds, which is hardly ideal for someone so very short of 6ft 6ins.
''Colin Mainds, the president, is a very good friend of mine, and he
has been talking to me for a long time to see if I would go down and
play there. I must say I am considering it very strongly,'' said
Malcolm. ''I played for one of their teams a few weeks back, and I
enjoyed it.''
It's always good to be friends with a surgeon -- Mainds is and Walter
has a few operable injuries and he needs the odd pain-killing jag -- but
I also saw him with the former male model, and now employment guru,
Dougie Kinnaird on Saturday night.
Mind you, that was back in the days when Carol Smillie was also doing
a spot of the modelling. Hang on, Carol's a Hutchie person too. So
that's the attraction. Come on Walter, be honest with your public. I
knew you didn't fancy Colin Mainds all that much.
* KEVIN McKenzie, the Stirling County and Scotland hooker who left the
field during his club's match with Melrose last Saturday, will be out of
rugby for a month with knee ligament damage.
Martin Scott, the No.3 hooker, is also injured. With the Western
Samoans arriving soon, could an SOS be sent to Kenny Milne?

SCHOOLS RUGBY
FOR all that rugby has made its impression on the nation, there
remains large swathes of the young population in Scotland as yet
untouched by the sport. And especially so in Glasgow, where, according
to Ken McEwan, the city's rugby youth development officer, only six out
of the 44 state schools now offer rugby in the curriculum.
If that sounds like confirmation that the sleeping giant of Glasgow
rugby has not yet been roused from eternal slumber, then at least there
is some good news emanating from the state sector. Four schools in
Glasgow -- Cleveden Secondary, St Mungos, Holyrood Secondary and
Eastbank Academy -- have recently started offering after-school rugby.
''It is a slow revival,'' claims McEwan, who is convinced that in time
there will be a growth of rugby in this age group. ''But traditional
methods will not work,'' he adds, and he should know having taught
physical education in a number of Glasgow schools before becoming head
of PE at Perth High School and then taking up his current post.
''There are just too many barriers in the way of resurrecting
extra-curricular rugby as we knew it in the past,'' says McEwan, who
adds that a vital way forward is to promote the game extensively in
primary schools in the shape of New Image rugby. ''If primary children
arrive in secondary schools with rugby skills and a desire to play the
game then a demand is created. But the important step is for secondary
schools to establish links with local clubs.''
McEwan cites the rapport between Eastwood District Schools and Glasgow
Southern as a prime example, and newcomers Holyrood have achieved such a
link with Cartha Queens Park.
''Further help comes from Glasgow City Council which lends financial
support to youth-committed clubs through their Top Clubs scheme,'' says
McEwan, who believes that these links with schools are essential to tap
what he considers to be a huge potential of talent in Glasgow.
Having advocated the club link for a number of state schools, McEwan
would now like to see regular Saturday matches between club under-18
teams and the independent schools. ''That is the route to the future,''
he says.
That too could at least prod the sleeping giant.

DEAN Robertson must wait to find out if he has a start in the Volvo
Masters at Valderrama on October 26 to 29. The field is restricted to
the top 50 in the Volvo Order of Merit, and the 25-year-old Scot is
third reserve at No.53.
American Fred Couples has until today to accept an invitation. Should
he decline, the Gleddoch assistant will become second reserve. If Seve
Ballesteros continues to rest, that would take him even nearer.
The positions of those who do not play at Valderrama are now final.
Gary Orr, Gordon Brand Jr, Paul Lawrie, Ross Drummond, and Stephen
McAllister have ensured category 11a cards by finishing in the top 120.
Adam Hunter, winner of the Portuguese Open, has a three-year exemption
in category 5, as has Jersey Open champion Andrew Oldcorn.
Brian Marchbank, at No.146, needs to visit the final qualifying school
to improve on his category 13 ranking. At No.165, Mike Miller must first
pre-qualify. Scottish placings:
1, S Torrance, #630,481; 2, C Montgomerie #626,651; 30, A Coltart
#141,359; 34, S Lyle #136,644; 35, A Oldcorn #135,269; 53, D Robertson

LUCINDA Russell continued on her winning way at Wetherby yesterday
when Vavasir landed the novices' handicap.
This was the trainer's fourth success in her first season and she is
now only one behind Peter Monteith in The Herald Scottish Trainers'
Championship.
Peter Niven took Vavasir into the lead from the start, and although
they were challenged by Peruvian Gale and Ask for Barney -- who ran out
at the last -- the Scottish horse ran on well.
He came home almost alone with the runner-up, Lockerbie-trained
Kushdalay, many lengths behind.
Russell has had a fantastic start to her career as a trainer. Her four
winners have come from only six runner in just three weeks.

SPECTATORS at Wentworth and -- since this event is not restricted to a
satellite channel -- viewers on BBC will from today begin the belated
chance of appreciating the golf of four members of the victorious Ryder
Cup team as they compete in the #650,000 Toyota World Matchplay
championship.
The fact that two of them, Sam Torrance and Bernhard Langer, meet in
the first round adds spice to the menu. Colin Montgomerie's game against
the young American, David Duval, and Costantino Rocca's encounter with
Fiji's Vijay Singh, also will have greater curiosity value than is
immediately obvious when Lee Janzen faces Katsuyoshi Tomori.
Just as Montgomerie's performance on the European Order of Merit has
never regressed, so in this event, in his three previous appearances, he
has been beaten in the second round, the semi-final, and last year, by
Ernie Els, in the final. Ultimate success this time may be compromised
by injury.
Montgomerie continues to experience pain in his left wrist at the top
of the backswing, which goes beyond the parallel when he plays the No.7
iron up to the driver. However, he hopes that intensive treatment three
times every day will prove effective this week and next at the Dunhill
Cup at St Andrews. After that comes the Volvo Masters which will decide
the winner of this year's order of merit title duel between himself,
Torrance, and Langer.
Montgomerie attributes his rare submission to injury to ''more
practice as I changed to cock my wrists more on the backswing with
heavier clubs.'' He concedes that ideally he should, on his doctor's
advice, take a complete rest. But he also has a busy post-season
programme of overseas tournaments which he intends to fulfil and only
then take of January, when his wife is expecting their second child, and
most of February.
Admitting that he knows little of Duval, who in 1991 was on the
American Walker Cup team and a semi-finalist in the Amateur
Championship, Montgomerie accepts that he must be a talented player to
be currently in tenth place on the US Tour money list in his first
season. However, Montgomerie notes: ''This is his first experience of
the West course and it's not mine.
''I have the advantage there,'' he added. ''The course (6957 yards) is
playing 10 to 15 yards longer than at the PGA championship in May, the
rough is up, and the greens are soft. The only problem is that when
expectations of one golfer are greater than of another, he sometimes
doesn't play as well.''
Should Montgomerie prevail, he would then face Steve Elkington, who
beat him in a play-off for the US PGA title in August and is one of the
four players seeded into the second round along with Els, Nick Price,
ranked second in the world, and Masters champion Ben Crenshaw.
Elkington disclosed yesterday that he had faxed Montgomerie after his
victory in Los Angeles to tell him: ''Your deserved the title as much as
I did and I hope you win one as well.'' To beat Elkington tomorrow would
surely be satisfying, but still no substitute for a major championship.
Incidentally, because of flight problems in the USA, Crenshaw is not
due to arrive until this morning, 24 hours behind schedule -- hardly the
best preparation for one who will be making his fifth appearance in the
championship but his first for nine years.
If Duval is an unknown quantity, Langer represents formidable
opposition for Torrance -- twice a beaten finalist, winner this year of
the PGA title for the second time over the course, and winner and
runner-up in his last two tournaments, in the immediate aftermath of the
draining effect of the Ryder Cup's melodramatic finish.
All thoughts of the season's climax in a fortnight's time will surely
be remote from these players' minds as they alttempt to take the initial
step towards winning the #170,000 first prize.
Janzen, an underestimated player, will not be inclined to treat
Tomori, Japan's matchplay champion, cavalierly. The outcome of Rocca's
game against Singh may depend on which is the less volatile on the day.
Today's tee-off times:
8.15am and 12.30pm -- L Janzen (USA) v K Tomori (Japan). Winner to
play E Els (S Africa).
8.30 and 12.45 -- S Torrance (GB) v B Langer (Germany). Winner to play
N Price (Zimbabwe).
8.45 and 1.00 -- C Montgomerie (GB) v D Duval (USA). Winner to play S
Elkington (Australia).
9.00 and 1.15 -- C Rocca (Italy) v V Singh (Fiji). Winner to play B
Crenshaw (USA).

* There is a chain of thought that believes when a player moves from
the major to minor leagues in American football his career is as good as
over. But as STEVE LIVINGSTONE found out, this is not always the case.
IN the high-pressure world of American sports, there is only one fate
worse than suffering a career-ending injury and that is being sent to
play in the Minors.
However, if former Scottish Claymores defensive end Michael Brandon is
anything to go by, there is evidence that life exist beyond the Minors.
Six months ago, Brandon was playing for the Claymores in what some
regard as gridiron's ''Minor League,'' in front of 9000 enthusiasts as
his team struggled to post a 2-8 record in its inaugural World League
season.
On Sunday Brandon will play at the Hoosier Dome in Indianapolis in
front of 61,000 largely hostile fans of the home team, Colts, as well as
an estimated TV audience of many millions and, along with San Francisco
49ers team-mates Steve Young, Jerry Rice, and Ken Norton, will try to
advance the Super Bowl champions' 4-1 standing.
Brandon has made it to the big time.
Perhaps the equivalent of a left back for Montrose being given a call
by AC Milan for a trial and then, the following week, being signed for
the season, Mike Brandon has defied the odds. And the man previously
dropped from two NFL teams -- the Colts in 1993 and the Arizona
Cardinals in 1994 -- effectively banishing him to the limbo of the World
League, playing in Scotland has resurrected his professional career.
As he prepared with the 49ers at their state-of-the-art, 11-acre
training centre, Brandon explained how coming to Edinburgh had landed
him the spot on the world champions' roster.
''Some people say once you go to Europe you're finished, but I think
I've disproved that,'' said Brandon. ''Going to the World League helped
me to get my mind back into football -- it helped me to prepare mentally
and to get back into the kind of shape I needed to be in to play in the
NFL.''
Now as a back-up defensive lineman, Brandon's job is to fill in for
the superstars of the San Francisco defence, taking orders from
defensive captain Ken Norton Jr, son of the boxing legend.
Brandon lays credit for his presence in San Francisco and his resolve
to continue pushing for more with the Claymores' coaching staff, and it
is no coincidence that five of his Murrayfield team-mates now are also
in similar positions, filling roster spots on one of the 30 teams in the
NFL.
Former Claymores quarterback Matt Blundin now is at Kansas City
Chiefs, while Rodney Thomas and Jocelyn Borgella play as defensive backs
on the Houston Oilers and Detroit Lions.
Indeed, a friend of Brandon's, Brian Jones, who led the Claymores
defence from the middle linebacker position, is filling more than a
roster spot in New Orleans, as a first-team starter in that same
position with the Saints.
Brandon has no doubts as to why players from the Claymores have been
so successful in graduating to the NFL.
''Playing with the Claymores, I was able to work on my technique. I
had great coaches there in Jim Criner and the defensive line coach Bill
Dutton -- he was excellent -- and I feel we developed a good defence
despite our record.
Good news for Claymores fans next season is that Criner and Dutton
will continue and Brandon's testimony will add weight to the argument
that the World League is more than just a huge marketing ploy aimed at
helping its owners, Rupert Murdoch through his Fox broadcasting network
and the NFL, sell advertising across Europe.
His experience is proof that the European venture can provide a window
of opportunity into the NFL. ''One of the reasons I went to Scotland was
to get another shot at the NFL,'' said Brandon. ''I'm now playing with
the world champions.
''I believe the Claymores gave me the edge to make it and that's
something the 49ers must have spotted.''
For the detractors, Brandon had a personal message. ''I don't think
you can compare the situation in Scotland to that of the NFL or the
49ers,'' he said. ''The World League is still trying to establish itself
-- it's a different kind of league with its own merits and given a few
years it will be a great league.
His words were echoed by 49ers defensive captain Norton, a two-time
Super Bowl winner with the Dallas Cowboys and now with the 49ers, who
has helped Brandon fit into San Francisco's system.
''For guys like Michael, the World League has provided a second chance
to make it here in the NFL, said Norton. ''It's also a good thing for
the coaches who can also pick up on anyone who has been missed or who
just needed a little time to develop.
''I think Mike falls into that category. We're all very excited about
him here. Early on, he might not have been expected to make the team,
but he battled hard and showed a lot of spirit to beat the odds.''
Fellow lineman Dana Stubblefield also had praise for the former
Claymore. ''He's got the potential to start,'' said Stubblefield.
''Obviously, he's going to have to beat some good players out -- and
I'll be doing my best to try and stop that happening -- but if he keeps
progressing, who knows?''
No matter what happens to Brandon in the dog-eat-dog world of the NFL
it seems he had already turned his minor detour into a major success and
in the process brought credibility to the existence and standing of
professional American football in Scotland.
* THE Claymores have signed Jim Sochar as their new offensive coaching
coordinator. Head coach Criner has recruited Sochar, who made his
reputation at UC Davis in America, to add to his new backroom team which
also includes Ray Willsey, formerly with Frankfurt Galaxy, as defensive
coordinator.
''We will run the same offense made famous by the San Fransisco 49ers
under coach Bill Walsh,'' said Criner.

PLACES in the Britain and Ireland team to defend the Curtis Cup
against the United States at Killarney in August of next year look like
being hard to come by.
No fewer than five of the eight-strong side which held their hosts to
a tie in 1994 are included in the training squad announced yesterday's
by the Ladies' Golf Union. Among them are Scots Mhairi McKay and Janice
Moodie, both currently attending college in California.
The full squad of 15 is:
Fiona Brown (Heswall), Lisa Dermott (Royal Liverpool), Emma Duggleby
(Malton and Norton), Emma Fields (Falmouth), Julie Hall (Felixstowe
Ferry), Rebecca Hudson (Wheatley), Hazel Kavanagh (Grange), Mhairi McKay
(Turnberry), Janice Moodie (Windyhill), Lesley Nicholson (Haddington),

RUGBY:
THE Scottish rugby equivalent of the magnificent seven, in a quest to
hone sharpshooting abilities to match, is to receive individual
goal-kicking tuition from former coach and Scotland scrum half and
goal-kicker Dougie Morgan.
The seven -- Craig Chalmers, Kenny Logan, Graham Shiel, Gregor
Townsend, Michael Dods, Rowen Shepherd, and Stuart Laing -- are all
members of the national squad and they are also to be encouraged, with
their club's agreement, to take on regular Saturday afternoon kicking
duties.
Telfer said: ''The retiral of Gavin Hastings has left a goal-kicking
void in the national side and that aspect of play is now so crucial
that, in addition to all of the other work that we do, we have to look
at this area in a specific sense.''
Morgan, who retired as Scotland coach after the World Cup, said that
consistency was the key and that could only be achieved through regular
practice.
''Sadly, I don't think that players practice goal-kicking enough. The
other problem is that of the players in the national squad too few of
them are regular goal-kickers for their clubs. There is no real
substitute to kicking goals regularly in a match situation.
''A consistent goal-kicker, like the All Black, Grant Fox, whose
coaching video we will also be using, is absolutely essential these
days. It's not just a case of turning a five-point try into a
seven-point try. So many games are won and lost on penalties these days
that you really cannot afford to go into a game without a regular and
consistently successful goal-kicker,'' he said.
* HERIOT'S have had to drop Stuart Lang from their team to play
against Melrose on Saturday as they have been tied up in the Scottish
Rugby Union's red tape.
Lang, the full back who joined Heriot's after a game for Kelso last
month, made a try-scoring debut for the Goldenacre club in the defeat by
Boroughmuir last week. But he should not have played in that match
because he had not fulfilled the week's ''lie-over'' that is decreed in
the SRU's championship regulations for players moving between clubs.
Gregor Nicholson, the union's championship secretary, drew Heriot's
attention to their breach of the rules, and the SRU imposed a
retrospective ''lie-over.''
* MELROSE have been given planning permission for a #650,000 overhaul
at The Greenyards but Borders Regional Council planning committee has
said that it wants to see alternative floodlighting plans before work
can begin. In addition to floodlights, the scheme also calls for the
pitch to be relaid and moved four metres, the removal of a number of
trees, and the existing spectator embankment. There are also tentative
plans to install undersoil heating. There were a number of objectors to
the plans, including the neighbouring St Mary's School, but with the
floodlighting proviso the planners gave general approval this week.
* THE first monthly McEwan's Roadrunner award of a copious supply of
the sponsor's product, which goes to the club which has undergone the
most gruelling trip to fulfil an away fixture, is awarded to Aboyne RFC.
The Banchory-based club undertook a 500-mile round trip to Orkney for
the opening fixture in the North District League campaign.
The club couldn't afford the #3000 cost of chartering a plane and so
they set off at 5.45am to make the Scrabster-Stromness ferry. The ferry
was late and the connecting bus had gone. Two mini-buses were
commandeered for the 15-mile drive to the Orkney ground.
The game kicked off at 4pm and after nine hours of travelling the
club's 17-year-old No.8 Luke Taylor must have wondered if it had all
been worthwhile when he was taken off with concussion after only three
minutes.
Aboyne were defeated 91-0 and to add insult to injury they left their
kit and team strips on Orkney to be returned six days later just hours
before they were due to kick off the following Saturday.
The McEwan's Star of the Month award has gone to Sandra Kinnear of
Lismore RFC. She manages the club's women's team, set up Edinburgh's
first women's seven-a-side tournament, looks after club catering but
still finds time to coach at Craigmillar and Niddrie Schools in
Edinburgh.

CRAIG Everett regained some of his lost confidence yesterday when he
carded a seven-under-par 61 on the first day of the Mount Ellen
Assistants' tournament.
The Caldwell player has been trying to cure a loss of nerve this
season by leaving his driver at home. ''The only wood I carry now is a
No.3 and my game has really improved,'' he explained.
There was also a return to form for Glasgow's John Greaves, leaving
him in a strong position to retain the title. He is one behind in joint
second place with David Fleming, of Turnberry Hotel. Leading scores:
61 -- C Everett (Caldwell). 62 -- J Greaves (Glasgow); D Fleming

LAS VEGAS INVITATIONAL
LESS than 72 hours after recording the first victory of his career,
Brad Bryant continued his excellent form in the opening round of the Las
Vegas Invitational yesterday.
Bryant reeled off eight birdies for a seven-under-par 65 at Las Vegas
Country Club, one of three courses used in the marathon five-round
event, to trail leader Joe Ozaki by two strokes.
''I hit the ball as good today as I've probably ever hit it,'' said
Bryant, who won the Walt Disney World Classic by one stroke on Sunday,
in his 460th tournament on the PGA Tour.
''Things kept rolling. My swing held up. The Country Club played very
easily. There was no wind, and the fairways were on the fast side.''
Ozaki, playing on the Las Vegas Hilton course, reeled off six birdies
on the back nine, which he negotiated in 29 strokes. Leading scores (USA
unless stated):
63 -- J Ozaki (Japan).
64 -- K Fergus, C Parry (Australia), R Fehr, J Wilson.
65 -- B Bryant, D Martin, B Tway, S Jones.
66 -- C Rymer, M Calcavecchia, K Gibson, T Byrum, M Brooks, J Haas, C

TAKE a look across the autumn theatre season and it's difficult not to
reach an alarming conclusion. Unless the four months up to Christmas
represent a statistical blip, we can say with some certainty that the
Scottish play might not yet be buried, but it's lying on a cold stone
slab and the surgeon is having difficulty finding a pulse.
By that, I'm not saying that Scottish theatre is dead. Not at all --
it keeps on keeping on most interestingly, despite the persistently
pitiful levels of funding available to it. What has changed, though, is
it's now doing so without the help of its playwrights.
Correction. Playwrights can be useful to the modern Scottish stage in
one of three ways: they can have written a play that has been produced
at some point in the past; they can be signed up to write an adaptation
of an existing work; and they can be employed as the person in the
artistic team who perhaps didn't have the original idea, certainly
didn't have all the other ideas, but did get to write it all down.
Am I just feeding you another scare story? Well, to some extent I'm
deliberately stirring the waters in anticipation of this evening's
Tramway Discussion, produced in association with The Herald, which is
entitled ''The Death of the Play and the Rise of the Adaptation'' and
which sets out to determine whether this is the scenario that Scottish
theatre has in store for us.
Speaking at the free debate, which kicks off at 6pm, will be Tony
Graham, the artistic director of TAG Theatre Company, currently on tour
with an adaptation of Alasdair Gray's Lanark; John Harvey, who as well
as adapting Iain Banks' The Bridge, has scripted Benchtours'
semi-devised Limbo which opens at Tramway tonight; David Greig, the
Traverse Theatre's writer-in-residence who is not impartial to a spot of
devising work himself; and Victoria Beattie, director and performer with
young Glasgow multi-disciplinary company Crush, whose recent production
Bloodbirds -- A Recipe for Survival made use of film, music and sheer
physical stamina as much as anything that looked like a conventional
script.
So is the straight play really dead? I have to say it's difficult to
think otherwise when the number of new professionally produced Scottish
plays on show this autumn doesn't make the digits of your second hand
let alone double figures. The badly funded Fifth Estate has premiered
Stanley Eveling's The Albright Fellow, the equally shoestring Annexe
Theatre Company has just opened Cat and Mouse and the previously unheard
of Cars in Water is going to do something called The Immigrant Song next
month at the Arches. And that's it.
No-one could call this a prestigious list even if they included the
schools play that John McGrath has written for Theatre Workshop or
Benchtours' aforementioned Limbo.
I'm sure to have missed something out, but there's no doubt the point
stands that when you take into account the number of revivals (which
include Anne Marie di Mambro's Brothers of Thunder, Sue Glover's The
Seal Wife, John Binnie's A Little Older and Anthony Neilson's
Penetrator), and the number of adaptations (which include TAG's Lanark,
the Citizens' Trainspotting and Ebb Tide, Boilerhouse's No New Miracles,
the Tron's The Trick is to Keep Breathing, Dundee Rep's The White Bird
Passes and the Arches' Caligari), the new play is not just lesser
spotted it's all but extinct.
My point is not to condemn these productions. It is only partly to
complain about the neglect of our playwrights (after all, Di Mambro,
Glover, Binnie and Neilson are active and producing new work -- just not
this autumn). It is more to speculate about whether the conventional
input of the playwright can satisfy the creative needs of today's
theatre makers. It is to suggest -- in a Devil's advocate kind of a way
-- that playwrights had better start coming up with ways to rival the
imaginative scope of the novel unless they really want to be part of a
dying breed.
It is, after all, what many of the young practitioners in Tramway's
current Dark Lights season have been doing -- not exactly rejecting the
idea of a script, but not using one as their starting point either. The
reason, I think, that Process and Boilerhouse have used James Joyce and
Georg Buchner as springboards is not because they prefer novels to
plays, but because they prefer the theatrical freedom, the licence to
create, that adapting permits.
There are, of course, limitations to this approach. It is rare to find
either an adaptation or a devised drama that has the structural balance
and emotional control of a thought-through piece of writing. And many,
like the American drama critic John Mason Brown, feel that
''dramatisations as a rule prove more like sieves than containers for
the virtues of a book''. But for all this, isn't it time that
playwrights stopped complaining about being overlooked and addressed the
reasons their own writing is no longer proving an inspiration to actors,
directors and audiences?

SCOTLAND'S biggest property auction of the year will see some 79 lots
come under the hammer, consolidating the role of the roup north of the
Border. After a successful recent auction in Inverness, property
advisors Grimley are predicting a large turnout and keen bidding at
their next event which is being staged at Glasgow's Central Hotel on 2
November.
The lots are located throughout Scotland, from Thurso to New Cumnock
and including Great Cumbrae and Bute. Included in the sale are vacant
and tenanted residential properties; a hotel, pub, and disco in
Clydebank; a part-let Edinburgh office building with scope for
conversion to residential use; residential and industrial sites ranging
in size from 0.1 acre to 17 acres.
Also included in the sale is a number of retail and industrial
investments producing between #1750 and #35,000 per annum.
Shaun Vigers of Grimley said: ''This will be the biggest auction in
numerical and financial terms to be held in Scotland this year. The size
of the sale, and the presence of new corporate and property company
clients, points to the increasing acceptance of auction sales in
Scotland as a simple and cost effective alternative to conventional
marketing methods.''

THE Northern Retail Property Fund has gone shopping in a big way. In
an #11m deal the fund has acquired a basket of Scottish retail
properties located in towns such as Hawick (above), Airdrie, Dumfries,
Fort William, Oban and St Andrews.
The shops produce a current rental income of #751,140 per annum,
reflecting a net initial yield of close to 7% (a figure which will rise
to 8% on reversions). The portfolio was sold by Confederation Life UK as
part of a restructuring of its property holdings.
Managed by Pricoa Property Investment Management, the Northern Retail
Property Fund was set up to acquire retail properties in Scotland and
the north of England. The latest acquisition brings its total holdings
to some #15m of property, with a further #20m available for future
investments. Chesterton advised the purchaser on the acquisition, while
Confederation Investment Management acted for the vendors.
Standstill in rental sector
SCOTTISH rental levels stood still across all of the property sectors
during September, according to the Richard Ellis Scottish Monthly Index,
produced exclusively for The Herald.
The RESMI Index tracks monthly and annual changes in the total
returns, capital growth, and rental growth across Scotland's office,
retail, and industrial sectors. The current annual rental growth figures
for retail and industrial sectors remain at 1.2% and 0.6% respectively,
while offices increased to 0.2%.
Annual capital growth has remained positive, but at lower rates. The
annual capital growth for for all property slowed to 1.5%, while growth
in the office sector slowed to 0.6%. The retail sector saw a reduction
in annual growth from 4.1% to 3.3% and the industrial sector declined
from 1.9% to 0.9% over the last year.
The monthly capital growth figures improved only in the industrial
sector, while declining very slightly in the office and retail sectors.
There were no significant changes in yields during September. Office
total returns remained at 8.4% while the retail and industrial sectors
showed reductions in total returns to 9.4% and 10.2% respectively due to
the downward movement in capital growth.
As a result, the ''all property'' total returns showed a reduction
from 9.5% to 8.9%.

FARMERS in Aberdeenshire discover tomorrow whether they will get EU
compensation for the harvest disaster which struck them in early
September.
Lord Lindsay, the Scottish Office Agriculture Minister, speaking
yesterday at the ninth annual Scotgrow Horticultural Exhibition at
Ingliston near Edinburgh, gave no indication of any forthcoming
largesse.
However, he is to visit the North-east tomorrow, specifically the farm
of Bertie Maitland at Balhalgadry, Inverurie, when he is expected to
announce any possible rescue plan.
Lord Lindsay said: ''The department and SAC are still considering the
information of the #30m initial assessment of losses.''
Questioned over EU aid for both Holland and Spain because of climatic
conditions, he said: ''The secretary of state, Michael Forsyth, is aware
of those situations and is pressing the Scottish point. We are extremely
sympathetic but would emphasise that arable aid cheques are
guaranteed.''
Adding that this money covers almost all variable costs, the Minister
said that despite the extreme problems suffered by some indivdual
farmers, it was not a total financial disaster.
Meanwhile, John Ross, president of the National Farmers' Union of
Scotland, revealed that its chief executive, Tom Brady, will be in
Brussels today pushing for EU aid for the North-east.
Mr Ross said: ''I'm pleased that the minister is going back to the
North-east. I shall also be there. We have no indication yet of what he
may or may not announce. However, rest assured the union has argued the
case for help in Brussels, and is still fighting hard.''

THE Scottish Agricultural College and the University of Strathclyde
are seeking a commercial developer for a new plant propagation material
which, they claim, could transform horticultural capability in areas
faced with high salinity.
The new material, Pearlgel, went on show at the Scotgrow exhibition at
Ingliston, Edinburgh, yesterday. A new class of plant growing medium
designed for modern hydroponic systems, it will work in sand and highly
saline environments and is said to be environmentally benign as it
disperses as a powder after use.
Joint inventor Robin Szmidt of SAC said the new material offered an
opportunity for a manufacturer with vision to exploit ''this leading
edge scientific work''.
He said: ''This is a hi-tech material which could transform
horticultural capability in certain areas. It is an interesting spin-off
for Europe from work which we have been doing on materials for use in
desert areas with saline water supplies.''
The material, jointly developed with Professor Neil Graham at the
department of pure and applied chemistry at Strathclyde University, is
at present being patented. It is said to enhance plant root growth and
give improved water retention, aeration and drainage.
An SAC spokesman said: ''Current hydrogel growth media require complex
and expensive production facilities. This particular hydrogel complex is
simple and inexpensive to manufacture and could be produced anywhere in
the world.
''The development team is keen to discuss licensing of this technology
with organisations capable of taking it to commercial exploitation.''

BID terms worth 450p a share have now been announced for Internet
service provider Unipalm from UUNET, a comparable US company which has
yet to declare a profit. Unipalm had acted to take the froth off
speculative buying of its shares after it had announced a bid approach.
The shares hit 578p before tumbling to 410p but the #97m offer price
still compares with Unipalm's last annual profits of just #442,000,
which shows the market's faith in the Internet's rapid development. The
offer has already been accepted by holders of 49% of the equity.

SCAPA Group has agreed to purchase a US industrial weaving business
for $15m (#9.5m) to complement the product range of its United Wires
factory in Edinburgh.
United Wires and the newly-acquired woven products division of
National Filtration Corporation in Star City, Arkansas, both make fine
wire mesh filters used in the pulp and paper industry.
But Scapa finance director Derek Walter said the product ranges of the
two plants were complementary and the group hoped to sell United Wires
products in North America and products from the Arkansas factory in the
UK.

THE Treasury's failure to take action against cheap drink imports from
Continental Europe will cost Britain about #1750m in lost revenue this
year.
Meanwhile, legitimate foreign alcohol purchases now account for 11.3%
of the UK market for wines and spirits.
The Wine and Spirit Association estimates that the average car
crossing from the Continent carries enough drink to cost the Exchequer
#101 in duty it would have gained if those goods had been purchased in
Britain. For all sea traffic from the rest of Europe, the average is
about #75 on a total of 6.04 million vehicles. The estimates do not
include van trade, some of which has been linked to smuggling and
bootlegging.
The car losses are put directly at #453m for this year compared with
#312m last year and #274m in 1993.
The average car brings in 48 bottles of wine and 5.9 bottles of
spirits. The amount of beer brought in per car is about 67 litres. This
is equivalent to 11.3% of the total UK markets for both wines and
spirits.
Spirit imports rose by 175% this year, eqivalent to about #1300m in
turnover for the domestic trade, and so are affecting national
prosperity and jobs.
WSA chairman David Grant said that the message had been received by
the Government but he did not know what it would do. The matter had been
allowed to get out of hand and it was a way of life for some people.
He called for a fivefold increase in the number of excise officers.
They currently catch just 5% of smuggled goods -- and that is a Customs
and Excise estimate.
The WSA is calling for the cancellation of the surcharge placed on
alcohol last December as a first step in reducing the imbalance which
has resulted in UK duty being up to six times higher than that in some
Continental European countries.
It is also calling for a phased programme to bring UK duties into
line.

<TEXT>
Frankfurt, Wednesday -- The Bundesbank allowed its main money market
rate to slip today but analysts said the reduction was not significant
enough to signal Germany had adjusted policy to aid neighbour France's
beleaguered currency.
The Bundesbank let the so-called ''repo rate'' fall to 4.03% from
4.05% last week.
But the central bank only injected DM700m of extra liquidity into the
German banking system.
The addition of funds was below market expectations and will probably
ensure that German money market rates remain mostly steady in coming
days, dealers said.
''The repo award offers no signal at all,'' said Elisabeth Legge, an
economist at Dresdner Bank in London, referring to market speculation
the Bundesbank would step up its easing pace to help shore up the French
franc.
''The Bundesbank does not want to be seen making monetary policy for
political reasons,'' she said.
The repo rate, the rate at which the German central bank supplies
funds to banks against a deposit of securities, has been steadily
declining since mid-August after remaining at 4.5% for most of the
summer.
The Bundesbank's discount rate, the floor on German interest rates, is
currently set at 3.5% and its emergency Lombard borrowing rate is 5.5%.
Analysts said the Bundesbank was unable to push the rate much lower
because the bidding behaviour of the bank was very cautious and did not
offer the central bank sufficient room to allow the rate to fall
further. -- Reuter

WORK begins today on a #1.5m factory for Livingston-based Almond
Engineering which will double the size of its operation and lead to 10
new jobs, taking its workforce to 52.
The company, which started in the New Town 16 years ago, hopes to move
into its new premises next March.
Almond Engineering specialises in making moulds for the plastics
industry and for polystyrene packing and last year had a turnover of
almost #3m.
It also produces throw-away hinged sandwich packs and last year
produced more than 60 million of them.
Now the company has developed and patented a new snap-open resealable

LOW &amp; BONAR, the Dundee-based packaging group, has received approval
to buy out all the minority shareholders of its Canadian subsidiary
Bonar Inc for $C39m (#18.6m).
The move was approved by 92% of the shareholders who currently own 21%
of the Bonar Inc at a meeting on Tuesday.
Low &amp; Bonar first announced plans to buy out minority shareholders in
its Canadian subsidiary at $C38 per share in July.
Chief executive Jim Heilig welcomed shareholder approval of the move.
''This transaction will be earnings enhancing for Low &amp; Bonar and will
give us more flexibility in managing our North American business,'' he
said.
Ontario-based Bonar Inc controls Low &amp; Bonar's packaging and moulded
plastics business in Canada and the US. It made a pre-tax profit of
$C21.2m (#10.1m) last year on turnover of $C112m (#53.3m).
Low &amp; Bonar hopes that gaining full control of the subsidiary will
allow it to make acquisitions in North America more easily. The move
will also allow the group to finance its US and Canadian operations from
the UK.
Low &amp; Bonar shares gained 1p to 515p.

EVERY week in recent months has seemed to bring a new utility story.
Last week's was ScottishPower winning control of Manweb. This week's is
the likely takeover of Norweb by North West Water. If successful this
would be the first multi-utility takeover.
While North West Water has been at pains to stress that such a
takeover would be in the best interests of customers as well as
shareholders, there must be lingering doubt that this will indeed be the
case a few years down the line.
US-based Texas Energy Partners, jointly owned by Houston Industries
and Central &amp; South West Corporation, has the option of coming back with
yet another bid to pip North West Water to the post. Its last offer was
not final but there is some doubt about whether it will want to be seen
to overpay for the REC, especially since other bid targets still exist.
Other RECs yet to receive a bid include London Electricity, East
Midlands Electricity and Yorkshire Electricity. All their share prices
rose yesterday in anticipation of possible takeover action.

GOOD for Scotland, good for Britain must be the reaction to the
impending Lloyds-TSB merger. The logic of the deal is compelling with a
near perfect geographic fit between the two banks, both of which have
strong balance sheets.
The TSB has nowhere new to go. It has to fight with the other banking
alley cats to defend its place in the insurance business, once its major
advantage but in the last two years not the place to be after the
pensions mis-selling scandals.
The chance of teaming up with the Siamese of banks -- the breed can be
the most aggressive of cattus cattus -- was an unmissable opportunity.
Lloyds chief executive Sir Brian Pitman made it crystal clear that
having started the ball rolling with the #1800m purchase of Cheltenham &amp;
Gloucester, and now the TSB, his ambitions were far from sated.
The term merger is a face-saver and TSB chairman Sir Nicholas Goodison
is looking happier than for many a day as responsibilities slip from his
shoulders.
TSB chief executive Peter Ellwood, who becomes a deputy chief
executive in the new operation, should resolve the nagging Pitman
succession problem.
The estimate of #350m worth of annual savings by 1999 is obviously
very conservative and cash generation from high fee earning, low risk
banking will release substantial capital to make further acquisitions.
One inhibition may be the timing of legal approval of the TSB
acquisition which could take two years. But with an asset base of #15bn
there must be one or two other banks and building societies feeling
rather exposed.
Lloyds' concern may be that its move has pushed up the premiums for
the less efficient building societies -- at least in the short term.
The consumer should benefit through better product pricing until the
need to maintain market share leads inexorably to credit control
problems and panic diversification. That will come very late in the day
for Lloyds TSB.
It is difficult to see any other partner for TSB who could benefit the
customer better or the shareholder, who takes priority at Lloyds above
anyone else.

<TEXT>
FISONS has somewhat reluctantly accepted the revised and final terms
from Rhone-Poulenc Rorer as the hoped for white knight failed to come up
with any alternative.
Speculation over who it was is now pointless and Fisons' fate was
really sealed by the way its shares stayed below the offer value
enabling RPR to pick them up in the market with impunity. Its holding
must now be approaching 30%, making it virtually impossible for a
another bidder to mount a credible counter-attack. It could not risk
being left with a possibly obstructive minority shareholder.
So Fisons is to be denied the opportunity to prove its new strategy
would deliver profits growth and rescue a reputation severely dented by
past mishaps.
It had sold off its interests in pharmaceutical research, scientific
instruments, laboratory supplies and horticultural products, which
generated a cash pile of #350m, to concentrate on its asthma treatment
technology and on licensing products to sell through its sales force.
Hindsight will probably show that RPR got hold of Fisons at quite a
reasonable price given the latter's international position in the
anti-asthma arena. It is a long-term growth market unless something
dramatic is done about air pollution, which is highly unlikely.
Combining the businesses will give RPR a major position in an expanding
market.
While it has got what it wants, RPR's takeover tactics appear to have
been excessively aggressive and a gentler approach might have secured an
agreed bid at reduced cost, if fees and other charges are taken into
account.
Integration is invariably easier following an agreed deal as managers
are not alienated, though it does not necessarily mean that job losses
are fewer as a result.
The deal indicates that there is not much future for medium-sized
pharmaceutical companies. Research is so costly and returns so
problematic that it can only be afforded by the giants, though there
will always be room for venture capital companies emerging from
university research departments to try their luck with a new idea.
As for the marketing end of the business, this is highly competitive
and likely to be low margin as the products available for licensing will
have been through their initial sales flush.

PHARMACEUTICALS
FISONS has throw in the towel in its battle against Franco-American
bidder Rhone-Poulenc Rorer (RPR) and is recommending shareholders accept
the revised 265p a share offer.
The pharmaceuticals group had been talking to a possible white knight
but the discussions came to nothing so it has decided to accept RPR. It
had earlier rejected the revised final offer -- raised from the original
240p -- but now considers it a fair price. The bid closes on October 20.
In the absence of a counter-bidder, continued resistance was
impossible because shareholders were voting with their feet in favour of
the price on offer by selling shares in the market. RPR has bought more
than 20% of the equity and Fisons' shares are standing at under the
offer level at 262[1/2]p, down [1/2]p.
The market has been speculating over the identity of the possible
white knight, with US firms such as Schering-Plough, Forest Laboratories
and Roberts Pharmaceuticals mentioned as possible candidates. Others
included Hoffman La Roche in Switzerland and Boehringer Ingelheim of
Germany. For once, analysts had no idea of who it might be and Fisons
provided no hints.
Chief executive Stuart Wallis said: ''We had reason to believe the
discussions could lead to proposals being put . . . that would be more
valuable than the final offer from RPR.''
The French-owned US group has a management team already selected to
parachute into Fisons as soon as it gets control. RPR aims to integrate
the company as quickly as possible and some disposals and closures are
likely, with some loss of jobs.
RPR president Robert Cawthorn commented: ''The combination of RPR's
respiratory business with Fisons will create a powerful force in the
vitally important field of asthma/allergy.''
Despite earlier antagonism, relations between the two companies are
amicable, according to Mr Wallis, who indicated he might stay on if RPR
made him a suitable offer.
Fisons' main attractions are its expertise in asthma drugs and
delivery systems and its strong sales force. Given rising air pollution
levels, asthma treatment is a growth market worldwide and with Fisons,
RPR will be a major player in it.

BUILDING boss Lord Goold turned Superman yesterday when he smashed his
way through a ''brick wall'' to open the new premises of a print company
which turns out more than 10 billion labels for the food and drinks
industry every year, writes LACHIE KENNEDY.
But the chairman of the McTaggart &amp; Mickel building group almost came
to grief as he punched his way through the cardboard barrier to mark the
opening of a new era for printing company Gavin Watson in Glasgow's
Possilpark.
As he stepped through he almost lost his footing but recovered quickly
to join the rest of the guests.
The company, which prints labels for household names such as Irn-Bru,
Safeway, Sainsbury, Marks &amp; Spencer, Strathmore Mineral Water and
Harrods, has moved just round the corner from Killearn Street to the
site of the former Askit factory in Sarcen Street.
Chairman Mary Samuel said: ''With the huge advance in technology
within our industry it was imperative for us to have this extra space so
we could invest in the most up to date machinery.
''It is only with this advanced plant that we can satisfy the needs of
our highly valued customers.''
Lord Goold praised the company, which employs 50 staff who were also
present at the opening.
He said: ''This is the last major manufacturing company in Possilpark,
which used to have a high density of manufacturing. It is a great credit
to the company that they are investing in the area.''
Gavin Watson has an annual turnover of #3m.

STANDARD Life is poised to re-enter the Indian life assurance market
when it is liberalised next year.
The Edinburgh-based company said it had signed a joint-venture
agreement with India's Housing Development and Finance Corporation
(HDFC) to set up a life assurance business as soon as the necessary
legislation was in place.
Standard Life is the second Scottish insurance company to announce
plans to return to India in the light of government plans to reopen the
sector to private enterprise and foreign capital.
Last month, Perth-based General Accident signed a memorandum of
understanding with India's Wadia Group on setting up a joint venture in
non-life insurance.
Standard Life sealed its joint venture with HDFC, which is India's
largest housing finance company, by acquiring a 5% stake in its new
partner for an undisclosed sum.
HDFC is quoted on the Bombay stock exchange and has a network of
branches and part-time brokers covering 2500 Indian cities. It has
300,000 borrowers and 265,000 depositors.
India nationalised life assurance in 1956 and general insurance in
1972, but the present government is liberalising the economy across the
board and foreign investors are flooding back.
A government committee recommended last year that the insurance sector
be liberalised. It also said that foreign companies should be allowed to
participate through joint ventures with a local partner.
Standard Life, which is Europe's largest mutual assurance company,
said it expected the Indian insurance market to open up some time in
1996.
The company previously operated in India from 1847 to 1938, while
General Accident was active there until 1972.
Standard Life's return forms part of a strategy of diversifing away
from its mainstream life assurance and pensions business in the UK.
The process began last year when Standard Life entered the UK health
insurance market through its purchase of Prime Health.
This was followed by its acquisition of Prosperity, a life insurance
company in Spain.
Last month Standard Life opened a branch in Germany, where it hopes to
build up life assurance sales through local brokers.
Assistant general manager John Thomson said Standard Life's future
overseas expansion would focus on European Union countries.
''We are spending a lot of time looking at opportunities in Europe,''
he said. ''Europe is our priority. We have got to be ready for the
single market in financial products when it comes.''
Mr Thomson said Standard Life chose India in preference to other
emerging markets because it had been able to secure a foothold there at
the very start of liberalisation in the insurance sector.

ECONOMY
THE apparent peace pact between Chancellor Kenneth Clarke and Governor
of the Bank of England Eddie George over interest rates remains fragile
on the evidence of their September 7 monetary meeting. While not openly
calling for an immediate increase in rates, the Governor, as in the
previous meeting between the two, stressed the risks of delaying action.
Pulling all the evidence together, Mr George thought the softer real
economy might hold the feed-through of cost pressures in the short term.
If the real economy was to continue to grow more slowly, that could
have implications for the rate of inflation further ahead; but the
Bank's present view remained that the odds were against achieving the
inflation target over the next two years or so without some further
tightening of policy.
The Governor said this was reflected also in the inflationary
expectations implied in the gilt-edged market. He conceded, though, that
the softness of the economy and increased uncertainty about future
demand that had become apparent over the summer made the case for an
immediate move in interest rates less pressing.
For his part, the Chancellor argued that little had changed in the
data over the previous month to alter his view that interest rates
should not be changed.
He said the recent increases in interest rates had occurred because of
fears that cost pressures would feed through the price chain, and
because the economy was growing at an unsustainable rate. On both these
counts the outlook for inflation had improved, he said.
Since this meeting the Chancellor and Governor have met again on
September 29 -- and left rates well alone. Whether the Governor is still
talking about the danger of delay will be seen when the minutes of that
meeting are released on Wednesday, November 15.
But an increasing number of analysts and business bodies, including
the CBI, now believe the next move could well be down given the
sluggishness of the economy.
The hope is that it is just a pause, but if the data running up to the
Budget and beyond should indicate something more serious, the Chancellor
may be tempted to loosen the reins a little. At present, though, the
authorities believe that growth is set to continue at a more sustainable
level.
The Governor, speaking on Tuesday at the G7 meeting in Washington in
place of the Chancellor, said that while there were uncertainties in the
short term, the Government shared the view of the IMF that the prospect
for the UK over the next two years was for sustained growth with low
inflation.
He said inflation had fallen to its lowest rate in a generation; and
although the increase in import prices over the past year might lead to
some rise in the short term, the outlook further ahead remained
encouraging.
However, he warned: ''To achieve our inflation target of 2.5% or less
we must nevertheless, of course, persist in sound monetary and fiscal
policies.''
Meanwhile, a panel of economists from securities house Goldman Sachs
and the Institute of Fiscal Studies is forecasting that base rates will
indeed fall in the coming six months as the economy continues to slow,
but a pick-up in growth and inflation pressures will send them back up
in the second half of 1996.
An outcome such as this was recently described by the CBI's new
director-general Adair Turner as extremely damaging because of the
severe impact it would have on consumer confidence. Any cut in rates had
to be sustainable.
But Goldman Sachs economist David Walton said rates would stand at
around 6.5% by March compared with 6.75% at present.

<HEADLINE>Launch costs of minivans hit earnings at Chrysler</HEADLINE>

<PAGE>21</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>975929639</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
Detroit, Wednesday -- Costs and lost production from the launch of its
new generation of minivans combined with a steep sales plunge in Mexico
to help depress Chrysler Corporation's third-quarter profits by 46%.
The results released by the No 3 domestic automaker today were not
unexpected, since the third quarter historically is the weakest period
of the year for the Big Three.
But Chrysler's poor showing in Mexico provided a graphic illustration
of the severe impact on American companies operating in that country,
which has been struggling through a severe recession since late 1994.
Chrysler sold only 6000 vehicles in Mexico for the July-September
quarter. That's fewer than it sells in the United States during a
typical day. A year earlier, Chrysler sold 24,000 vehicles in Mexico.
The automaker reported net earnings for the July-September period were
$354m, or 91 cents a share, compared with $651m, or $1.76 a share, in
last year's third quarter.
Rebates and other buyer incentives cost Chrysler about $870 a vehicle
in the third quarter against $1035 in the second.
Its profit-per-vehicle was $492, down about $109 from a year ago but
$189 higher than in the second quarter.
Executive vice-president Gary Valade, the company's chief financial
officer, expressed optimism about profit growth for the next year.
''There are an awful lot of good signs for the fourth quarter and 1996,
the first one being the minivan launch essentially will be behind us,''
he said after the earnings report.
''We'll also have some much needed pick-up truck capacity come on
stream in December, January and February.''
Key to the prediction is the performance of the economy, Valade said.
''Every indicator we read seems to project that we will be having a soft
landing, and therefore we'll have two or three good years of auto sales,
at least at the rate they're at now, perhaps a tad or so moved up.''
General Motors Corporation reports earnings on Tuesday and Ford's
report is expected a day later. Those figures also are expected to show
year-over-year drops in profit.
Combined, the Big Three's third-quarter profits are likely to total
about $1200m, down from about $2300m a year ago.
* Frankfurt -- Law authorities won't know until early next year
whether to charge a Volkswagen executive with stealing General Motors
documents when he left the US carmaker in 1993, an official said today.
German authorities had previously said they expected to decide by this
autumn whether to prosecute purchasing chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de
Arriortua, once a cost-cutting whiz at GM. But Hans-Hermann Eckert, a
spokesman for the federal prosecutor's office, said investigators need
more time to sift through a mountain of evidence.
They also want to interview witnesses in Spain to determine whether
Lopez handed over GM plans for a new factory that VW could use to build
a proposed plant in the Basque region, he said.

sort of money to play with), but also the huge, unaccounted-for social
and environmental costs. The only people who would bear those costs are
the citizens of Rutherglen and Glasgow. Toryglen, for example, would
have to sacrifice open spaces and play areas to make way for the
relocated rail depot.
Most people now accept that building major roads generates extra
traffic, especially in urban situations where there is already
congestion. The suppressed demand for road space in Glasgow is such that
the completion of the so-called ''missing link'' of the M74 would
unleash a tidal wave of commuter traffic as motorists realise they might
save 10 minutes at peak hours on getting to work.
Mr Henderson claims the electronics industry has considered
alternatives but decided against them because it will be some years
before they can meet the industry's needs. But it will take at least six
years to build the M74 with all the disruption that construction will
cause not only to local communities but also to road traffic all over
the South Side of Glasgow.
Within months improved freight railheads to the west of Glasgow could
be developed for Inverclyde and central Ayrshire at a tiny fraction of
the cost of the M74, enabling exporters to ''get round Glasgow'' with
speed and reliability and no congestion.
Businesses could also use existing Government and European grants to
set up in Glasgow next to the West Coast main line -- an international
rail link.
Commercial sense alone, not to mention social, environmental, and
common sense, should make this monstrous proposal out of the question.

SO the powers who can influence local investment have banded together
to support the proposal for the M74 extension in Glasgow -- with an
appropriate slogan, Complete to Compete. The support might be more
accurately stated as Destroy and Disband in order to Expand.
This move suggests that the strength of the argument for the proposal
is poorer than was originally thought and/or the level of concern (or
opposition) expressed, by those likely to be most affected by its
construction, has been greater than anticipated.

AS one who has cycled regularly since leaving school in 1947, it is
good to see that Strathclyde region's policy is to get more cyclists on
the roads (October 6).
It was also very good news to hear the Millennium Fund is disbursing
#42m to the cycling body Sustrans to build a long-distance cycle route
from Dover to Inverness.
However, it is ironic, at a time when there is so much encouragement
being given to the cycling fraternity, that the provision for taking
one's bicycle on the railways (apart from the Strathclyde network) has
never been more meagre. I refere particularly to the West Highland and
Highland lines.
A separate luggage-van would make all the difference.

YOUR editorial on the STUC's stance on the proposed size of a Scottish
parliament finds it hard to share Campbell Christie's concern over
representation of what you label ''diverse groups'' (October 6).
The suggestion seems to be that if tenants' associations, churches,
and others wish to take part in political discussions they should join a
political party. By implication, the only legitimate vehicle for
political action in this country is, and should continue to be, the
political party system.
This view is at odds not only with the Scottish Constitutional
Convention, which is firmly committed to ensuring that the parliament
and its operations are electorate-friendly, but also with the many
community and voluntary sector organisations throughout Scotland which
are already exerting their influence on decision-making without
affiliating to the political parties.
To suggest that Scottish society's richness and diversity can be
adequately reflected within the party political system reveals a
seriously inadequate analysis of the dynamics of Scottish civic society.
Energy, imagination, and commitment are the hallmarks of many of the
organisations lumped together in the ''and such like'' category of your
editorial. These qualities flourish precisely because activists have
developed ways of organising, expressing themselves, and getting things
done which work best for them and their participation in the civic
assembly simply reinforces the value of having a non-party-political
forum in which to debate issues.
Scotland has the chance to emerge from the twentieth century as an
example of a modern inclusive democracy. It is a chance which will slip
away if politicans and the media try to squeeze the lively variety of
Scottish civic society into the ill-fitting corset of party politics.
Many of Scotland's politicans at all levels already know this and have
recently confirmed to Sead their commitment to change. It is a pity that
The Herald appears to be out of step when it should be out in front on
an issue of crucial importance to the future of Scotland.

PAUL H Scott indulges in outdated 1980s-style nationalist hyperbole
when he says, ''For 16 years we have had policies we detest imposed on
us by a party which we have soundly rejected at the polls'' (October 6).
For the past 16 years ''we'' have rejected all parties at the polls;
it is only a question of degree.
An average 58% of voters in Scotland have rejected Labour, some 67%
have rejected the Conservatives, and a whopping 84% have rejected the
SNP.
It is specious nonsense to talk in those terms of course; people do
not vote in coalitions against parties, they vote as individuals for the
parties of their choice.
For the past 16 years (and longer) the Conservative Party has been
Scotland's second favourite choice, averaging only 9% behind the Labour
Party. Hardly an indication of universal detestation of Conservative
policies.
On the other hand, if Mr Scott wishes to play the game by his own
rules we would have to accept that for the past 16 years the SNP's
separatist policies have been the most detested in Scotland.

TOM Shields's reference to the Top Guns of Strathaven Academy gives
graphic point to an unnecessary educational dilemma facing many Scottish
schools (October 6).
Equality of opportunity is a fine piece of educational dogma but when
accompanied by planned equality in academic progress the rapid
development of the brighter pupils is invariably inhibited. Such a
policy cannot serve the long-term interests of Scotland.
Too often any mention of high fliers, or an academic elite, draws a
sneering response. Elitism has had a bad press, and many young people
have suffered educationally as a result.
Their burgeoning talents, which have placed them in advance of their
peers, have been suppressed by inexcusable educational neglect and
inadequate teaching. This should be a matter for shame rather than
egalitarian rejoicing.
Mixed-ability classes -- especially in a pupil's later years -- have
restricted the legitimate progress of too many good students. They have
led to boredom, frustration, and diminished prospects.
This iniquitous system, based originally on naked social engineering,
should be abandoned in favour of the sound, educationally proven
streaming of students according to their ability.
Young people and parents alike know this; only the educational
hierarchy remains obdurate.
Scotland, we are told, is an ancient but re-emergent kingdom. If so,
and if we entertain any thoughts of becoming a self-sufficient and
skilfully led nation, we would do well to nurture our best progeny,
wherever they occur, and in whatever field they may arise.

POLITICIANS appear to believe that the cures to all our educational
ills are more money and smaller classes. Now a very old retired teacher,
I began my career in primary teaching with classes always of 40 or more.
They didn't study French or have computers but they left the primary
able to write competent English and add, subtract, multiply, and divide
-- in most cases better than third-year pupils whom I encountered in my
later teaching years.
The great educational truth ignored by our political experts is that
nursery, primary, and secondary education is only a very fragile part of
the child's growth in learning which begins on the day of his birth and
is a 24-hour process.
The home, as teachers all know, makes or breaks a child. The child
learns from his parents' example even more than their words.
For some years I interviewed parents of secondary pupils -- children
who had fallen behind because of truancy or indiscipline. I still have
those notes and of 80 or so interviews a year 75% of troubles seemed to
spring from both parents working and being out of touch and too tired to
cope with their children.
It is easy to blame television or other modern distractions but
children must have a secure homelife to reap any benefit from schooling
even of the most expensive kind.

NUMERACY is evidently not one of the Scottish Education Minister's
core skills. In his attack on council ''dogma'' for rejecting the
Government's nursery vouchers pilot scheme, he claims that ''every
parent will have lost the opportunity to get a voucher for #1100'' next
year (October 7).
The pilot budget of #3m (from money already deducted from local
authority grants) would at most pay for some 2700 places, or an average
of 88 in each new local authority.
Whom does he think he's kidding? Certainly not parents. His message is
clear, no vouchers, no nursery schools. Now that's dogmatic.

BILL Cruikshank will surely find he is wrong in his assertion that
there is little if any teaching about the heroic times of Mel Gibson
(October 4) if he extends his vision to include primary schools.
The records show that 900 copies of the Topic Study on the Scottish
Wars of Independence were produced and sold in its present form, while
unrecorded numbers were given freely to teachers on request in a more
supportive era.
To these numbers must be added the hundreds of teachers who took
advantage of the excellent in-service courses run by the authors Fred
Rendell and Arnold Bell from the late 70s until their retirements.
Unfortunately a copy of the book cannot be found to send to Mr
Cruikshank because the publication is now out of print and will not be
reprinted.
Copies, however, do exist in some libraries, resource centres and, of
course, in primary schools.

MR P H Scott, a vice president of the SNP, writes that the SNP ''have
always regarded as Scottish anyone who lives in Scotland'' and Dr Allan
Macartney, the deputy leader, claims that within the EU ''all citizens
of Scotland will be simultaneously both Scots and Europeans''.
This definition of a Scot as merely being anyone who lives in Scotland
raises some interesting questions. Does it mean that an Englishman
living in the English town of Berwick is not a Scot but immediately
becomes one the minute he moves up to Berwickshire? Does he cease to be
a Scot the minute he moves back?
Does a Scotsman living in Berwickshire cease to be a Scot the minute
he moves down to Berwick? If he doesn't cease to be a Scot yet the
Englishman does, then why so?

I WAS interested to read about the Galloway radio station exchanging
Scottish radio programmes around the world on the Internet (October 9).
We at fma Ltd have, for some time now, been using the Internet to
exchange text, pictures, and sound (in real time) with colleagues in
America. Though based in Edinburgh, we do now see ourselves as part of a
world community, albeit digital and virtual.
From an individual at a PC ''talking'' with a distant friend, it seems
only a natural step for whole communities to be globally ''talking'' to
each other, and this radio idea seems a good start.
We consider that this global communications technology is continually
reinforcing Scotland as part of the world, and not just a part of

GLASGOW is to have an opera school. Not many citizens know this but
the 26 families, many of them pensioners, residents in the beautiful
listed McConnel Building, know about it, to their cost.
Having endured much during the building of the massive Royal Academy
of Music and Drama they thought the work at an end with the completion
of the car-park, grateful that they still had a small amount of open
aspect across the city.
Now plans are afoot to build a four-storey opera school in the
car-park, effectively shutting the residents in and shutting the world
out.
The much admired verandas which are a feature of the building will
again be hidden as they were before redevelopment of the area exposed
them to view for the first time.
The proposed building will be the Alexander Gibson Opera School -- or
the National Opera School of Scotland, no-one is quite sure.
We are tolerant people but, as the present custodians, we are not
prepared to allow the total integrity of our prestigious building to be
compromised by the erection of something which, at best, can only be
described as mediocre.
We believe that the late Sir Alexander Gibson deserves something
better; that Glasgow, City of Architecture and Design 1999, deserves
something better; and that Scotland deserves something better.

THERE is a stamp all over Mr Michael Forsyth's speech yesterday on the
subject of what is fancifully called ''A Blueprint for British
Devolution''. Can it be the stamp of the Secretary of State for
Scotland? Mr Forsyth promised to be a listening Secretary of State. He
has been listening; how, therefore, can he be the author of such a
heated piece of rhetoric, much of which is so out of tune in many
respects with Scottish opinion that its author must surely suffer from
severe tinnitus. The clue lies in a quotation from Rudyard Kipling which
is pressed into service as an attack on Messrs Blair, Prescott, and
Brown. We refuse to believe that Mr Forsyth is ''irresistibly reminded
of Rudyard Kipling's lines'', or indeed of anything to do with Kipling.
Now Mr Gerald Warner, the highly paid (from the public purse) political
adviser to Mr Forsyth is just your man when it comes to Kipling and
other obsolete ephemera. There are many traces of the radical Mr Warner
in the speech, not all of which is wrong-headed.
To be specific, Mr Forsyth's jaundiced views of the manner in which
the emerging and mostly Labour-controlled unitary authorities have
appointed their expensive staff have some force. Mistakes have been made
and continue to be made and the Labour Party, by seemingly failing to
exert control, or even to apply sensible advice to its representatives,
has laid down a good number of future targets for the Tories. This does
not absolve the Tories from blame entirely. Nobody asked for the new
authorities, many of them have a virtually impossible job and undeniably
require much professional help, and we must remember that the whole
system was created and sanctioned by Mr Ian Lang.
It is in the rhetoric on ''devolution'', of engineering a massive
abdication of power by Government, of devolving power into
neighbourhoods, streets, and private houses that we come to evidence of
utter insensitivity. Mr Forsyth says that the ultimate unit of
devolution is the individual. This is dangerous stuff. If taken
seriously it is a denial of a cohesive society and is uncomfortably
close to nihilism.
The speech also contains a glaring factual inaccuracy. Mr Forsyth
claims that next year's electricity bills are expected to be #90 lower
than this year's. The Electricity Regulator, in contrast, expects the
electricity bills to drop by #91 over the next three years. It may be
that this is the sort of speech expected at party conferences, but if Mr
Forsyth subscribes to every line it cannot be said honestly that he has
changed since his radical Thatcherite days. Perhaps he should turn to
Kipling, who wrote: ''Teach us to delight in simple things/ And mirth
that has no bitter springs.''

THE footballer Duncan Ferguson is not surprised that his three-month
sentence for assault on the football pitch has been confirmed. Nor
should he be, although the unfortunate part of the whole affair is the
fact that abundant warnings of growing official interest in such
behaviour were ignored by both players and football legislators. There
is a surprisingly long history of these warnings, reaching back to Mr
John McCluskey QC when, as Solicitor-General for Scotland in 1974, he
warned that, while it was not the practice of the criminal authorities
to bring charges in such circumstances, it was impossible to ignore the
fact that attacks with fists or feet constitute an assault. By 1983 a
rugby player had been fined in a Sheriff Court for stamping on an
opponent's face and in 1987 football was involved when Chris Woods and
Terry Butcher of Rangers were convicted of disorderly conduct and breach
of the peace and lost their appeals against conviction.  This is all
very well. It is impossible to say that sport was unaware of the growing
storm clouds. There is, though, a case for the defence which is often
neglected in favour of ridiculous allegations of ''witchhunts''. Lord
Murray articulated it when, in taking a minority opinion in favour of
Woods and Butcher, he wondered whether activities on the sporting field
constituted breaches of criminal law in the context of a contact sport
which was not in mind when law was formed.
This is a reasonable question, although it did not save Woods and
Butcher and matters have hardened now. In the case of Mr Ferguson it is
probable that the authorities were influenced by his previous
convictions for assault. The unpredictable behaviour of
procurators-fiscal in bringing, or not bringing, charges is another
issue, although it is clear that if undeniable television evidence is
available, as in Mr Ferguson's case, the fiscal's duty is clearer. With
Mr Ferguson's conviction a new stage has been reached and a precedent
established. If sport and sportsmen believed (wrongly) that the previous
warning signs were not clear enough, they know better now and must act
accordingly.

SOCIAL work, we sometimes feel, must be like sitting on a bed of nails
while being hit over the head with a blunt object. To say this is not
blindly to support social workers, but the old saw which describes them
as ''damned if they do, and damned if they don't'' is accurate more
often than not. If, as seems likely, it would be useful to define the
role of social workers in more specific terms this should be done. Lord
Clyde believes that social workers should not investigate cases of child
abuse. This view is strengthened by the sensible views of Strathclyde's
Director of Social Work who points out that responding in a caring way
to disclosures made by a possibly abused child is often incompatible
with the stringent rules of evidence. In proceeding to court hearings
social workers, whose notes may have been taken in a caring and
supportive context, are frequently dissected by lawyers applying
different rules with the sanction of the court.
This is no longer either fair or helpful. Ms Hartnoll wishes to
emphasise that it is perfectly possible for social workers to
concentrate on their core task of supporting and helping families, while
still remaining alert to hints of possible abuse. This would allow them
to continue to work with families who might otherwise have been
antagonised by the present requirement for social workers to move
straight into investigation at any hint of abuse. Two things follow from
this analysis. First, the task of investigation must fall to the police.
Excellent work has already been done by some forces in training officers
in this role, but the second requirement is for a wider acknowledgement
of this aspect of police work and an expansion of relevant training.
Then, and only then, will social workers be able to fulfil their true
role.

RECENT articles on the question of open-cast developments fall very
short of competent argument or debate in their support. The lobby
against open-cast mining considers several points.
Compared with deep mines, open casts require over 100 times more land
per tonne of coal, putting it on top of the list as the most
environmentally destructive process and the greatest threat ever to the
Scottish countryside. In spite of claims to the contrary, there is no
economic justification for these extractions with costs per tonnage
(taking inflation into consideration) as high as that in the final
throws of the deep-mining industry. When did you last see your coal or
electricity bills go down?
Every adult deserves the right to work for a decent wage for their own
wellbeing and in support of their home and family. During 1984, the
miners fought and lost that right, purely to satisfy one woman. By
decimating Scottish industry, Margaret Thatcher went about her business
-- almost unnoticed -- nailing up the ''For Sale'' sign over our
communities, our heritage, our future; laying the path for the now
private-sector speculators and non-elected quangos. Meanwhile, concerned
voters swallow the labour pills and hope to lead a normal and healthy
life. Scrambling for a few jobs, parents working for as little as #1.35
an hour, usually in part-time work; full-time workers expected to do
longer hours, more people than ever claiming income support, the
decimation of family and community life is hardly normal or healthy.
It is obvious when reading Cumnock &amp; Doon Valley District Council's
local plans that apart from a few niknaks here and there, the majority
of effort and funding for townscape and environment, leisure,
recreation, and tourism for example, go to Cumnock and Mauchline. Yes,
these communities serve a larger population but this is partly due to
inward investment in these areas encouraging an influx of professional
and skilled people and has determined the locals to remain or return.
Outlying communities, however, are witnessing a decrease in population
with some places actually disappearing altogether.
In Auchinleck's local plan, the main street is described in black and
white by our elected representatives as ''lacking in architectural
character'' with a ''dull and monotonous appearance''. Is the planning
department not in any way responsible for this? These claims are hardly
going to attract tourism, business opportunities, or any other
investment interests. Except of course for the mining companies in whose
eyes these conditions are verging on perfect. Outlying areas within
Cumnock &amp; Doon Valley are not alone under these grim circumstances --
although this district does far worse with 60% of all open-cast
operations happening here.
The character of the central belt's countryside of flat plains of
wetland and moor, contained by low rolling hills, runs from north
Dumfriesshire to Ayrshire, Lanarkshire through the Lothians north to
Stirlingshire and Fife and is being totally devastated by open-cast
mining. Gutted moorlands across the coal belt are cradling gasping
communities that were once vibrant with a capable and willing
population.
Without ever forgetting the wildlife of the mosses, this issue is not
one of birds and trees versus people (ie open-cast workers) but that of
creating a viable future for the individual, his family, community, and
environment. The young people are the ones bearing the brunt of two
major failures; the first one that of the miners to defeat a determined
regime and the second, the failure of that regime to provide an
alternative.
The mining companies are laying claim to massive tracts of land and
coal reserves that could benefit the surrounding communities for
decades, even centuries, to come, but only if managed and mined without
greed and hate being the overriding factor. To see the poverty and crime
in the mining schemes and then witness the multimillion pound coal
carpet being pulled from beneath their feet is appalling and disgraceful
in this supposedly civilised society. It amazes me that Scottish coal
has not been treated with the same respect as other vital assets, ie
water, electricity, gas, oil, agriculture, nuclear energy, all of which
are regularly on the lips of politicians, on the news, and discussed at
great length, yet somehow coal has become a dirty word.
Do any of the major political parties have the nerve to pry the lid
off this particularly nasty can of worms? I'm sure you've all had a
peek. But on being rather unsure of the species -- its needs, fears,
pleasures, angers -- prefer to replace the lid tightly and get on with
something a bit less disturbing.
I must add that the local newspaper, the Cumnock Chronicle in this
instance, does not have the veto on Yes or No to open-cast mining, nor
should the planning department who have already shown their incompetence
by allowing a company to mine for 10 months without, I understand,
having proper planning consent. Law and order must prevail over these
anarchic circumstances. May I suggest the installing of security cameras
with perhaps a few more bobbies on this particular beat and maybe an
Ayrshire-wide ''Operation Curfew''.
* Mary Leitch is a 33-year-old housewife and mother now working as an
illustrator in Inverness. She was born and lived in the Auchinleck area
until a year ago, having campaigned continuously against open-cast
mining developments. She and her family left because, she claims, she
could see no future in the area.

Major S Ramsay Blackley, OBE, MBE (military), BSc; soldier and wool
expert; born August 13, 1920, died October 6, 1995
RAMSAY Blackley, who died on October 6 at the age of 75, had a
distinguished wartime career and went on to become the influential chief
executive of the British Wool Marketing Board for more than 20 years. He
also wrote about survival of death.
Born in Dumfries to a well-known farming family, Ramsay Blackley was
educated at Sedbergh School and Glasgow and Oxford Universities. On the
outbreak of the Second World War, he was an agriculture student on a
farm in Denmark but returned to Britain before the Germany occupation.
Commissioned into his local regiment, the King's Own Scottish
Borderers, he graduated into 26 Squadron RAF as air intelligence liaison
officer where he was affectionately known as ''Tartan Trousers.'' When
planning began for D-Day, he was posted to the headquarters of 21st Army
Group/2nd Tactical Air Force and made responsible for the transmission
of intelligence material to all services involved.
After the British Army reached the Rhine and the Arnhem Operation
failed to open the way into Germany, preparations for a Rhine crossing
were started and Ramsay Blackley was able from aerial photographs to
obtain vital intelligence about planned crossing points and enemy
positions. He was subsequently awarded the military MBE on the
recommendation of the RAF and mentioned in despatches by the Army Group
Commander.
When the German armed forces surrendered there was a breakdown of
civil order in the country. Many of the experienced managers were
ex-members of the Nazi party who were subject to arrest or dismissed
from positions of authority. Refugees were on the move.Looting and
stealing, especially of foodstuffs from farmers, were rife.
Before the British Zone Control Commission arrived, order had to be
maintained by military government. Thanks to his experience on the
General Staff and his knowledge of agriculture, the young Blackley was
asked to take over responsibility for civil maintenance in the Province
of Schleswig-Holstein. This included management of forest, game, and
fuel supplies as well as systems of food rationing.
After his release from the Army, Ramsay Blackley finished his
interrupted studies for his BSc. in agriculture at Glasgow University
and then went on to obtain a post-graduate diploma at Oxford University.
After working with the Farmer and Stock Breeder, he was invited to join
the staff of the British Wool Marketing Board, which took over in 1950
from Wool Control, a wartime government department, and was responsible
for marketing all the wool produced in the United Kingdom.
He became the board's chief executive, retaining that position until
his retirement more than 20 years later.
Ramsay Blackley realised that sensible rationalisation and
modernisation of the industry were badly needed and his pursuit of these
resulted in an OBE.
After a heart attack in 1964, Ramsay Blackley became fascinated by the
subject of surviving near-death experiences. In London's Brompton
Hospital he had a cardiac arrest and for several minutes was clinically
dead. His heart was re-started by a massive electric shock moments
before brain damage would be certain.
When he retired from the wool marketing board he decided to undertake
research to try to find out what would have happened to him if he had
stayed dead. Having studied the relevant religious and psychical beliefs
on the subject, he wrote a book, As in Adam All Die. His conclusion was
that there was no credible evidence of survival of death.
He leaves Deirdre, his wife for 42 years, and a son and daughter.

Sir Philip Oppenheimer, diamond financier and racehorse owner and
breeder; born October 29, 1911, died October 8, 1995
MANY first impressions of Sir Philip Oppenheimer were of a remote
figure. Only later did it become clear that instead, he was a rather
reserved person, almost to the point of shyness.
Yet he must be regarded as having been a most astute negotiator and
history may remember him as the main postwar architect of the stability
in the international diamond industry.
He was regarded as a somewhat shadowy figure in what was, and still
is, a mysterious organisation -- the De Beers Consolidated Mines
subsidiary, the Central Selling Organisation.
It was established by the diamond king Ernest Oppenheimer in 1934 in
London as the successor company to the much older Diamond Trading
Company. That body was established to control the market price of rough
or uncut diamonds in South Africa by stockpiling in times of weakness
and recovering the money in better times through reducing stocks. Prices
to producers were guaranteed and were never to be reduced.
Its success was such that for about two decades, the CSO handled
almost 90% of world primary diamond production. Sir Philip's negotiating
talents were taxed frequently. The year 1960 was one of the most arduous
periods but was crowned with two long-term successes.
The Sierra Leone alluvial diamond mines in West Africa were supplying
about 25% of the diamonds bought by the CSO. However, there was a huge
leakage of stones sold to unlicensed dealers, undermining prices in the
Antwerp cutting centre.
De Beers had recruited former MI5 chief and Glasgow gang-buster chief
constable Sir Percy Sillitoe to set up an International Diamond Security
Organisation to buy in the diamonds from an army of illicit diggers. But
the Sierra Leone government was reluctant to take decisive action and it
took many months of discussions by Sir Philip to persuade it to seal its
borders and choke off ''submarine goods'' finding their way to Europe.
To celebrate successful negotiations, he was given a present of a
nubile 16-year-old at the airport to his huge embarrassment. She was
taken off the plane just before it began taxi-ing -- to the huge
enjoyment of the assembled chiefs in on the jape.
However the greatest coup, as far as is known in the public domain,
was almost as soon as a major diamond find was discovered in Siberia.
Sir Philip was able to persuade the Soviet Union it was in its best
interests that all its exports were sold through the CSO.
To provide substance to the myth during the Cold War that the Soviets
did not trade with South Africa, a company owned by Hambros Bank was
established in London to handle the transactions. There were predictably
stormy sessons which on one occasion resulted in Sir Philip's walking
away from the negotiating table -- a risky move as the Russians could
have broken the CSO through flooding the markets with their increasing
production. But the hard-faced men from Moscow backed down.
However that bravura and courage were not surprising from a man who
had already achieved so much. Born in 1911, the son of Otto, a brother
of Ernest Oppenheimer and Beatrice Oppenheimer, Philip was educated at
Harrow and Jesus College, Cambridge, where he studied history and law
and captained the university boxing team. He joined the army as a
private in 1939 and soon became a sergeant major. He eventually joined
the Combined Operations, rising to become a lieutenant-colonel and
winning a Bronze Cross in both Sicily and Holland.
While cousin Harry Oppenheimer, chairman of both De Beers and the
interlinked Anglo American Corporation, was, and is, multi-faceted, Sir
Philip had only two main interests. He was in the fortunate position of
being able to use the wealth gained from one love -- diamonds -- to
support the other -- the turf.
Horses have been a major preoccupation of the Oppenheimer family. That
has been most evident in Britain, with Sir Philip, an owner-breeder with
black and white halved colours, finding it none too difficult to
persuade De Beers to sponsor the King George V and Queen Elizabeth
Stakes at Ascot, the latter beginning in 1972. He had one or two notable
successes such as Ile de Bourbon's winning the second-mentioned race in
1978. He also had a Derby runner-up as well as the 1982 1000 Guineas
Prize with On the House.
He leaves his widow, Pamela, whom he married in 1935, and has a son
Anthony, who is a director of De Beers, and a daughter.

Hugh Charles, songwriter and theatre producer; born 1907, died October
6, 1995
HUGH CHARLES, theatrical producer and song-writer, who wrote such
popular songs as We'll Meet Again, There'll Always Be An England, and
Silver Wings in the Moonlight, has died at 88 in hospital at Eastbourne.
Known to his friends as ''Hughie'', Manchester-born Charles was a
talented musician who appeared in variety halls in the 1920s, plugging
songs on the piano for major music publishers, contracting well-known
artists and big bands to do likewise.
At the beginning of the Second World War, he joined the Jack Hylton
Organisation, becoming general manager of that company for 20 years.
He brought productions of the revue show The Fol-De-Rols to Edinburgh,
Glasgow, and Aberdeen, and was married to Joan Mann, a favourite with
Scottish audiences at Glasgow's King's and Alhambra theatres.
His friend Hugh Johnson, of Kelvindale, Glasgow, describes him as ''a
kindly man, 6ft 4in tall, handsome and distinguished-looking, who
started out in the song-plugging business and enjoyed success with songs
that became the nation's favourites.''
His wartime songs were given great exposure during the recent VE-Day
celebrations. Although We'll Meet Again was the best-known, taken up
with great acclaim by Vera Lynn after early exposure in radio shows by
the late Dorothy Ward, other songs written or co-written by Charles
include Blue Skies Around The Corner, Russian Rose, Memories Last Longer
Than Dreams, When They Sound the Last All Clear, The King Is Still in
London, and Ma, I Miss Your Apple Pie.
Charles wrote There'll Always Be An England in 1937, not as the
rousing marching song it became, but as a song of peace during the tense
years before the war with Hitler. It was first performed before an
audience of 3000 people by the combined Billy Cotton band and the Van
Damm orchestra, and became an immediate hit. Hugh Charles's songs were
played regularly by the BBC, and established themselves as favourites in
dance halls throughout Britain and also with servicemen overseas.
His duties involved looking after the legendary Crazy Gang at the
Victoria Palace and also Hylton's revivals of big musicals, as well as
new shows such as Take It From Here, Paint Your Wagon, Kismet, Can Can,
The Blue Lamp, and many pantomimes.
When the Hylton empire came to a close, Hugh Charles became the owner
of The Fol-De-Rols and for 20 years often produced three summer editions
and a long winter tour, taking in Aberdeen, Edinburgh,
Newcastle-upon-Tyne, and Glasgow.
He leaves his wife Joan and three sons from a previous marriage.

William Gordon Williams, OBE; born June 28, 1920, in Wales, died
October 1, 1995
WILLIAM WILLIAMS OBE, former HM Inspector of Mines and Quarries for
Scotland, has died at the age of 75. During his long career in the
mining industry, he was respected by management, the National Union of
Mineworkers, and miners themselves in his efforts to improve safety both
on the surface and underground in Scotland's collieries and mines.
Born in Wales, he moved to Scotland in 1956 to head the inspectorate,
and was only three years later involved in extensive inquiries into the
Auchengeich disaster in which 48 men died.
He was also involved in the Michael Colliery fire disaster in 1967, in
which nine men lost their lives, and at Seafield Colliery, also in Fife,
in 1973 when five miners died in a coal face collapse. In all cases,
major safety measures were introduced.
For his efforts in the field of safety in mines and quarries, he was
made an OBE in the Birthday Honours of 1975.
During his career he was a supporter of the Institution of Mining,
Electrical and Mechanical Engineers, serving in the sixties as president
of its Lothian branch. He was also a chartered engineer of the
Institution of Mechanical Engineers, and a fellow of Mining Engineers.
Praising his input to the industry, Mr George Bolton, president of the
Scottish NUM, said that he was very well respected throughout his career
by everyone who knew him.
Mr Williams is survived by his wife, Theresa, and two daughters.

CONFIDENCE is rising in the manufacturing and tourism sectors of the
Scottish economy, according to the Scottish Chambers' Business Survey,
for the July-September quarter.
But confidence in the construction, retail and wholesaling sectors
fell in the same period, the survey conducted by the Fraser of Allander
Institute finds.
The bounce-back in manufacturing optimism follows four consecutive
quarters in which the rate at which confidence was growing slowed until,
in the April-June quarter this year, it remained flat.
This time a net balance of 12% of manufacturers said they were more
optimistic than three months earlier. That optimism appears to be based
on increased orders and sales in the rest of the UK and overseas. Orders
and sales for domestic Scottish customers again fell.
Optimism in the tourism and leisure sector again showed a strongly
positive picture, with a balance of 23% of respondents more optimistic
than three months before, compared with a net positive balance of 33% in
the second quarter.
In line with other recent evidence, optimism in construction fell
faster than it did in quarter two. The net balance of 28% reporting
lower optimism compared with a negative balance of 14% three months
before, although new orders actually fell at a slower rate than in
quarter two.
Scotland's retailers were again less optimistic about prospects,
although the balance reporting concern, at 10%, was lower than the 14%
reported three months earlier. That reflects a slower downward trend in
actual sales. The Fraser of Allander economists said there was evidence
of greater optimism among larger retail groups.
Wholesalers reported higher sales but, perversely, remained, on
balance, less optimistic than they were in the previous quarter.
The acting director of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce, Peter Dunn,
said he was generally pleased with the findings, particularly given the
employment potential in manufacturing and tourism. But he added: ''The
Scottish economy continues to be a tightrope balancing act.''
He warned that construction could be slumping into crisis at a time
when homelessness is a major social problem. He called for some
government solution, such as a reduction of VAT in the construction
sector, to bridge the two issues.
The survey found slight signs of an upward movement in pay in some
sectors and an upward trend in employment in tourism, manufacturing, and
wholesaling. Employment declined in finance, construction, and retail.
The use of temporary and part-time staff was stronger than full-time
recruitment in most sectors.
For Fraser of Allander, director Brian Ashcroft pointed out that, with
the exception of retailing, the out-turn in the third quarter had been
better than was anticipated by firms in the second quarter.
He said the findings were consistent with the institute's own view
that the Scottish economy may well out-perform the UK economy this year,
although growth will be lower than in 1994.
The number of respondents in the latest survey, at 830, was well down
on the 1000-plus replies usually received. Whether this was due to a
subsidiary exercise to poll business attitudes on Scottish
constitutional reform (the findings of which have yet to be revealed) or
general survey fatigue is not clear.

Gordon Hislop, journalist; born September 10, 1924, Glasgow, died
October 9, 1995
GORDON HISLOP, who has died at the age of 71, was for many years one
of Scotland's leading showbusiness journalists. He wrote a weekly column
for the Scottish Sunday Express from the mid-fifties until his early
retirement at 60 in 1984.
He had served in the Royal Navy towards the end of the Second World
War. When he was demobbed he became a reporter and features writer on
the Sunday Post in Glasgow before joining the Express in 1953.
A keen golfer, once playing off a handicap of four, he was a former
captain of Lenzie Golf Club near Glasgow, and he wrote the history of
the club to coincide with its centenary celebrations. He was a regular
competitor in Pro-Am golf charity events and in the 1970 Sean Connery
Tournament at Troon found himself drawn to play with Tony Jacklin, then
holder of both the Open and the US Open championship titles. Making up
the trio was comedian Bruce Forsyth.
He confessed to being very nervous before teeing up because his group
was attracting the greatest attention of the day. But at the first par
three hole he was the only one to make a birdie and he then settled down
to enjoy the outing.
After retiring he moved to the present family home at Strathkinness,
near St Andrews, and continued to write occasionally on a freelance
basis.
Three years ago Mr Hislop was diagnosed as having Alzheimer's disease
and had been in hospital since February of this year. He is survived by
his wife,Margaret, daughter Marianne, and son David.

John (Roy) Buchanan Rankin, BL, former secretary of the Bank of
Scotland; born July 29, 1911, died October 5, 1995
JOHN BUCHANAN RANKIN, a former secretary of the Bank of Scotland and a
dedicated follower of the arts, has died in Edinburgh. He was 84.
''Roy'' Rankin, as he was known, was born in Glasgow and was educated
at Glasgow High School. He left school at the age of 17 to join the
staff of the Union Bank of Scotland and gained a Bachelor of Law at
Glasgow University while working at the bank.
He became the Union Bank's assistant secretary in 1947 and in 1953 at
the age of 41 was appointed its secretary. In 1955 when the Union Bank
and the Bank of Scotland joined forces, he became secretary of the
merged Bank of Scotland and held this position until his retirement in
1971, the year when the Bank of Scotland merged with the British Linen
Bank.
Mr Rankin's enthusiasm for the arts was wide-ranging. He joined the
Society of the Edinburgh International Festival in 1967 and remained a
member until his death. He served as a member of the Festival Council,
1968-71. He was treasurer of the Scottish National Orchestra from 1959
to 1964 and chairman of Edinburgh's Gateway Theatre, the repertory
theatre run by the Church of Scotland in the 1950s and 1960s.
He served also on the council of the Scottish Arts Council and the
board of the Edinburgh's Royal Lyceum Theatre, and was president of the
Friends of the Royal Museum of Scotland.
Historical matters and all things Scottish came within the scope of
his interests, as was evidenced by his membership of the Saltire
Society. He was chairman of its Edinburgh branch and a member of its
council, and was the society's honorary secretary for two years.
He served as a member of the board of Livingston Development
Corporation. Mr Jim Pollock, the present chief executive, said Mr Rankin
was one of the board members responsible for the establishment of the
new town and his dedication had helped to pave the way for the success
of Livingston in the past 30 years.
Mr Rankin was an elder of St Giles', Edinburgh, for 15 years and was a
trustee of the Church Hymnary. During the 1930s he was an officer of the
Boys' Brigade in Glasgow.
In 1957 he married Mairi Pirie, who was the first full-time lecturer
in the school of drama at the Royal College of Music in Glasgow, now the
Royal College of Music and Drama. Mrs Rankin survives her husband.
A former colleague said that Mr Rankin did a lot of work for the arts
in an unobtrusive way. Another friend said he was kindly, well-meaning,
and amiable.

PRIVATISED UTILITIES
THE merry-go-round of electricity bids took another turn yesterday
with North West Water making a new, higher offer for Norweb, a regional
electricity company (REC) in North-west England. Norweb said it intended
to recommend that shareholders accept the offer.
The new offer values each Norweb share at 1170p and the entire company
at #1826m and represents a premium of 85p to rival bidder Texas Energy's
increased offer of 1085p per Norweb share. Norweb's shares reacted to
the latest bid developments by jumping 61p to 1147p.
North West Water is offering 3910p in cash and two new North West
Water shares for every five Norweb. In addition, Norweb shareholders
will be able to receive an increased special dividend of 150p per Norweb
share.
There is a further revised cash alternative of 1000p per Norweb share
which, together with the increased special dividend, values each Norweb
share at 1150p. Its broker, Kleinwort Benson, was seen in the market
buying shares at this price.
The revised offer also includes a loan note alternative and an option
for shareholders to take bonds in the National Grid, in which Norweb has
a stake. National Grid, the power transmission network in England and
Wales is due to be floated in the near future.
Commenting on the offer, Brian Staples, chief executive of North West
Water, said the utility created by the merger of North West Water and
Norweb with their substantially overlapping customer bases will be well
placed to deliver efficiency savings which will bring benefits to
customers and shareholders.
''This offer by North West Water for Norweb represents a significant
increase and a full price which we believe should be decisive in
securing for our shareholders the benefits which will arise from
combining the two businesses,'' he added.
Taking into account the terms of the new offer, the Norweb acquisition
is expected to be earnings enhancing in the first full year following
acquisition.
North West Water's directors believe that the interest cover and
gearing of the enlarged group will remain prudent. Tomorrow, North West
Water shareholders will get the chance to vote on the desirability of
the acquisition of Norweb in an EGM.
Since its bid was formally announced on September 8, North West Water
has bought 18.2 million Norweb shares in the market representing about
11.7% of the electricity company's share capital. On October 9, North
West had valid acceptances for just under 0.5% of its issued share
capital, giving North West about 12% of its bid target.

Patric Walker, astrologer; born September 25, 1931, died October 8,
1995
ASTROLOGER Patric Walker, the man who made predictions about the lives
of a billion people, has died at his South Kensington home in London at
the age of 64. He contracted salmonella during the summer and the
infection proved impossible to shake off. He had undergone bypass
surgery five years ago after a heart attack.
During his 20-year career, his horoscopes were read by an estimated
one billion people worldwide. He popularised the newspaper horoscope and
helped make the public more aware of their birth signs. His predictions
appeared on Independent Television's Teletext, in the Evening Standard
and the Mail on Sunday, as well as being syndicated to magazines and
national and regional newspapers around the world.
Born in New Jersey, USA, Patric Walker had grown up in Whitby,
Yorkshire, and worked as a barman and property developer, amongst other
things, before encountering the astrologer Celeste at a dinner party and
discovering his own destiny.
He began writing for the magazine, Nova, before taking over Celeste's
column in Harpers and Queen, moving to the Mirror Magazine, and then
joining Associated Newspapers.
Walker -- a Libran born on September 25 -- refused to appear on
television and did not write books, but still made millions from his
horoscopes. Since 1970, he spent most of his time in the remote village
of Lindos, on the Greek island of Rhodes, where he rented a modest house
from a local family.
He moved, he said, because of middle-age panic. ''It's extremely hard
to be perceived as someone who is always right,'' he explained. ''I was
expected to be infallible and it made me start drinking.'' Having become
on his own admission ''a terrible drunk,'' he gave up alcohol nine years
ago.
His explanation for the contemporary interest in astrology was that
people felt they were losing control of their lives. There were, he
believed, only four problems in the world -- ''love, health, work, and
money -- in that order.'' He said he was not ''dabbling in entrails''
but ''looking at the rhythms, the natural timing of things.''
In his last telephone forecast for those seeking guidance, he
ironically told his fellow Librans: ''You have uttered your final word
over a family matter. Voices off may bring echoes of another world but
you remain grounded in the here and now.''
A spokesman for Teletext, where his star sign predictions were read by

Duncan Grant, Highland Regional Councillor for North West Skye: an
appreciation
DUNCAN GRANT, the member of Highland Regional Council for North West
Skye died recently while on holiday.
Initially as councillor for the Lochalsh area, this former forester
led a small band of mainly west-coast councillors on Highland Regional
Council who fought against the imposition of tolls on the Kyle Of
Lochalsh/Syke bridge.
They were to be out-voted 38-7 by their colleagues, some of whom had
travelled by way of two toll-free bridges to Inverness to vote for tolls
for the people of Skye.
Duncan Grant's opposition to the tolls was widely respected, even
within the Scottish Office where he was viewed as a principled opponent.
In the end he was to oppose the running of a ferry in competition to the
bridge, because it would extend the payback period, but he never gave up
the fight to get the tolls removed.
The Highlands will miss his considerable political skills, but not
nearly as much as the humour, integrity, and generosity of spirit that
was the man.

Detective Sergeant Tommy Taylor aims to be the eyes and ears of
Scotland's police force. Stephen McGinty talks to the NCIS officer on
his vital role in stamping out drug-related and organised crime
DETECTIVE Sergeant Tommy Taylor can look round the world at a glance.
It's just A few strides for the former Motherwell-beat bobby to Spain.
France sits neatly beside Sweden and Norway. Italy, Germany and
Australia are separated by seconds and all other nations are a few taps
on a touch-tone telephone. In the sharp new London offices of the
National Criminal Intelligence Service, Taylor is Scotland.
His desk is a short-bread tin. It has been dipped in the saltire then
wrapped in tartan; posters and tourism brochures peek out and loom over
desk drawers. The tartan treatment followed unsuccessful office visits
by international dignitaries who were swept past with only the slightest
glance.
Now they stop and talk, and Taylor will schmooze, and when he needs
crucial information, advice or a surveillance team they will help. For
though his previous personas have included talking tough to drug dealers
in Paisley and dealing with drunks at Motherwell Cross, his current role
is equally crucial. In the information age, Taylor is a conduit between
the forces of law and the ''bad guys who deserve the jail''.
Organised crime is an expanding threat. The collapse of Eastern Europe
has resulted in criminal gangs trafficking in radioactive and nuclear
substances, vehicles, prostitutes, guns, money, and drugs which splash
from Europe to Britain.
The bulk of Scotland's drugs are coming via England and the Continent.
Though NCIS deals in all serious crime, 60% of their work is drug
related. NCIS's job of converting information into crucial police
intelligence has never been more vital.
It is expected that within two years Scotland will have its own NCIS
office. The new centre would also house the Scottish Criminal
Intelligence Office, despite fears that it might mean a loss of
independence. NCIS staff are responsible to the Home Secretary. While a
final decision has not yet been made by the Scottish Office despite
pressure by Scotland's police chiefs, Taylor is convinced of its
importance.
''What we do is take a little bit of weight off the guy on the beat.
He doesn't need to spend time trying to gather together all the
intelligence. We can get experts in this field who do that for him. Then
we can walk up to him when he's along Argyle Street and say: 'Willie
Smith is a bad man; he is going to be in that pub at this time and he's
carrying 40 kilos of drugs that he got from this man in Holland. Now you
go and deal with it.' He's not had to research it; we've been doing that
for the past six months.''
NCIS can, of course, do little else. It is under the direct
responsibility, through director-general Albert Pacey, of the Home
Secretary, Michael Howard. It has no powers to arrest criminals. Until
recently it was unable to even follow a suspected criminal under
surveillance.
Yet since its birth on April Fool's Day in 1992, NCIS has become the
final layer of the intelligence tiers. Information from existing
bureaux, such as Force Intelligence and Regional Criminal Intelligence
Offices from around the country was brought together, creating a
nationwide map of criminal activities which would allow further
information to flow to and from Europe and the world via individual
countries plus Interpol and Europol.
A tour with Taylor will lead you through the worst of
twentieth-century crime, from drug dealers to biker gangs, yet all you
will see is smartly-dressed men and women sitting in front of computer
screens. Intelligence will always lie under the surface. Any source of
information from criminals, journalists, politicians are points to be
examined. In 1994-95 Taylor received 332 intelligence reports related to
organised crime in Scotland; the previous year the figure had been 207
reports.
On a Tuesday afternoon Taylor flies to London. After a briefing from
his colleague -- two Scots officers work alternate weeks -- he will deal
with 30 to 40 international inquiries per day from Scottish and Northern
Irish police and Customs officers. His job is to decide the best means
of fixing them up with other operational officers from Interpol, Europol
or the Drugs Liaison network.
It is a 12-hour day -- on call round the clock -- where the buzz of
the bust is replaced by a sharp view of the bigger picture.
After three days off, Taylor will spend the remaining time touring
various Scottish squads and forces updating current operations and
sorting problems. In Northern Ireland he delivers regular lectures at
drugs courses. The ceasefire has brought the comfort of a Belfast hotel
bed; previously he was billeted at Antrim Road Police Station.
To Taylor the world is divided into ''good guys'', ''bad guys'' and
the ''jail'' where the bad guys belong. He joined the police as a cadet
with 10 years in uniform followed in 1984 by promotion to Motherwell
CID, then Detective Constable in the drugs unit.
For two years he ran a drugs unit in Paisley, co-ordinating 60
officers in drug busts and successfully tailing suspects on 800-mile
round trips to London, finally to nail them with 40 kilos in their car
or home. Then he applied for the post he has now held for 15 months, the
three to five-year posting with NCIS. Crime-cracking is chess to Taylor,
and now he is simply on a bigger board. The motives remain the same.
''It's about pitting your wits against somebody who is a criminal. It
is like a game of chess. The difference is they don't need to conform to
any laws or rules and we have do.''

BANKS
THE City has given the thumbs up to the proposed #15.5bn Lloyds Bank
and TSB merger under the Lloyds TSB Group holding company, encouraged by
the promise of #350m of annual savings by 1999.
There was also vague speculation that there could be a counter-bid for
TSB from National Bank of Australia which already owns the Clydesdale
Bank, Yorkshire Bank and the Northern Bank in Ulster, although many
thought that unlikely as it would result in massive closure costs due to
the heavy overlap of branches. In contrast, Lloyds is an almost perfect
geographic fit.
The terms of the offer are much as indicated on Monday with existing
TSB shareholders to have one new Lloyds TSB Group share and 68.3p cash
in exchange for each existing share.
Lloyds shareholders will be given 2.704 shares for each Lloyds share
now held but no special dividend.
TSB shares jumped 19p to 369p while Lloyds' were 49p better at 769p.
The offer currently values each TSB share at 352p so there is the
possibility of a third party intervening. In contrast bid hopes
temporarily evaporated from the Royal Bank of Scotland which fell back
10p to 483p.
Technically the TSB is taking over Lloyds to protect the interests of
the four TSB charitable foundations although the power will reside with
Lloyds.
Lloyds chairman Sir Robin Ibbs said that the small business customers
would do well due to the economies of scale and a wide range of
financial services. There will be comprehensive coverage throughout
Britain giving customers easy access to group services, while Cheltenham
&amp; Gloucester mortgages will be available throughout the combined network
of 2950 retail branches.
The enlarged bank will have more than 16 million customers.
Sir Robin will be the chairman while the deputy chairmen will be
Lloyds' John Davies and present TSB chairman Sir Nicholas Goodison.
The most significant move is that while Sir Brian Pitman predictably
becomes chief executive he will have as one of his deputies the TSB's
Peter Ellwood. He has been largely responsible for pulling the once
ailing group back on to its feet and was flushed with embarrassment
yesterday when it was put to him that he was now the natural successor
to Sir Brian whose retirement has been postponed since 1991.
He is also benefiting from share options which would be worth about
#1.8m.
Sir Nicholas said he had had discussions with building societies but
these were very difficult to dislodge and also very expensive.
TSB Scotland will remain an independent entity within the enlarged
group.
As it is impossible to move customer accounts from the TSB to the new
group, it will require an Act of Parliament to legally complete the
merger. That is expected to take about two years.
Sir Brian said he was interested only in stable earnings and would not
be buying an investment bank where profitablity could be very volatile.
However, he is anxious to build up TSB's Hill Samuel merchant banking
subsidiary which is fee earning from corporate finance, fund management
and private banking.

SHIPBUILDING
KVAERNER Govan managing director Kjell Mikalsen yesterday said the
Clydeside yard was hopeful of clinching a multi-million pound order for
up to two chemical tankers within the next few weeks.
He also revealed that a #60m order for a satellite launcher support
vessel, announced last month by Britain's biggest commercial
shipbuilder, would not be confirmed for another five weeks.
The combined orders would secure the 1200 jobs at the yard until 1998.
Mr Mikalsen commented before the launch of a 20,500-tonne Landing
Platform Helicopter carrier at the yard -- the first Royal Navy vessel
to be built under a joint contract involving a commercial and naval
shipyard.
He said one of the conditions of the Govan yard securing a forthcoming
EU shipbuilding subsidy of 9% was that is should deliver new orders
before 1998.
''It means we would need two or three contracts on top of the Sea
Launch satellite launcher vessel.
''Within a few weeks we should have another contract for perhaps one
or two chemical tankers.''
Confirmation of the satellite launcher contract had been put back
until November 15 to allow the lead partner in the Sea Launch consortium
-- the US aircraft giant Boeing -- time to secure firm orders for the
project and adequate financing.
Mr Mikalsen said he remained hopeful that the contract would be
confirmed.
He said the Govan yard would also compete for the contract to build
two Royal Navy Fleet Auxiliary oilers -- large refuelling vessels. The
contracts are expected to be issued in the second half of next year.
The 20,500-tonne helicopter carrier launched at Govan yesterday --
which is understood to have cost #149m -- was the first naval vessel to
be built at the Govan yard -- Britain's largest commercial shipbuilder
-- since 1970.
The carrier is the first dedicated and purpose-built amphibious
helicopter carrier for the Royal Navy, designed to achieve the rapid
landing of an assault force by helicopter.
The vessel, which will have worldwide capability, will be able to
transport and sustain an embarked military force of up to 800 men with
equipment, artillery, vehicles, and stores. It will carry helicopters as
well as assault and landing craft and has provision for Sea Harriers and
for the next generation Attack Helicopter.
It is being built in conjunction with the Barrow-in-Furness-based VSEL
-- builder of the Royal Navy's Trident missile submarines -- and will
remain on the Clyde until next summer to allow the fitting of
non-military equipment, including most of the electrical, firefighting,
ventilation, and air-conditioning systems.
It is expected that the ship will then sail to the VSEL naval shipyard
where all military hardware, including weapons and combat systems, will
be installed before it is officially named HMS Ocean and handed over to
the Ministry of Defence.
Mr Mikalsen said yesterday: ''The work we have done with the
helicopter carrier proves that it is possible to use modern commercial
shipbuilding technology to reduce defence costs. We will be providing
VSEL with a technically sophisticated value-for-money vessel.''
Mr Mikalsen, pointing out that the Glasgow yard's history had included
the construction of almost 200 submarines, aircraft carriers and
battleships, said it was not Kvaerner Govan's intention to compete
exclusively for naval work where commercial standards were not required.
He added, however: ''We have demonstrated that we can build a vessel
such as the helicopter carrier to the highest level of commercial and
classification standards which can then be developed for military use.''
The Norwegian-owned Kvaerner Govan yard last month secured a #60m
order for a roll-on roll-off ferry support vessel for the commercial
satellite launching installation against competition from its sister
yard in Germany.

SHE weighs a hefty 20,500 tonnes and is a substantial 600ft long --
but Hull 309 is the most beautiful sight a Glasgow shipyard has seen in
25 years.
For the giant helicopter carrier tied up at Govan shipyard's quayside
is the first naval vessel to have been built at the yard since 1970.
The River Clyde was blocked for two hours yesterday afternoon, as the
108ft wide vessel slipped into the water and lumbered into position.
The Landing Platform Helicopter Carrier, built for the Royal Navy,
will stay at Govan for another eight months, while she is outfitted with
non-military equipment -- including most of the electrical,
firefighting, ventilation and air-conditioning systems.
After the launch the delighted managing director of Kvaerner Govan,
Kjell Mikalsen, revealed the contract would earn the yard #80m. ''We are
going to have a party tonight,'' he said.
Yesterday's jubilation was a far cry from the dark days of 1988,
before the Norwegian company stepped in, when it looked as if the yard
would go under.
Mr Mikalsen said Govan had been making a profit since 1993. ''I think
we are okay now. Of course, you need the orders but the future, I think,
is fairly bright.''
Hull 309 is scheduled to sail to Barrow-in-Furness next summer to be
given her military equipment, official launch and proper name.

THE reality of drug trafficking and money laundering in Scotland, and
throughout Britain, is exemplified in the recent case involving Robert
Maxwell, the Possilpark drug dealer who bragged to fellow remand
prisoners in the Barlinnie cells that he would still be a millionaire
when he came out of jail.
The chances are that he will not, but then this is not the first time
he has got it wrong. Maxwell, a few months into his 12-year sentence for
possession of heroin with a street value of #2.5m, was simply unaware
that the axe was about to fall.
Back in the summer he had been targeted by surveillance officers from
Strathclyde Police. No criminal believes he will be caught, far less
caught red-handed in the exchange of drugs and cash.
The fact is that Maxwell was trapped as a result of the 1988 Criminal
Justice (Scotland) Act; concerned by the enormous sums of money being
handled by a man who had no visible business, a bank manager blew the
whistle to Strathclyde Police's financial investigation unit. By voicing
his suspicions he was simply doing his duty under the law.
This disclosure, on a statutory form on which details of the bank
manager's concerns are outlined, provided the baseline intelligence
which led to the swoop on Maxwell.
In the end he threw up his hands and pleaded guilty.
The powers contained in the 1995 Criminal Justice Act, which come into
force next April in Scotland, enhance those which already existed under
the 1988 law which gave the police powers to go for the confiscation of
the proceeds of drug dealing.
Scottish police realise that they now have in their hands one of the
most powerful weapons ever accorded them. It has opened up a new ball
game, and they have the ball.
After a slow start disclosures are pouring in. Last year Strathclyde
Police's financial investigation unit -- an offshoot of Fraud Squad
personnel -- received about 300, but this year the figure already stands
at more than 480. Practically every one of these disclosures, from
banks, accountants, other financial institutions and even solicitors,
merits an inquiry at some level and many of them supplement an
investigation which is already under way.
As the rate of disclosure speeds up so the enhanced intelligence
systems in the Scottish forces are coming into their own. Traditionally,
a major obstruction to successful policing throughout the UK was the
institutionalised mistrust and rivalry between different departments
within the same force, but that is vanishing from the police culture, or
at least diminishing.
The seizure of assets has to be linked directly to a specific crime --
a safeguard which speaks for itself -- but even if the police are unable
to do that in the short term in specific cases, they still have the
intelligence in the kitty for some future date.
To meet the new situation one major English force has scrapped its
fraud squad and turned it over to investigating financial disclosure.
Forces here are in the process of beefing up fraud squads. Because
resources are so limited it invariably means that, in order to take
advantage of the possibilities, police forces are having to prioritise
crime. Often something else will have to go by the board.
Detectives, however, are pleased. ''There is a level of resistance
from some bank managers who still believe that client confidentiality is
sacred, regardless of their suspicions, and that they might even be sued
if they disclosed someone's business to a third party,'' one officer
told The Herald.
''There is also a fear that their bank will get a name in the business
community for making disclosures. In the main we are in partnership with
the banks. If everyone came onside with this legislation there would be
no place left for the criminal to hide. If I were a drug dealer I would
be getting worried.''
The Possil drug dealer, Maxwell, used a primitive means to launder his
ill-gotten gains. He did not use drugs but he was addicted to gambling.
In five years he is thought to have laundered about #6.5m through
bookmaker's shops, much of it locally in the Possil area, simply by
betting very large cash sums on odds-on horses. He was willing to take a
drop of around a third -- a fairly typical laundering ''commission'' --
in order to end up with ''clean'' bookies' cheques.
It is not unknown for major criminals to take over the bookie's
business through surrogates in order to bet the crime proceeds in his
own shop, cleaning the money in the process.
The presiding judge in the case later heard the civil action at which
confiscation was sought and the police are now on the track of Maxwell's
assets, including secret bank accounts.
There is a strong feeling throughout Scottish forces that, if full use
is to be made of the legislation, particularly now that it extends to
all crime, resources will have to be made available. The alternative
would be to divert personnel from other forms of policing.
Multi-disciplinary approaches are needed, possibly involving outside
agencies such as the security service, the National Crime Intelligence
Service and the prosecution service itself.

Ian Bruce examines the Defence Secretary's worrying overestimate of
British military might
MICHAEL Portillo is a dangerous man. People with delusions of
grandeur, or in his case, adequacy, usually are. It is perhaps just as
well that Britain's military capabilities come nowhere close to matching
the new Defence Secretary's inflated impression of them.
He delivered his keynote speech at the Tory party conference on
Tuesday with all the fervour of a small boy immersed in a game of
cowboys and Indians. It was circle the wagons time. The UK would stand
alone against the foreign hordes, and even carry the fight to them in a
projection of power across the globe.
Portillo announced the formation of a 20,000-man British Rapid
Deployment Force to include all three services. What he did not announce
was how that relatively puny formation would be transported to an area
of conflict.
If all of Nato's European resources were added together, there would
not be sufficient airlift capability to take a single, understrength,
vulnerable British force to war without American aid.
In the Gulf war, Britain supplied a single armoured division which was
a third short of its projected wartime strength. To achieve that much,
British Army of the Rhine was stripped of every serviceable tank, shell
and bullet.
If the Soviets had crossed the West German frontier in the spring of
1991 there would have been little to stop them. The entire Nato-Warsaw
Pact confrontation was based on bluff. If the West's bluff had been
called, nuclear war would have been the only option.
When it appeared in action in Saudi Arabia, the British 1st Armoured
Division was fleshed out by the addition of an American brigade. The
Desert Rats were the Desert Scavengers. It was not the fault of the
military. The Treasury runs the Defence Ministry.
Sadly, Portillo is the small boy with the Airfix fort, a supply of
plastic figures, and an ill-informed view of the art of the possible.
The Falklands looms large in his Thatcher-inspired approach to the new
job.
Reality is that the British Army is now smaller than most Third World
forces. By next year, there will be 119,000 British troops. Fewer than
half of that total are combat soldiers.
The man in charge of the military toybox is full of ambition. But the
toybox is light on manpower and even lighter on power projection. The UK
is buying hi-tech weaponry at the expense of what really matters, the
men behind the bayonets.
The Falklands, Portillo's role model, was won by a tired, hungry, cold
and exhausted force. Victory was due more to desperation than loyalty to
the Crown. Paras and Marines who had yomped across the islands and
fought with bayonet and grenade for mountain positions were motivated
more by sheer survival and the desire to finish the business and go home
in one piece.
Since 1982, the UK has lost so much of its commercial shipbuilding
infrastructure that it would no longer be possible to mount a maritime
operation on the same scale as the Falklands without hiring foreign
ships in large numbers to transport a force which might be incapable of
defeating Fiji on its own beaches.
The ultimate irony is that Britain possesses a Trident ballistic
missile submarine flotilla with the power to devastate most of Russia or
anywhere else. At the same time, the propellant powder for its
infantry's rifle bullets has to be imported from Holland. We could end
life as we know it on this planet yet we might not be able to hold a
mountain bunker in Bosnia against a platoon of drunken Serbs.
Portillo has either been briefed badly or has ignored the advice he
has been given. Britain cannot afford to be an independent mover and
shaker in the world any longer.
With no insult to overstretched armed forces, we are a Hollywood
power. There is a lot of front with very little substance.
At the height of the ''independent'' deterrent represented by Polaris
missiles, Britain relied on American satellites for guidance to target.
Now we buy the missiles direct from America and still count on their
co-operation when there is no discernible enemy.
Portillo's view is Roke's Drift. Britain won that one in extra time,
but only just. A British military establishment divorced from Europe and
America is a pipedream. First World War French Premier ''Tiger''
Clemenceau once said that war was too important to be left to generals.
We can only hope that it is also too important to be left to the
nouveau-MoD.

IT must have been a slow day inspiration-wise when a Disney executive
came up with the idea of making a film about Pocahontas: Hey, guys,
here's a cute little tale of debauchery and paedophilia for all the
family, a stunning story of degradation and brute exploitation we can
turn into a surefire winner, with just a little tweak here and there.
You bet. A Native Indian child forced to marry a lecherous colonist,
torn from her tribe, converted to Christianity, kidnapped and shipped to
these shores to be trawled around for the bawdy amusement of the
aristocracy, before dying, home and heart sick, at the age of 22 in
Gravesend in Kent.
The true story of Pocahontas is a small, sorry, squalid episode in our
colonial history. She was the daughter of an Indian chief, Powhatan, who
lived with her peaceable tribe by the banks of the Chickahominy in
Virginia. In 1607 a bunch of adventurers and would-be colonists landed
at Chesapeake Bay with an expedition under Captain Bartholomew Gosnold.
They were to establish a settlement, all 105 of them. Provisions,
though, were scanty, and sickness soon rife within the stockade.
The colonists were inexperienced and poorly equipped, in all senses.
It fell to one of their number, Captain John Smith, an egocentric toff,
to elect himself leader and go off in search of food.
He set off to trade with the Indians for provisions to keep the
settlers alive. Smith used all the usual means at his disposal,
cajolery, force, and fraud, along with exhortations of friendship, to
persuade the natives to hand over food and the means to keep the
colonists alive.
After one particular fall-out, during which he killed one of their
number, Powhatan, the great chief of a confederacy of Indians, kept him
captive while deciding what to do with him. He was held in the chief's
home, afforded his hospitality, and befriended by his 12-year-old
daughter Pocahontas.
Smith's undoubted charms seduced the kind-hearted child who was
thrilled by his stirring tales of derring-do and stories of the marvels
he had seen on his travels.
When Smith was led out to be executed, forced to kneel while his head
was laid on a stone before having his brains crushed with clubs,
Pocahontas sprang forward and seized his head in her arms. So grateful
was Smith that he persuaded her to marry a fellow colonist, John Rolfe.
The girl was christened into their faith, then, against her will,
shipped to England where she was cold and miserable and feted as a prize
ethnic oddity.
She never made it home and died at Gravesend in 1617, a victim of the
times and of history. Sad, then, that it's her ultimate fate to become
the victim of Disneyfication, right up there with the legendary Robin
Hood, anthromorphised into a fox, and Christopher Robin oddly affecting
a twangy New England accent.
The difference is that Pocahontas, unlike Winnie the Pooh and Sleeping
Beauty and Snow White was real, once. Now, by the power of Disney, she
has become pure invention. An imaginary device whose power is to part
you from your dosh. And in the process of viewing we are asked by the
Disney Corporation to collude into turning one of colonial history's
small tragedies into a cartoon fantasy.
In the film she marries Smith, not Rolfe, of course, for what's
reality when romance is at stake? And there is one more irony. Not a
single mention of the experience was made by Smith in his minute
personal narrative covering the period, nor in the recollections of his
comrades. The story first surfaced after Pocahontas died, in a book
Generall Historie published in 1624, with which Smith -- painted the
hero -- did not demur. Even then they were stealing her story.
There is nothing new of course in the Disney Corporation selling
fantasy. That's what it's built on, isn't it, a loving recreation of the
way Americans like to think their nation is, or once was, and ought to
be. Offering an idealised universe sanitised of all the nasty bits,
representing no historical truth save that of the corporation's zealous
pursuit of bigger and better profits. Questionable values imbued through
cuteness.
There is though something creepy behind the Disney cleanliness, in the
innocence enacted for commercial gain.
There is, too, something keenly surreal about Walt Disney's heirs
pledging #9000 to spotlight the English burial site of Pocahontas. It
will illuminate a history stolen by those for whom, like Pinnochio,
truth is just too much trouble.

ARE politics a matter of chance, coincidence, subjectives, personal
ambitions, whimsy, the fluctuating strengths of leaders, and other such
imponderables? Or is there any underlying logic to politics, a political
reality which objectively exists, in its own right, and is the basis of
all political allegiances?
If there is an answer to these questions it must surely lie in society
at large, in the character of political institutions. It's interesting
to view the two main parties in this country sociologically rather than
ideologically. To look at their actual social bases instead of accepting
what they say about themselves.
Labour's electoral strongholds are in urban conurbations where dwell
wage earners and their families. Tory electoral strongholds are in
suburban areas and shires where dwell salaried executives, high-paid
professionals, those who run or own businesses, big farmers, landowners,
and their staffs.
Is that a coincidence or do people identify with a political party
which represents their economic interests as individuals, and as members
of a social group or class which shares these economic interests?
If you have all the salient factors about a community such as the
social composition, value of homes, incomes, types of car, how many cars
per household, how many have second homes, the number of children that
go to fee-paying schools, etc, you can tell with some certainty whether
the community's MP is likely to be Tory or Labour.
To say therefore that politics in this country has nothing to do with
class is a lie. Thatcher was the most class-conscious of politicians. A
daughter of the lower middle class elevated to millionaire status
through marriage, she fought, red in tooth and claw, to add to and
consolidate her new-found status.
The nouveau riche generally tend to be insecure and lacking
savoir-faire and the social graces of old money. The recently made rich
are liable to worry themselves sick lest someone like Tony Benn, as
Chancellor, takes it all away. Lord Home never really bothered in his
shirt about such things. His family had seen off hundreds of Chancellors
and their wealth remained intact.
This is why new millionaires or aspiring millionaires are often more
royal than the queen, more Tory than real Tories. You can see them at
Blackpool this week. Insecurity has made them daft. They're afraid Tony
Blair is going to take away their money which must be some kind of
record for self deception.
Delegates in Blackpool clapped wildly when Michael Portillo, him with
the lips that make Mick Jagger look like George Robertson, told them
that ''We'', presumably meaning the Government, now had the
technological means of dropping a missile down someone's chimney within
a 1000-mile radius. I checked, we're within his range. Thank god I've
got central heating.
But think of it. They actually applauded and cheered at the thought of
a missile dropping down somebody's chimney. Don't tell me, they ain't
bonkers. A missile down a chimney, ha ha ha. Minister can you get it to
bounce into the middle of the living room before exploding and
splattering them against the walls? Hee hee hee. Stop it Michael, before
I pee my knickers.
Political parties, of course, espouse the interests of a social class
and codify these interests into general principles which they claim are
in the interests of all citizens. What's good for General Motors is good
for America, sort of thing.
Political parties make the economic interests of those they represent
a moral cause. Those who challenge these economic interests are
therefore subverting the moral code which sustains the highest form of
civilisation known to man, so it is implied.
The Tory social base is the ultra rich, who relatively speaking are
not that numerous. The party has historically had to persuade those who
are not ultra rich that the interests of the ultra rich are their
interests as well. The current recession, the worst since 1945, has
traumatised large sections of middle England, particularly in the south.
They thought they were fire proof. Permanent beneficiaries of the
system, palsy walsy with the ultra rich, and then they were made
redundant in droves. No prospects of a job. The property market
collapsed. A new phenomenon called negative equity haunts suburbia.
Mortgages are re-possessed. Homelessness in middle England!
The English middle class was in revolt. They felt betrayed and were
becoming increasingly anti-Tory. The English middle class defeated the
poll tax. All the ingredients were there for a major realignment in
British politics. The middle class would be prised once and for all from
Tory clutches.
Nothing clarifies the mind about the iniquities of social injustice
than having a short dose of it yourself. Labour had to convince middle
England that its values would enhance their role in society, give their
lives a new purpose, in a society which would combine the economic
efficiency of the market-place with social priorities based on personal
and social need, not private greed. Demonstrate the superiority of the
socialist ethic at work, in a regulated market economy.
But Blair and his mates have blown it. They've rejected socialism.
They present themselves to middle England as better Tories than the
Tories. They pander to what's bad in the middle classes instead of
appealing to what's good.
In the meantime Labour's social base, wage earners and their families,
and those who would be wage earners if they weren't unemployed, are
being alienated. In time this rock-like fount of Labour's vote will
start to erode. It's already started. It's enough to make you drink. I
think I'll have a right good bevvy with George Foulkes.
Apropos absolutely nothing, did you read the report which claimed,
''Men in Manchester would rather go on holiday with Eric Cantona . . .
than with Cindy Crawford or Claudia Schiffer''. What the hell is
happening? Is the world going mad? Cancel that party with George
Foulkes, get me Hurricane Higgins on the phone. Gurgle, gurgle. Hey
Hurricane have you heard this wan. ''Rule Britannia marmalade and jam,
Three Chinese crackers up your backside, bang, bang, bang.'' Picked it
up at Ibrox. Maybe I should have left it. Cheers.

THE most astonishing political switching I can recall was an SNP
councillor who served with me on the old Edinburgh Corporation. Even
before the end of his three-year term he had defected to the Labour
Party, the next time I saw him he was canvassing for the Social
Democrats and, by the last General Election, he was sporting his
original colours again.
''You must have had more parties than Dean Martin,'' I joshed him.
''Maybe,'' he replied, ''but I never got drunk enough to join the
Tories.'' Touche!
Hand on heart, if you had asked me last week who Alan Howarth was, I
might have replied that he was an actor who used to appear on Coronation
Street and, yes, I realise now that his name was Alan Howard.
Mr Howarth, as we all know since the events of the weekend, was once a
Government Minister but if he ever did or said anything profound I must
confess to have missed it.
He will now be forever famous as the man who crossed the floor and
double-crossed his constituents. The Labour Party and he deserve one
another.
I do not deny Mr Howarth the right which is open to us all, to change
our minds about our political allegiance, but I believe the fact that he
is staying on in Parliament to be quite disgraceful.
The people of Stratford-on-Avon voted for a Conservative MP. If Mr
Howarth wants to be something else let him face his constituents again
at the ballot box.
Would it not indeed be the proper course of action for Mr Tony Blair,
he of the muscular Christianity movement, to inform his new recruit that
this would be the honourable route to take? Or does New Labour consider
that this might be a by-election they would fail to win? The trouble
with playing the morality card, Tony, is that folk expect you to abide
by it.
There was a delegate at the Tory conference at Blackpool this week who
told all our Members of Parliament that he expected them ''to keep their
trouser belts buckled and their flies fastened''.
Mr Blair and the Bible thumpers will expect that and daily devotions
from their disciples.
Just as I was last week I found myself greatly underwhelmed this time
by a speech which obviously went down rapturously in the conference
hall.
Mr Michael Portillo excites me not at all though I accept that I may
well be in a minority within the party. There's a change.
Like Mr Blair, his soundbites did not survive the cold light of day.
Whoever said we should have a European Army or that our soldiers would
be required to take orders from Brussels? And, as far as I know, British
servicemen are often given leave to visit their wives after they have
had children. I thought Michael's presentation was poor -- he pouts as
he shouts and moves his mouth in a most curious manner -- and that Brian
Mawhinney made a much more heartening contribution.
The new chairman looks a hard nut as all the good ones in that job,
including Mr Blair's newfound friend, Lord Tebbit, most certainly were.
The most significant statement I have heard so far while watching the
conference did not come from a delegate nor a Government spokesman. It
was uttered by Mr Bob Worcester, head of the Mori polling organisation.
''Europe,'' he insisted, ''is not anywhere near the top of the list
when it comes to deciding how people are going to vote. Unemployment,
law and order, the health service, education -- these are the issues of
most concern.''
And what should worry my party is that they trail in the polls in
every one of them. Brussels bashing may go down a treat with the
activists, it cuts no ice when you are talking to the long-term
unemployed.
I do not expect the Prime Minister tomorrow to sound like an American
evangelist or even like Tony Blair. What I would like him to do is
address the key issues.
Of course I should like to have the burden of tax reduced and I know
only too well, as does any sane or honest person, that Labour will
increase it. But tax cuts alone, or at any price, are not going to swing
around public opinion.
People will need to be convinced that the Conservatives offer less
fear in the future. They have to reduce the fear of losing one's job,
the fear of being burgled or mugged, the fear of falling ill and having
to wait ages to be treated.
And above all, perhaps, the fear of getting old and having to use your
house and life savings to pay for care.
It is all very well for us to say that we have improved this, spent
more on that, cut waiting lists -- just try telling that to someone on
the doorstep or even to Tate and Lyle.
The Labour Party, quite cynically, are promising good times are just
around the corner, John Major needs to deliver them.
Just one of the ways of doing that is to recognise, as Mr Portillo
with all his cheap jingoism fails to, that the world has changed.
Britain cannot stand alone, it needs allies, in defence as much as in
trade. We do not require to sign up for everything in the European
Union, and certainly not for a federal solution, but we sure can't sail
away from it.
And we must recognise, too, that the social fabric of our country has
changed, that families do not all consist of mum, dad, and 2.4 children.
Single mothers also have votes and seeking to blame them for the
country's ills is both cruel and short-sighted.
In short, the Tories have to be seen to care about those less
fortunate than the average. I believe John Major does, in a damned sight
more sincere way than those in the Labour Party who have swallowed every
principle they once held dear. But it is not me he has to convince.

LAST week, you may recall, we made one or two remarks about the cull
of part-time lecturers at Edinburgh's Napier University. En passant, we
mentioned that we were unable to elicit the opinion of victims because
they were forbidden by their employers, champions of academic freedom
one and all, from speaking to the filthy press.
This week an unsigned letter arrives. ''Being in education,'' it
begins, ''I am unable to respond, through the readers' letters, to your
item about college management at Napier''.
The writer then goes on to make several claims about conditions at
Lanarkshire's Bell College of Technology, recalling that earlier this
year the entire teaching staff passed a vote of no confidence in their
management. The vote was ignored by the national papers, so it is
claimed, because the local press, allegedly ''dependent upon advertising
from the college'', would not publish.
Now, given that Bell College was the apparent source of another
anonymous-but-true letter, reported on yesterday's front page and
revealing that principal John Reid is to be paid #92,000 this year while
staff are offered 5% with more strings than Pinocchio, this caught our
eye.
Granted, Mr Reid's ''real'' salary is only #68,000 (up a piddling
#18,000 from last year) topped up by various token payments, mainly to
do with removing the college (slogan: ''Investors in People'') from the
grip of Strathclyde region and rendering it ''autonomous''.
Nevertheless, such is the disparity between this and the treatment of
teaching staff, our correspondent argues, as to suggest that ''NHS
management do not understand emoluments''.
Naturally, we could not possibly comment. But he/she has more to say,
adding: ''Since the college has become independent, it has pursued a
policy of ageism which, if Labour gains power and introduces a
compensation scheme for victims retroactively, will beggar the
college''.
Finally, our correspondent draws our attention to what appear to be
several new courses now available at Bell ''which reflect the new
unitised teaching''.
Thus: ''How to claim qualifications you don't really have!''; ''When,
and where, to bury the hatchet -- and in whom!''; ''Why students should
be given passes!''; ''Hints on passing without study''; and, usefully,
''Copying made simple''.
Advanced students are meanwhile referred to ''Pass me an HNC, or HND
if more convenient!''; ''Obtaining grants in absentia''; ''How to
distance learning from students!''; ''How to ignore external
invigilation''; and, finally, ''Illiteracy -- how to talk your way
out!''
Over, we can only suggest, to the management. Meanwhile, the Diary's
plain brown envelope service for pissed-off pedagogues remains open for
business.
Man for the job
THIS Diary never tires of Malcolm Rifkind. No, truly; can't get enough
of him. It's the splendid creativity of the man, you see, the
willingness to view an argument from every angle, the wonderful
flexibility.
First, as the world knows, he was a sincere devolutionist. Then he
turned against devolution. Next he was a staunch pro-European. Now --
entirely coincidental with the shifting tides of the Tory Party
conference -- he has found much to disparage about a federal Europe.
Federalism is a terrible idea, of course, which is why the Diary is
happy to mark the approaching twentieth anniversary of a ground-breaking
interview given by Mr Rifkind to the old Q magazine (November 1, 1975).
In this he argued, at some length, that devolution for Scotland was an
absolutely essential first step towards -- now what was it? -- ''a
federal constitutional structure for Britain''.
Times change. But with consistency of that order, who else would you
put in charge of your policy for a peaceful, federated Bosnia?
Visionary
FAR be it from us to relate predictable jokes about the death of
astrologer Patric Walker. Instead, a predictable reference to one of the
many obituaries for the great and far-sighted man.
Thus we learn how, ''contemplating retirement'', Walker used ''a
recent trip to Kitzbuhl with numerous friends as a trial run for a
winter base''.
Now that's planning ahead.
Song and dance
SOMETIMES, just sometimes, Scotland's reputation in the world isn't
all it might be. Thus we are in receipt of an article from the
prestigious American publication Trailer Life, a periodical dedicated to
''RV enthusiasts'', otherwise folk fond of the armoured personnel
carriers known as 'recreational vehicles''.
The piece contains a breathless account of a recent visit to the
annual Scottish Highland Gathering and Festival in Costa Mesa,
California, where ''lads and lassies gather on Memorial Day weekend'' to
watch traditional Scottish activities like dancing, singing, and
caber-tossing, not to mention sheepdogs herding sheep and, for some
reason, ducks.
The writer seems much moved by the event, even unto the matchless
culinary delights of Alba. Thus: ''When lunchtime arrived, we indulged
in meat pies, beer and bangers (sausages) for a taste of Old Scotland.
An indoor cafeteria supplemented the ethnic food booths for people who
preferred a sandwich or other conventional American food.''
Ah, the ethnic mutton pies of Old Scotia. But what's a sandwich?
Fish out of water
IN a similar vein we also discover that the noble art of flounder
tramping, as practised at Palnackie on the Urr estuary, has at last been
given the recognition it deserves with comprehensive coverage in the
mighty Sports Illustrated.
The game, a bemused America has learned, ''consists of walking through
mud and catching flounder which feed on crabs and worms by standing on
them''.
Actually, as most of you will know from diaries past, it's not the
flounder who stand on crabs and worms but people who stand on the
flounder.
But let that pass. As it turns out, having waded into the
''surprisingly cold'' mud, our intrepid American friend found the
experience all too much.
Spooked and dooked by the fish, he reports himself as having ''the
feet for flounder tramping but not the stomach''.
Bombed out
CHIRAC has gone too far this time, and Australians aren't taking it
lying down. In response to France's nuclear tests in the South Pacific,
the ''trade association'' of legal prostitutes in Canberra has announced
a boycott of French underwear, hosiery, and cosmetics.
Meanwhile, in another patriotic gesture, Australia's largest chain of
sex shops has taken all French products off its shelves, not least, so
the Diary presumes, those French letters. Further big bangs are
therefore out of the question.

SOMETIMES, a particular theme seems to tap into the collective
theatrical consciousness with such intensity that it appears to dominate
the entire production of a period. The current Zeitgeist, from where I'm
standing, is the theme of captor/captive, being played out on stages
across the country. Well worked though the subject may be, it's one
which has obvious contemporary relevance, besides providing rich
potential for a dramatist.
Noel McMonagle's new play fictionalises the last 30 minutes of the
life of Tanag Jigme Sangpo, a 64-year-old Tibetan imprisoned by the
Chinese for 42 years. The script, despite some clumsiness and rather
heavy-handed symbolism, has a sense of structure which sets out the
shifting balance of power between prisoner and captor with a satisfying
clarity (perhaps, at times, too much clarity) and engaging build-up of
suspense.
Sadly, it receives a production which serves only to amplify its
shortcomings. The direction is pedestrian, with actors moving-by-numbers
from position to position. An over-literal set exemplifies the worst
excesses of theatrical ''scenery'': a textured prison wall with all the
atmosphere of a model railway. But above all, the multi-media format,
intercutting video sequences and on-camera testimonies of Chinese
atrocities with the live action, seems borne more out of a desire to
include trendy technologies than to produce effective theatre. It fails
entirely to consider the problems of integrating live performance and
recorded footage, ultimately diluting the power of both factual and
fictional accounts.

LORD Byron first put swimming to the test of romantic poetry. In 1812
he emulated Leander, the lover of Greek legend, and swam the straits of
the Hellespont. There was no woman on the other side and he didn't mimic
Leander to the extent of drowning. He did catch a cold and write a
famous poem about it.
Today recreational swimmers in Edinburgh will have their chance to
make similar Byronic connections courtesy of the Commonwealth Pool's
Olympic scoreboard which will display the following Ogden Nash gem:
Say not the mermaid is a myth,
I knew one once named Mrs Smith.
She stood while playing cards or knitting:
Mermaids are not equipped for sitting.
It's just one event among hundreds organised for National Poetry Day,
taking place at a time when literature is already creating a uniquely
high British profile for itself via poetry festivals in Manchester,
Birmingham, Cheltenham, Huddersfield and Castlemilk; Scottish Book
Fortnight; Children's Book Week, and the International Storytelling
Festival.
Building on last year's success, Poetry Day is creating a focus for
many literary activities. Performances will range from a massive recital
at the Royal Albert Hall featuring Allen Ginsberg, Sorley MacLean,
Brendan Kennelly and Benjamin Zephaniah, to local readings from St
Helier to Dingwall.
Nationwide events are being co-ordinated by the Poetry Society,
publishers Forward and the BBC. Lines have been open since Saturday for
the Nation's Favourite Poem, the results being broadcast tomorrow by
Griff Rhys Jones. The Internet is carrying volumes of poetry, a global
poetry chain, and the Poetry Map, a Poetry Society network providing
information on all aspects of publishing, reading, reciting and locating
poems and poets.
All this is the combined brain-child of Poetry Society director Chris
Meade and Forward's William Sieghart, evolving from the #16,000 Forward
Poetry Prizes which began in 1992. Their aim? To re-activate the notion
of living poetry.
Chris Meade believes the success of last year's event was due to a
resurgence of British interest in poetry, perhaps in part encouraged by
the reading of a W H Auden poem in Four Weddings and a Funeral. In
Scotland, however, the day will have a benignly propagandist element.
Jenny Brown and Ken Cockburn at Readiscovery are working with a
substantial Arts Council budget to infiltrate the community with words:
poems are being faxed to 100 key Scottish businesses in the way hippies
used to stick flowers down soldiers' gun-barrels.

ONE consequence of the richness and variety of Fotofeis is that, even
without visiting all the exhibitions within it, one makes all manner of
cross- connections between often disparate images, and not just within
the designated themes of migration, mortality and the city.
It also encourages generalisations about the nature of photography, a
medium which has, to an unprecedented extent, endlessly inspired
speculation around its very nature.
It is difficult, therefore, to view Lesley Punton's Where Deer Sleep,
a sequence of immaculate, intimate, repetitive images of areas of grass
showing where deer have slept, without thinking of the photographic
trace itself, hovering between present and absent, time past and
present. And yet the photographs, through their craft, are explicitly to
do with their physical existence at prints; they are by no means
transparent, to be looked through for the subject.
This insistence on the print itself is echoed, in very different ways,
in many of the other shows at Aberdeen Art Gallery. Rory Donaldson has
always worked, in paintingly ways, with the surfaces of his grids of
prints; in Boiling Petroleum, a disappointing installation, he
incorporates computer- generated imagery without fully abandoning his
old concerns, losing the tension between snapshots and objects,
snapshots as images, and snapshots as fragments of a wider culture which
is central to the rest of his work, without developing a fully new
vocabulary.
Ghosts in the Machine, a small but fascinating historical exhibition
of ''spirit prints'', unfolds a Borgesian narrative of evidence and
credulity. These double exposures, so obvious to any modern viewer, were
able to fool even Conan Doyle at least partly because of the status of
the photographic trace as already almost mystically ''real''.
As computer-generated images swallow up this status, it also appears
that the ''realistic'' colours of snapshots, so evocative, with
hindsight, of their particular decades, have now become almost laughably
artificial at the very moment of their development. This is apparent in
the work of the young German photographers in 1 to 6; their photographs
suggest that the subjects of the photographs -- buildings, interiors,
people -- are somehow less real than the universe of images, as a
system, yet each individual image within it is, on examination, itself
unreal and strange. Over exposure becomes a metaphor as well as a
technique.
It is the new blandness of post-modernism, a look between blankness
and irony, suggesting a comparison with Warhol which becomes most
pertinent in Lucinda Devlin's The Omega Suites, a series of photographs
of American execution chambers. As in Warhol, the executions are there
to be imagined rather than seen, but the tabloids are no longer a
legitimate source for such material; the rooms are shown with an
efficiency which matches not just the various instruments of death
themselves, but hotel lobbies. One can imagine them in a brochure,
acting, in another context, as advertisements; would they shock, or
reassure, the ''moral'' majority in America?
Certainly in any images of death or sex, we bring more to the image
than we are given. This year, inevitably, death predominates over
sexuality, although Ann Mendelbaum's small dark prints of human orifices
holding or disgorging organic objects are reworkings, half-morbid,
half-comic, of the formal eroticism of Weston's still lifes (which can
be seen in Edinburgh).
Black Butterfly: Images of Death from Mexico includes, of course,
photographs of The Day of the Dead, but also corpses; dead militants and
bandits (Francisco Mata Rosas and archive photographs), mummified
corpses in living colour (Manuel Zavala) and portraits from the morgue
by Jose Raul Perez, who exhibits his photographs vertically, so that the
dead seem alive. There are many magnificent individual images, not least
by Manuel Alvarez Bravo, but Vida Yovanovich stands out in the
exhibition as a photographer dealing with death not so much as a
continual rhetorical, political and religious presence in Mexican
culture, but as a personal destiny; first through the death of one's
parents, and secondly through one's own death.

* It is widely anticipated that Michael Howard, the Home Secretary,
will today announce a broader role for the security service MI5,
possibly working in tandem with the National Crime Intelligence Service,
to fight major crime. It may foreshadow the day when the NCIS is given
an operational arm, leading to a British FBI.
The prospect of a partnership with MI5, gaining access to security
service resources and equipment, is welcomed by many senior police
officers, but viewed with misgivings by others.
Ian Leigh, senior law lecturer at Newcastle University and co-author
of the definitive book on the security service's relationship with
parliamentary democracy, said: ''There is a feeling arising that the
security service could be more effective than the police because they
are not subject to the same controls as the police. That is precisely
the reason why they should not be involved in ordinary criminal
investigation.''
James Freeman, Home Affairs Correspondent, examines the growing threat
posed by international crime and considers whether the security services
have found a valid new role.
WHILE civil liberty campaigners and some chief constables in England
may harbour misgivings, Michael Howard appears to have be nearer the
mark in the battle against crime with the ambitious plan for a British
FBI. If all the leaks are correct, then freeing up MI5, with its large
resources of cash and expertise, makes more sense than enlisting milkmen
to trap housebreakers or inviting misguided neighbourhood watchers to
''walk with a purpose''.
The areas of international crime most commonly mentioned in connection
with MI5's putative new role are drug trafficking and the attendant
money laundering. It is presumably at the highest end of the scale that
MI5 would enter the fray. Careful leaks in the past week, followed by a
high-profile plea by Stella Rimington, head of MI5, in an English
Speaking Union lecture have apparently paved the way for the Home
Secretary to make the announcement at the Conservative Party Conference
today.
The security service, having lost its lead role against first the
Eastern bloc and then, to some degree, the IRA, as the forces of history
lurch forward, is likely to move into harness with the National Crime
Intelligence Service and, inevitably, with the fraud squads, drug squads
and financial investigation units of the UK police forces, or so the
speculation goes.
As usual, Britain is looking for an example to America, where big-time
crime has become so pervasive that it is said that there is not one
dollar in the pockets of ordinary Americans which has not been laundered
by someone.
The direct threat from drugs criminality and the attendant threat of
corrupting the world-wide financial systems through the handling of
laundered crime money is now openly discussed within the criminal
justice establishment here as the new national menace, now that
communism and Irish terrorism have been seen off.
Some English police chiefs have misgivings; MI5 is, after all, a
direct competitor to their own empires unless it can be tamed and
brought alongside. The major criticism is that the Secret Service is not
publicly accountable and lacks transparency, a charge which has in the
past been levelled at the police service itself.
In their book, In From the Cold, National Security and Parliamentary
Democracy, Laurence Lustgarten and Ian Leigh said that any greater
police openness in recent times has stemmed more from the need to
revitalise public support and co-operation than anything else.
Secondary to that lack of accountability is the allegation that MI5,
operating as it does under the Security Services Act of 1989, can only
deal with such areas as terrorism, subversion and espionage -- matters
which affect national security. But it is true that there is provision
in the Official Secrets Act for MI5 to tackle undefined ''serious
crime'', taken by most authorities to mean international drugs
trafficking and money laundering which can now plainly be seen to
constitute a threat to national economic wellbeing.
The real problem appears to be, according to Lustgarten and Leigh,
that MI5 is not mandated to gather intelligence for the purposes of
criminal proceedings in these fields, because their warrants to carry
out surveillance, whether by bugging or searching, are administrative
and secret with no public element of reference.
When MI5 wishes to bug or telephone tap it obtains a warrant from the
Home Secretary. It is done in secret and, although there is a
commissioner who oversees the process -- currently the English appeal
court judge Lord Justice Stuart-Smith -- the suspect effectively has no
rights. If the police wish to bug or tap in England the warrant must
come from a magistrate, or in some cases a High Court judge, and in
Scotland from a sheriff.
This key issue reinforces the call made by the incoming president of
the Association of Chief Police Officers in England that the security
service should have a supportive role only, running in harness with the
National Crime Intelligence Service. Stretching a point, it might be
possible to justify the MI5 role if it were confined to the gathering of
intelligence alone. The Government is, however, likely to take a wider
interpretation of the law.
At a Scottish level, senior operational police officers to whom The
Herald has spoken have few misgivings about the prospect of MI5 coming
on board. It would be a two-way street, not a takeover, according to
one.
They are very good at analysing complex financial data and have a
clear lead over the police there. If there was ever a need here in
Scotland to look at, say, the involvement of Russian criminals in a drug
smuggling operation -- and given our vast unguarded coastlines that is
not fanciful -- MI5 already possess a knowledge of the language, the
culture and where crime fits into that society, making their involvement
invaluable.
Chief constables will want to see where their own operations can
benefit from MI5 expertise in electronic surveillance.
''We would like to look into their toy cupboard and see if we can use
any of their goodies,'' one very senior Scottish officer said.
''We can learn from MI5. We may be able to tap into them to have our
own men trained.
''There may come a time when there is a major need for financial
skills beyond existing police capability. MI5 would get a new role and
we would also stand to get a boost.''
The most recent public involvement between Scottish forces and MI5 was
over the Sauchie IRA terrorist case, the last major anti-terrorist coup
on British soil prior to the current fragile peace, and officers in both
Strathclyde and Central Scotland forces were openly impressed by MI5.
They were, of course, not police officers, so there were a number of
rough edges to be knocked off.
Stories circulated that the security service men arrived in a fleet of
smart cars with London registrations which had to be changed
immediately, that they came armed with wads of expenses in
high-denomination Bank of England notes and that they were in such
numbers that they would have stuck out like sore thumbs in the Central
Scotland community.
The consensus after they returned to the capital was that they had
made a brilliant contribution.
Detectives here seem to agree with most chief constables that the
''spies'' would be welcome aboard, but in a role which supplements the
existing capabilities of specialist police departments and an NCIS on
which tens of millions has already been spent.
Such an arrangement looks increasingly likely to form the basis of a
future FBI-style force for the UK charged specifically with tackling the
increasingly international business of drugs trafficking and money
laundering. A recent case in Glasgow had an obvious international
dimension with heroin, which probably originated in Pakistan, coming
here via Belgium at the behest of a major London crime organisation.
It will be difficult to argue convincingly against this week's
developments.

On National Poetry Day Gavin Bell joins a postman poet on his rounds
of Kintyre, where inspiration seems to hang in the salty air and the
muse can be encountered on any bend on the road
IT WAS the two heifers blocking a narrow road near Machrihanish that
made Angus Martin stop and think. He was behind schedule with his
morning postal deliveries, and he was irritated by the hold-up. Then he
thought: ''My destination isn't going to move. I'm still going to get
there; just a wee bit later.'' So he sat back in his van and admired the
young cows, and by the time they moved on the outline of a poem was
taking shape in his mind.
A few hours later, Martin sat on a deserted beach watching the grey
Atlantic rollers breaking on the shore. Then he lit a pipe, and wrote a
poem about the absurdity of allowing the demands of the clock to
interfere with the natural rhythms of life. He called it Two Heifers At
Machrihanish.
It often happens like this with Angus Martin, the postman-poet of
Campbeltown. He'll be driving along on his rural rounds, thinking of
nothing in particular, when he'll see or experience something that will
summon his muse.
On another occasion, watching fishermen emptying their lobster creels
inspired an allegorical verse in which a human ends up in a ''keep box''
-- the last resting place of lobsters.
''I find this job very conducive to both thinking and writing
poetry,'' he says. ''As you can see, it's relatively stress-free, and
quite pleasant most of the time.''
We are bumping along a muddy track meandering over the green hills of
south Kintyre, past farms and whitewashed cottages, with flocks of gulls
and rooks wheeling in the fields. Washing lines are snapping in a fresh
breeze, and friendly sheepdogs trot up for a pat as Martin delivers his
letters.
''I can say I'm quite happy doing this job. One of the benefits is
that at the end of the day I can lock up the van and go home, and forget
my work till the morning. That keeps my head clear for my own
thoughts,'' he says.
It is just as well for Martin that he enjoys his ''day job'', because
he would be hard-pressed to support his family on his income from
writing poetry. Although well regarded in the writing fraternity, and
lauded by the Scottish Arts Council, there is limited public demand for
his verse. His last royalty cheque, from a collection of poems, was for
#2. He has had five other books published, on social history and the
fishing industry, but they have not made much money either.
He accepts this state of affairs philosophically: ''Obviously, poetry
doesn't have a wide popular appeal, and I don't see how that can ever
change much. It will probably remain a minority interest. That's just
the way it is.''
In any case, Martin is happier driving his red post van around Kintyre
six days a week than he would be locked away in an ivory tower with his
muse. ''I don't think I could just write poetry. It could be done, of
course. You could shut yourself away and just write, but I prefer
society. I think it's more sensible to keep active in the world, and to
move around people.''
It is still hard to make ends meet on his salary, with three young
daughters to bring up, and he is deeply grateful to the Scottish Arts
Council for its support. A bursary awarded this year, designed to give
him more time to write, was very welcome. ''In a sense, I don't approve
of hand-outs,'' he says. ''If you're a writer you'll write, even if all
you have is a candle and a stub of pencil. But there are times when a
financial lift is necessary, and that's where the Arts Council does
really good work.''
Martin's job helps him in other ways. Working in a traditional, rural
community he hears old Scots expressions which are peculiar to the area,
or which have died out in other parts of the country; he collects such
words and phrases for the Scottish National Dictionary project in
Edinburgh, and incorporates many of them in his poetry, which is
increasingly influenced by Scots idioms.
But most of all it is being in the open air, and having time to
reflect on nature and history, that inspires and breathes life into his
poetry. He recently stumbled across a small, bronze-age site while
hill-walking, and four poems came from the discovery. At Ballygregan
Farm, an old, grey place on a hill, he says: ''There was an ancestor of
mine, Colin McGuiness, who lived here a couple of hundred years ago.''
He says it as if it was yesterday.
Before joining the Post Office 16 years ago, Martin was a herring
fisherman and his ties to the sea remain strong. Weather permitting, his
favourite spot for contemplation and composition is a remote beach where
his only company is gulls and sometimes starlings flitting above the
flying spray.
He will not be participating in any of today's National Poetry Day
events, partly because he has not been invited to do anything and partly
because he is reluctant to organise anything himself. He is a
soft-spoken, modest man who does not impose himself on the community he
lives in. ''I usually do only one reading a year. There's only so much
you can do in a small place like this.''
He has not cultivated a wider audience because he is happy where he
is, and he dislikes travelling. Family holidays are spent a few miles
away in a caravan at Southend. He has never driven on a motorway, and
doubts if he ever will. A forthcoming jaunt to Edinburgh, to take his
daughters to the zoo and the National Museum, will be undertaken by bus
and train.
So while other poets are rushing around today on reading tours, Angus
Martin will be driving his van at its usual sedate pace through the
Kintyre countryside, with a notebook in his pocket and his thoughts
drifting towards the birds and the animals around him.
This suits him fine -- he can live without fame and fortune, and he's
not sure he deserves them anyway. ''I don't rate myself particularly
highly as a poet,'' he says. ''I've some merit, no doubt, but if I was
using a football analogy I wouldn't put myself in the premier league.
I'd be somewhere near the bottom of the first division, I think.'' He
pauses reflectively, then says: ''But then, the potential's aye there,
isn't it?''
At the other end of the country, on the Isle of Lewis, another poet
has taken the bold step of resigning from a secure job to devote himself
to full-time writing.
Ian Stephen, a coastguard at Stornoway for 10 years, made the move
this year after winning a literary award and being granted a Scottish
Arts Council bursary. His prize in the inaugural Robert Louis Stevenson
award, sponsored by the international distribution company Christian
Salvesen, was two months in a French village frequented by Stevenson and
other writers and artists in the 1870s. The outcome was a new collection
of poems which will be published soon.
Free for the first time to concentrate on his writing, Stephen
developed a systematic approach in France which he was loath to
surrender on his return to Lewis. After discussing the options with his
wife, who has a part-time job in the voluntary sector, he decided to
make the break from HM Coastguards.
''It wasn't an easy decision to make, especially since I liked my job
and it was secure and reasonably well paid,'' he recalls. ''We knew we
would take a drop in earnings, but in the end we decided it would be
worth it in terms of having a more balanced life. The award and the
bursary made it a lot easier, of course, and now we're quite happy with
the move.''
Like his kindred spirit in Kintyre, Ian Stephen has been strongly
influenced by his ''day job'' -- seafaring themes pervade much of his
writing, and maritime rescue operations, in particular, have produced
several short stories. Of one of his poetry collections, a Herald
reviewer wrote: ''His main subjects -- seas, winds and tides, shorelines
and horizons -- are expressed in precisely observed details of shape,
colour, texture and movement that capture the spirit of a place as well
as the topography.''
Stephen says: ''The coastguard job was very good for subject matter.
It gave me a lot in terms of experience and contact with the rest of the
world, but writing had to take second place, which was frustrating. I'm
much happier now.''
Finances are tight, with two young sons to support, but Ian Stephen
manages to keep his family above the fiscal Plimsoll line with freelance
journalism and occasional poetry readings on radio and television. He
will not be featuring in any events today, however.
He is busy completing his new collection of poetry, working on a
novel, and preparing to return to France to give a series of readings
and workshops at international schools. It seems likely that Robert
Louis Stevenson would approve.

SOMETIMES you see a performance that is just frightening. In Perth
Theatre's touring production of Alexander Gelman's A Man With
Connections, originally directed by Russia's Vadim Radun, now re-staged
by Perth assistant director Dominic Hill, you see two of them.
I mean performances that alarm you by their capacity to expose the raw
nerve ends of a character; performances that dig deep into their
emotional life and then dig, twist, and wrench some more.
Thus it is with Kenneth Bryans and Irene Macdougall in this long,
demanding, utterly compelling and thoroughly rewarding two-hander that
has the relentless, bludgeoning force of a prime-time boxing fixture.
Gelman's script is a kind of Russian All My Sons, except the motive is
not the war but the ruthless command of the Soviet Plan. At stake is the
guilt or innocence of a father over an industrial accident that has left
his son without hands. Under scrutiny is both the microcosm of Russian
family life, painstakingly dissected and torn apart, and the macrocosm
of a whole economic system that is supported by a society dulled into
apathy by institutionalised corruption.
It's some weight for Bryans and Macdougall to carry but, in
performances that are among the best you will ever see, they carry it
with virtuosity. The production resounds with the shock of hearing
innocuous marital chatter switch in a sentence to penetrating argument,
of watching doting domestic details -- Bryans feeding Macdougall like a
two-year-old, Macdougall calmly stopping the conversation to fill a
glass of water -- turn in a moment to vicious emotional attacks.
I remember thinking A Man With Connections was good when it first
played at the Traverse several years ago. This production makes it
stunning.

HOW appropriate that Janis Ian should be most famous for a song called
At Seventeen because, even at fortysomething, there's still a
youthfulness in her voice.
At times that quality becomes almost childlike, coy, naive even,
although there's nothing childlike or naive about Ride Me Like A Wave, a
song that has nothing to do with surfing.
As her set progresses through the smouldering This Train Still Runs,
the swinging, up-tempo Fly Too High and the sultry Ready For The War, it
becomes clear that Ian sings (and sings very well) to keep from talking.
Her spiel about an unsuccessful approach to John Lewis for sponsorship
is exhausting. Later, she recounts her grandma's advice to the
successful young singer: buy a coat.
I don't know about the coat but she certainly hired a good band: a
bass guitarist who sounded like he could do the gig by himself; a
stylish, selfless drummer; and a keyboards player who also put in
sterling service as backing singer, alto saxophonist, harmonica player,
flautist, jaw harpist, accordionist, and mike stand engineer.
Ian holds her own in the chops department on her dinky guitar. But
it's her multi-faceted talents as singer and songwriter that stand out.
Her lyrics are sharply poetic and her melodic progressions well
developed.
When At Seventeen arrives, at about the halfway point, she launches
into a mocking, throwaway version of Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head
instead, although her own finely honed tune and the quartet's sensitive
playing sound tailor-made for a classic Stan Getz tenor solo.

MOSCOW: Soviet secret police killed over 100 prisoners by testing
poisons intended to kill without trace for spy missions, according to
recently disclosed KGB files, it was reported yesterday. Josef Stalin's
top henchman, Lavrenty Beria, authorised the tests after his poison
experts said they could not be sure the toxic agents they had tested on
animals would kill humans, the Russian newspaper Kuranty reported.

<HEADLINE>A defensive role as Kingsley has his fun</HEADLINE>

PHIL PENFOLD talks to Ben Kingsley about a box-office success lacking
in gravitas
LET'S get straight to the point. How does Ben Kingsley sum himself up?
The Oscar-winning actor takes a deep breath and thinks for a second.
''More of a Harlequin than a Hamlet,'' he says. And then he breaks into
a huge grin and says: ''Boy! Now that's a good quote. In a few years'
time people will be pulling that one from the cuttings libraries and
saying it back to me. And . . . (another huge grin) I shall deny it
completely!''
Kingsley got his Academy Award for his portrayal of Gandhi. And
another nomination for his playing of the crooked lawyer Meyer Lansky in
Bugsy. It is doubtful if he'll get very much at all from his involvement
with Species, a sci-fi thriller which has cleared up at the US box
office and which looks set to repeat the performance over here.
''It is, pure and simple, entertainment,'' he admits. ''Nothing more
and nothing less. Remember, please, that I am not a serious actor.
Really. I joined this business to be an entertainer. I wanted, truly, to
be a song-and-dance, tell-a-few-gags man. Somehow or other I seemed to
get into the striaght theatre, and that's where I've stayed.
''People -- especially in America -- come up to me in reverential
tones and say 'Mr Kingsley, it is an honour to meet you'. I genuinely
cannot understand why. They should be honoured to meet Gandhi, or Itzhak
Stern from Schindler's List. They're the characters I play. Not me.''
As far as stage heroes went, ''when I was a kid, the people that I
revered were Tommy Cooper, Frankie Howerd, Tony Hancock. People that
made me -- and the nation -- laugh. I liked Buster Keaton, because he
had . . . pathos.''
After eight years away, filming all around the world, but chiefly in
Los Angeles, Kingsley is coming home,back to a house near
Stratford-on-Avon ''that I don't see half as much as I'd like to,'' and
''an apartment in London.''
The reason is, he says, is that ''my dear friend and mentor, Trevor
Nunn, has asked me to play Feste in his film of Twelfth Night. Trevor
was the director who first encouraged me and seemed to believe in me,
and he's lined a terrific cast up for the movie version. It includes
Nigel Hawthorne, Richard E Grant, Helena Bonham-Carter.
''I'm going to make Feste very dry, very acid. A bit like Robin
Williams. As a film, it might be the stepping stone which will encourage
me back into the theatre. We shall see what happens. It was Trevor, you
know, who asked me to play Ford in The Merry Wives of Windsor all those
many years ago, and it was a time when I think I really felt happiest.''
Despite a fairly full defence of Species, it's clear that, as far as
Kingsley's career goes, it was and is nothing but a convenient
pot-boiler. As he himself puts it: ''Schindler's List will still be a
remarkable movie in 20, 30, 40 years time. Species will be a good old
sci-fi film.''
There are critics who might disagree with him. He says: ''If we look
back in 20 years, will we find the science-fiction of today as funny as
we now find Flash Gordon? I rather think that we will. The frames of
reference will all have changed.
''I think that today we make the mistake of thinking that all alien
lifeforms will be in some way like us. Arms, legs, heads . . . I think
that there is another intelligence out there, maybe several. But they
could be a gas, or a magnetic field. Who's to tell?''
Yes, he says, ''Schindler's List was exhausting to make. A moving and
stimulating experience for all of us. One cannot help but have days when
you're doing something like that, or the more recent Death and the
Maiden, when it does not profoundly affect the way that the actor
behaves.
''Yes, it is true that I did get very angry when a German actor
started pushing a Polish extra around on Schindler's List. VERY angry
indeed. There is absolutely no excuse for bullying.''
He says: ''As an actor's tool, we all have a subtext. It's to make it
enjoyable for us actors. But it has to remain a secret to everyone else.
And a wellspring of emotion is a must in a film with lots of special
effects, like Species. That is the anchor.
''Acting is being, well, like in the playground at school. When you're
a kid, you can imagine anything you want to. If you want a monster
dashing at you, think hard enough and there it is! Actors just keep on
doing that after everyone else has grown up.''
Death and the Maiden got a lot of praise, but not a lot of attention
at the box office. ''I know, and that was sad. Because I think we made a
good picture. Now you're going to say that the man I played was a
monster, aren't you? How do you know? You have to put a spin of
ambiguity on someone like that, otherwise they just get boring.
Predictable.
''I keep on mining and mining, digging into the deeper sides of my
psyche.''
This is the man who admits: ''I got a lot of laughs in Hamlet,'' and
who speedily qualifies that: ''I thought he was a very bright, witty
kind of a guy, the sort of person that people want to be around. And the
tragedy is that he goes mad.''
He does not want to go the route of the ''English actor who is hired
by Hollywood to play the baddie all the time. I've definitely resisted
that. So far. All I want to do is play interesting people who have that
something different about them.
''As for Xavier Fitch in Species, he may be sinister, he may be the
villain, but he's also a man who loses the child he's created. Now that
makes him interesting for me.''
Often mistaken for fellow ex-RSC member Patrick Stewart (''fans are
always telling me how much they enjoy Star Trek and I smile and sweetly
say my humble thanks'') he says that if there is alien life out there,
he would like to send a message.
What? ''It would be 'Help!' '' he adds. So let's try asking him again
how he really views himself. ''I am just a bloke. I like to tell
jokes.''

YOU live and learn, don't you? Last night I learnt many things I
hadn't hitherto known about Paul Simon's ex-partner. From Art's own
lips, I learnt that he once lived in Oban, and that he can be
self-mocking about his less-than-luxuriant locks.
I learnt that esteemed songwriter Jim Webb is presently Art's tennis
partner. I learnt that, as a form of recreation unfathomable even to
him, Art has been walking across the United States in instalments,
having so far covered 3000 miles from his apartment in New York to
Seattle, Washington.
What else did I learn? I learnt, contrary to expectation, that Art
Garfunkel has an affectingly wan and unadorned voice for such songs of
Paul Simon's that most require it. Folk-rooted songs with four-square
tunes and plain words conveying intellectual depths which need no
histrionic elaboration.
Conversationally sardonic songs like Mrs Robinson. Songs with an
acutely-captured social realism at their core. Sound of Silence is one
such. If only Art hadn't tried to over-act his way through it last
night.
His sepulchral breathiness did work a treat on Sam Cooke's Wonderful
World, though, but merely conferred blandness on untutored songs
demanding a sense of emotional engagement, like I'll Do My Crying In the
Rain and I Only Have Eyes For You.
Anything else? From my vantage point behind the lighting-man, reading
his song-notes over his shoulder, I saw April Comes She Will identified
by the words ''Git starts''. This didn't refer to Art, who came in later
-- after his g(u)itarist -- and jolly pleasantly he did it. This I
learnt, too.

KIEV: A man angered over a recent break-up with his girlfriend bit off
her nose and swallowed it, a Ukrainian newspaper reported. The attack
came after the couple began dividing up their possessions in the village
of Zburyevka, the newspaper reported. It said the man lunged at the
44-year-old woman, bit off her nose, and ate it. Doctors sewed a new
nose on the woman, using skin and muscle tissue from her arm.

MOGADISHU: At least 15 people were killed and 29 wounded in fighting
between forces loyal to warlord Mohamed Farah Aideed and local Lisan
sub-clan militiamen in the Somalian city of Baidoa yesterday, witnesses
said. The witnesses, in a group of wounded people evacuated to
Mogadishu, said over 100 families fled the fighting which came shortly
after Somali faction leader Osman Hassan Ali Atto said his forces had
captured Balidogle airport, southwest of Mogadishu, from Aideed forces.

THE Court of Appeal yesterday reserved its judgment on whether the
blanket ban on homosexuals serving in Britain's armed forces is legal.
Three judges decided to take time to consider their decision in a
historic test case challenge brought by four former service personnel
discharged under the Ministry of Defence policy.
In his final submissions during a three-day hearing, Mr David Pannick
QC, appearing for three of the sacked applicants, asked the judges to
rule that the ban ''is simply an abuse of power which is unreasonable in
a civilised society''.
Earlier, the QC rejected assertions by military chiefs that their
absolute policy of dismissing homosexuals and lesbians was justified
because of the risk that they could undermine the morale and
effectiveness of fighting units.
Mr Pannick said there was no evidence to support those fears but a
''mountain'' of evidence to show they were groundless.
He described how an openly gay Dutch sailor was allowed to share
accommodation on a Royal Navy vessel and gay officers from other
Commonwealth countries had taken part in exchange visits without causing
problems.
Most of Britain's Nato and Commonwealth allies did not feel the need
for such a blanket ban.
The appeal -- brought by ex-RAF nurse Jeanette Smith, 28, of
Edinburgh, and three men -- is against a High Court ruling in June that
the MoD ban was lawful, although one of the judges, Lord Justice Simon
Brown, said he thought the policy was doomed as ''the tide of history''
was against the MoD.
The appeal judges did not indicate when they would give their ruling
but it is expected within weeks.
Later, the judges heard an application by Navy radio operator Robbie
MacGillivray, 23, who was also dismissed because he was homosexual.
Mr MacGillivray, of Finchley, north London, was seeking leave to
challenge his sacking after his case was rejected by a High Court judge.
0 The Master of the Rolls said the court would give its decision when
it ruled in the other four cases.

Harare
A BRITISH solicitor was still dangerously ill in hospital in Zimbabwe
today after a safari tragedy in which she was gored and trampled by an
elephant.
Caroline Suckley, 30, is in the intensive care unit of the Avenue's
Clinic in the capital, Harare.
She was attacked by a female elephant as she took photographs of the
herds in the Manapools Game Park 300 miles from Harare.
Her mother Mary and father John were flying to Zimbabwe from their
farm at Nesscliff, Shropshire, today to be with their daughter.
Mrs Suckley refused to discuss her daughter's case. ''We are extremely
upset, of course, and we have nothing to say at present,'' she said.
The elephant attack happened on Saturday when Miss Suckley and her
28-year-old sister, Elizabeth, were touring the reserve on a truck with
guides.
Caroline left the vehicle to take photographs and the female charged,
goring her with its tusks and then trampling her.
She broke six ribs, her pelvis and suffered a collapsed lung. Guides
fired shots in the air to scare the maddened animal away.
The injured woman was flown to hospital in Harare for emergency
treatment.
Zimbabwe is in the grip of a severe drought which has caused water
shortages. Animals have to travel further for scarce water and become
bad tempered and dangerous.
* A woman fishing illegally in South Africa's Kruger Park game reserve
has been killed by a crocodile, national parks officials said today.
A statement said that the woman was waist deep in a river fishing with
a net when the crocodile attacked on Saturday. She died of her injuries
on Monday.--PA/Reuter.

Going round the bend: Pocahontas may get her man, but the
charaterisation is a shallow realisation of an infinitely more subtle
story.
William Russell takes issue with depictions of historical events which
fail their subjects
MORE bad history on the screen this week, so, having complained about
Braveheart, and been taken to task by several irate patriots, I don't
want to be accused of double standards by not facing up to the problem
Ken Loach's Land and Freedom and Disney's Pocahontas present.
There is always the excuse that innacuracy does not matter because
this is only a film, only entertainment. Tell that to Richard III. The
argument advanced by one enraged patriot that Braveheart might have been
wrong, but did bring a national hero to the attention of young Scots,
says little for history teaching in our schools.
Historians, notoriously partial, cannot be taken as gospel, but once
that is understood some approximation to truth can be discerned.
Disney's latest cartoon operetta, Pocahontas, purports to tell the story
of ''a truly remarkable Native American heroine''.
In 1607 British settlers led by greedy Governor Ratcliffe, there for
the gold, arrive in Virginia. Among their number is strapping Aryan,
John Smith, who does not join in the gold frenzy but goes for a walk in
the woods where he meets Pocahontas, daughter of Chief Powhatan, who has
told us in song that she is looking for something ''just around the
river bend''.
That something is John. The Native Americans and the Settlers go to
war, John is captured, wounded, and sentenced to death by Powhatan, but
Pocahontas persuades everyone to see sense and that is about that. John
sails back to England to recuperate and Pocahontas keeps going round
that bend.
This bears no relation to her infinitely more interesting real-life
story, and even as a cartoon the film is a sad comedown for Disney. The
animation is crude, the visuals vulgar, and the fact it is about humans,
always Disney's weakest feature, does not help. There are too few
animals, although Meeko, the racoon, Flit the hummingbird, and Percy,
the Governor's pug, are amusing.
Pocahontas, sung by Judy Kuhn, looks like something out of Baywatch,
as does Smith, spoken and sung by Mel Gibson and Alan Menken's score is
unmemorable. It is only entertainment, but it denies both the Native
Americans and the descendants of the Settlers their real past, which is
wrong, and it is not even good entertainment.
Loach's film is not bad history, but it is selective history. Anyone
assuming Land and Freedom summed up the entire Spanish Civil war would
be wrong. It is this partiality which has upset many people on other
parts of the left.
Written by Jim Allen, it tells how a young unemployed Liverpool man,
David (well played by Ian Hart), inspired by the struggle against
fascism in Spain, goes off to join the fight and falls in with POUM, a
Marxist splinter group based round Barcelona at odds with the Stalinist
communists. Herein lies the problem.
Loach argues that the revolution was betrayed by the Stalinists, POUM
destroyed by the comrades, a view which is not shared by many veterans
of the war who consider POUM to have been an irrelevance. Right or
wrong, you at least know where Loach stands, which is somewhere
alongside Orwell's Homage to Catalonia, and that allows one, while being
engaged by the narrative, to view it in context.
He has told David's story with great economy and never glorifies war,
showing it as a haphazard affair in which death comes unexpectedly. The
film is among his best work for the cinema, a triumph.
Roger Donaldson's Species, a science-fiction tale about an alien
looking for sex, is great fun. Ben Kingsley plays an unscrupulous
scientist in charge of a remote laboratory in Utah who loses his alien,
Sil (Natasha Henstridge), a curvacious blonde, who, at moments of
stress, reverts to her alien form which is very nasty indeed.
On the run in California, she uses her human shape to entice men. She
wants to get pregnant, give birth to lots of little aliens, and thus
take over the world.
Ms Henstridge, pursued by the usual ragbag of scientists led by
Michael Madsen, Forest Whitaker, and Alfred Molina, takes her clothes
off at regular intervals, which helps pass the time agreeably, and
Molina gets to die with a smile on his face after she has had her wicked
way with him. Although a potpourri of bits from every alien movie there
ever was, everyone knows this and acts accordingly.
Will Sil's offspring take over the world? Have they done so already?
Judging by Mortal Kombat, the latest computer game-inspired fantasy
film, they have.
The usual martial-arts antics explode on screen as evil sorcerer Shang
Tsung stages a contest to the death between his four armed Plasticine
monsters and a trio of super-heroes who fight for Rayden, good God of
Thunder (Christopher Lambert in a white shoulder-length wig looking like
Betty Grable).
The fights are fine, although the monster is a bit stodgy. An attempt
has been made to inject some humour into the goings on, but because the
cast are all graduates of the speak-your-weight school of acting who
could not tell a joke to save their lives, it fails.
This is a pointless film. People who play the game, now into its third
manifestation, will get more fun out of playing it than from watching
this old load of computer-generated tosh. Those who don't won't go.
The new term has begun at Columbus University and the students are a
right old ethnic mixture who seem to loathe one another and swiftly fall
into tight little groups. What we are seeing in Higher Learning is, of
course, a microcosm of present-day America in which blacks and whites
squabble, a girl is date-raped, Nazi racists ferment trouble, a weak
chap from the sticks shaves his head and takes to the rooftops with a
gun, a black boy on a sports scholarship cannot see why he must also
study, and the Hispanics lounge around idling, while the one teacher in
view, a noble negro (Laurence Fishburne) delivers homilies to his flock
to which they pay no attention.
Directed by John Singleton, who made Boyz in the Hood, it is a mess,
but one has to respect an ambitious attempt to look at multicultural
intolerance in American society. It ends in bloodshed and with the hint
of some kind of understanding having been forged between black and
white. Singleton has failed, but at least he aspired.

A SCOTTISH Office move to curb the serious problems caused in many
areas by ''families from hell'', by preventing them from buying their
houses when in the process of being evicted, yesterday received a mixed
reaction.
Councillor Mary Mulligan, Edinburgh District Council's housing
convener, said the council favoured the move as it had experienced
problems with the anti-social activities of some tenants buying their
property.
''We have had no way of stopping these purchases going through and we
are beaten once they do.''
Mr David Comley, director of housing at Glasgow District Council, said
the principle was very welcome but he would like to see how it would
work in practice, the key being at what stage the right to buy
prohibition would apply.
However, Councillor Teresa McNally, Cosla's housing vice-convener,
said it was potentially an extremely superficial solution to what was a
much more deep-seated problem, affecting not only public-sector tenants
but families and households ''across all tenures in Scotland''.
''This may have been motivated by soundbite rather than sound sense,''
she stated.
In his announcement, Mr Forsyth said anti-social tenants could cause
''untold misery and distress'' to neighbours.
''They should not have the right to buy when their landlord is trying
to evict them for anti-social behaviour.''
At present, tenants can exercise their statutory right to buy at any
time up until they are evicted.

Washington
JOHN Wayne Bobbitt wants to get back together with his estranged wife,
who wounded more thanhis pride.
With flowers and chocolates, Bobbitt made a bid for reconciliation
with Lorena at the hair salon where she works, but she turned him away,
twice, The Washington Post reported today.
''He came over here, and then he came back. Can you imagine the
nerve?'' the Post quoted one of Mrs Bobbit's co-workers as saying in
Arlington, Virginia.
An off-duty police officer ended up escorting her to her car when she
left work, the newspaper said.
In 1993, Mrs Bobbitt cut off her husband's penis, saying he had raped
and emotionally tortured her. A jury found her not guilty of malicious
wounding by reason of temporary insanity.
She spent several weeks in a mental institution, and has been working
at the hairdressing salon since last February.
Bobbitt was acquitted of sexually assaulting his wife in a separate
trial.
The couple are in the process of getting a divorce.
Doctors surgically reattached Bobbitt's penis.
Since then he has made an X-rated video, John Wayne Bobbitt . . .
Uncut, and has been on a promotional tour of sex clubs and
nightspots.--AP.

Stockholm
AMERICAN scientists, backed by some of the world's finest educational
institutions, have once again swept the lion's share of Nobel prizes for
science this year.
Of nine winners who shared the four 1995 scientific prizes this week,
six were from the United States, continuing a pattern that has developed
in recent years. Another winner, Mexican Mario Molina, works in
Massachusetts.
Such is the American domination of the scientific prizes that the
major US research universities sometime appear to be slugging it out for
honours.
Scientists from the University of California, Massachusetts Institute
of Technology (MIT) and the University of Chicago have dominated this
year's awards. Three of today's five winners are employed at Californian
universities.
Swedish Nobel Academy scientists who award the prize say the reason is
simple: American scientists are the best taught, the best equipped and
the best paid.
Today the Nobel Physics and Chemistry prizes were announced. In the
field of chemistry, three men were honoured who have been responsible
for spearheading the fight to alert the world to the dangers of the
ozone holes in the atmosphere.
An international team of Dutchman Paul Crutzen, Molina of Mexico and
American F Sherwood Rowland will share the #630,000 prize for their work
on the ozone layer.
''Thanks to our good scientific understanding of the ozone problem --
and very largely to Crutzen, Molina and Rowland -- it has been possible
to make far-reaching decisions on prohibiting the release of gases that
destroy ozone,'' said the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.
Molina and Rowland published a now-famous article in 1974 in the
scientific journal Nature which revealed a threat to the ozone layer
from CFC gases.
''Great news, what a surprise,'' Molina told the Swedish news agency
TT half-an-hour after the announcement, adding he was delighted the
three old friends were sharing the prize.
Earlier, two more Americans, Martin Perl of Stanford University in
California and Frederick Reines of the University of California were
awarded the physics prize for their discoveries of two of natures'
smallest sub-atomic particles.
The academy said Perl won for his discovery of the Tau Lepton and
Reines' confirmation of the existence of a ''frightful thing'' -- a
particle that could never be discovered.
Swedish academy members, who once a year must explain the complex
scientific prizes to lay journalists, said the particles support the Big
Bang theory of creation and may make communication between galaxies
possible one day.
One of the particles, the neutrino, may some day be used for
communication because it is able to travel long distances without being
affected by its environment.
''The neutrino is the only particle that can allow us to communicate
over long distances, meaning to foreign galaxies,'' academy member Per
Carlson told Reuters.
Frederick Reines was the first scientist to detect the fleeting
neutrino, one sub-atomic particle, whose existence was once thought
impossible to prove.
Perl said he tried to ignore a ringing telephone but was surprised
when the caller announced the news he would be sharing $1m with Reines.
Perl, 68, received the news of his selection from a reporter who
tracked him down in his San Francisco home.
''I'm very pleased,'' Perl said of the prize. ''I'm pleased for my
colleagues. I'm pleased for SLAC (Stanford Linear Accelerator Center),
for Stanford and for the Department of Energy.
''As you know, funding for this kind of research is less than it used
to be,'' he said. ''I hope this will help DOE (Department of Energy)
maintain its funding for basic research.''--Reuter.

Paris
FRENCH Prime Minister Alain Juppe escaped prosecution today over his
personal housing lease but a public prosecutor said he had broken the
law on conflict of interest and ordered him to move house.
The decision by Paris prosecutor Bruno Cotte spared Juppe from
resignation but caused him fresh political embarrassment at a time when
his popularity has crashed and he is under fire from public sector trade
unions demanding a pay rise.
In a report to the Justice Ministry, Cotte said the case against Juppe
should be closed on condition that he gave a written undertaking to move
out of his low-rent, City of Paris-owned apartment by the end of this
year.
The prime minister said last week he planned to move soon.
Cotte said Juppe appeared to have committed an offence by leasing the
elegant 2024 sq ft Left Bank flat from the city in 1990 while he was
assistant mayor for finance in charge of supervising rents, including
his own.
''It appears the elements constituting the obtaining and maintenance
of an illegal interest are sufficiently established so that . . . the
penal responsibility of Mr Alain Juppe is involved,'' the prosecutor
said in a statement.
However, he used his power under the code of penal procedure to drop
proceedings on condition that Juppe move out.
''Mr Alain Juppe has been notified by letter asking him, as he
promised on October 6, 1995, to put an end to this interest by leaving
the premises in Rue Jacob before the end of 1995 and confirming in
writing he has met this condition,'' it said.
If Cotte had demanded a full judicial investigation, Juppe would have
been forced to resign under government policy.
Wounded but not felled, the prime minister made no comment on the
decision and sat stony-faced through parliamentary question time without
taking any questions himself.
Juppe's legal problems had weakened the French franc, so news that he
would not have to resign sent the currency jumping to 3.4850 against the
German mark after falling to 3.51 earlier on market rumours that he had
quit or even been arrested.
French bonds and stocks also recovered.
Arnaud Montebourg, lawyer for a Paris taxpayers' association which
brought the case against Juppe, said the decision showed France had one
law for the powerful and another for the poor, and that its government
was run by ''a delinquent''.

<HEADLINE>Howard not guilty in IRA rights case</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>975929700</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
HOME Secretary Michael Howard was cleared by the High Court yesterday
of accusations that he unlawfully denied IRA prisoners the right to
proper contact with their families and lawyers.
Two judges, Lord Justice Rose and Mr Justice Wright, rejected
accusations that Mr Howard acted outside his powers by directing that
convicted terrorists in an ''exceptionally high escape risk'' category
could receive only ''closed visits''.
Michael O'Brien, serving 18 years for attempted murder, and Liam
O'Duibhuir, jailed for 30 years for conspiracy to cause explosions, had
claimed the policy amounted to a fundamental breach of human rights.
However, the judges said ''closed visit'' arrangements in their cases
could not be described as ''other than reasonable''.
They refused leave to appeal. Lord Justice Rose said: ''If you can
excite the interest of the Court of Appeal then so be it.''
Mr Howard ordered a jail security clampdown after the attempted armed
IRA breakout from Whitemoor prison, Cambridgeshire, in September last
year.
The new arrangements for exceptionally high-risk Category A prisoners
(there are 13 in top-security jails) mean they have no physical contact
with visitors and are separated by glass screens during meetings.
O'Dhuibhir is being held at Belmarsh prison in south London and
O'Brien is at Whitemoor.
O'Dhuibhir took part in the Whitemoor incident and now faces a charge
of breaking out of prison and possession of a firearm with intent to
endanger life.
O'Brien was not involved in the breakout but is applying to the House
of Lords for permission to appeal over his original conviction in March
1993.

THE first episode of a new series of police thriller Cracker is being
moved to avoid a clash with News at Ten, ITV said yesterday.
ITV had planned to put the news back 15 minutes for the start of the
new series next Monday, but this incurred the wrath of TV watchdogs.
ITV said yesterday the first episode would now be shown on Sunday,
October 22 -- when there is no News at Ten. A rerun of a previous
episode of the award-winning Cracker, starring Robbie Coltrane, will be
screened at 9pm on Monday, October 16.
The remaining episodes of the three-part story, Brotherly Love, will
follow on October 23 and 30.
The original decision to put back News at Ten had angered the
Independent Television Commission. It claimed it was not consulted about
the change, which allegedly infringes the terms of ITV licences.
Under the licences, ITV companies must broadcast 30 minutes of
national and international news in peak time -- between 6pm and 10.30pm.
The timing of News at Ten has been a sensitive issue since a row
erupted two years ago when ITV tried to move the news to make way for
uninterrupted blockbuster movies.

FOR young Davida Shelton, the George Medal will be a poignant reminder
of the brave father she never knew.
She marked her second birthday yesterday by meeting the Queen and
collecting Britain's highest peace time bravery award inscribed with her
father's name.
Mr David Shelton -- Davida was named in his memory -- was killed
trying to save his workmates in a pit disaster at Bilsthorpe Colliery,
Nottinghamshire, in August 1993, seven weeks before his daughter was
born.
Mrs Sonja Shelton, 22, from Worksop, Nottinghamshire, and daughters
Davida and Melodie, three, collected the posthumous award at a private
audience with the Queen before a Buckingham Palace investiture.
Miners Peter Alcock, 50, and Bill McCulloch, 26, died with Mr Shelton,
31, an under manager at the mine.
Six escaped, including Mr Ray Thompson, 47, who was also awarded the
George Medal.
Mr Shelton died when 9000 tonnes of rock collapsed in a pit roof fall.
He chose not to escape from the collapsing roof and remained to warn
other miners. He was directly beneath the area of roof which fell.
Initially, it dropped by more than half a metre and miners working
with Mr Shelton started to run towards the mine shaft to safety.
As they did, one grabbed Mr Shelton to drag him with them but he chose
to stay to warn the others.
Seconds later, the roof fell in, completely burying him.
Mrs Shelton said: ''No award can ease the pain suffered by all the
families affected by the accident and no award can erase the memory of
the tragedy.
''David did not work in the coal industry to win awards -- he was a
miner because he loved his work, enjoyed the challenge, and treasured
the comradeship of his colleagues.
''He did what many other men would have done in his position and I
look upon this award as a tribute to all those concerned whose efforts
have not been officially recognised.''
Mr Thompson, who received his George Medal at the investiture,
burrowed his way along a disused tunnel to bring a survivor of the roof
fall to safety.
He then returned to the danger area to locate precisely the point
where Mr Shelton lay dead.
''We all did what we had to do on that sad day,'' said Mr Thompson,
who lives in the village of Old Bilsthorpe, near the colliery.
''The bravery and courage of many men may not have been recognised in
the same way but we know who they are and I will never forget how so
many toiled in the terrible conditions following the accident to rescue
colleagues trapped by the roof fall,'' he said.
''If no-one had been killed that day, this award would have meant so
much more.''
Meanwhile, the Princess of Wales's private secretary, Mr Patrick
Jephson, was invested as a Lieutenant of the Royal Victorian Order in
recognition of his service.

SPURNED lover Stephen McGowan confessed yesterday to the killing of
his ex-girlfriend.
Mr McGowan, 30, admitted stabbing nursing sister Irene Duffy 41 times
in her hospital ward.
However, he told the High Court in Glasgow he couldn't remember a
thing ''until I found Irene lying at my feet covered in blood''.
Cross-examined by Advocate-depute Ronald Clancy, prosecuting, he
admitted he must have killed Ms Duffy in her hospital ward.
Mr Clancy told him: ''What happened was that you attacked her because
you were in a rage.''
Mr McGowan, an electrician at the hospital, replied: ''I am certainly
responsible for her death.''
Mr Clancy: You were angry at the break up of your relationship; angry
over access to your son; angry that a reconcilation failed, and so angry
that you threatened to kill her?
Mr McGowan: Yes.
Mr Clancy: You made threatening gestures on a number of occasions and
asked her if she had picked the lining for her coffin? -- Yes.
Mr Clancy: Eventually, after a long-standing grudge, you carried out
these threats. It's as simple as that. -- No reply.
Mr McGowan, of Meadowburn, Bishopbriggs, told how he must have taken a
large hunting knife from his toolbox on the night of the killing.
He told defence QC Gordon Jackson that he could not remember walking
to Stobhill Hospital in Glasgow.
The court has heard how he walked into ward 2A and killed Ms Duffy on
Father's Day -- June 18 this year.
Mr Jackson told him it seemed apparent from the evidence that he had
killed Irene.
''Is that right?'' he asked.
Mr McGowan quietly replied: ''Yes.''
All he could remember was hearing someone screaming and shouting his
name and being taken away in a police car.
Mr Jackson asked him: ''Do you remember stabbing her?'' He replied:
''I don't remember speaking to Irene or seeing her.''
Mr McGowan, however, recalled how, earlier that day, he wrapped up
birthday presents for Christopher and recharged his toy electric car in
preparation for an expected Father's Day visit.
Instead, he got only a brief phone call from his son and the phone
clicked off before he could speak to him.
Mr McGowan spoke of his seven happy years with Ms Duffy before being
devastated when she suddenly left him and had an affair with staff nurse
Patrick Gordon, of Muir Drive, Irvine, Ayrshire.
Mr McGowan said: ''I was pretty devastated. Up until then, Christopher
had been there when I wakened up in the morning and last thing at night.
''Suddenly he wasn't there. It was bad enough him not being there but
Irene was also not there.'' He agreed with Mr Jackson that he loved them
both.
Mr McGowan then told of a series of rows with Ms Duffy over custody of
Christopher in the 17 months leading up to her death.
He claimed she always delayed the hand-over of the boy to him and that
Christopher, in turn, never wanted to go back to his mother.
Mr McGowan went back to live with his parents after the couple's home
at Glenacre Drive, Cumbernauld, was sold.
Nurses told earlier that they fled screaming as Mr McGowan plunged the
knife into Ms Duffy.
Minutes later, she was pleading with doctors: ''Please don't let me
die,'' as Mr McGowan was handcuffed by police.
Efforts to save her failed and she died of massive blood loss. She had
been stabbed in the heart, liver, lungs, throat, head and face, and
limbs.
The trial continues.

THE public health scare involving two bottles of juice allegedly
poisoned after being removed from a Safeway store in Scotland and later
returned to its shelves took an unexpected twist yesterday.
The one-litre bottles of Robinson's Apple and Blackcurrant
concentrate, said to have been contaminated with an unnamed poison, have
now been accounted for.
However, it has emerged that they were destroyed by staff at the
company's Morningside store -- four days before warnings were issued to
the public.
Seventy-three bottles were sold between Monday October 2, when the
contamination was said to have taken place, and last Saturday, October
7.
Yesterday, it was revealed that a male customer bought one bottle on
Tuesday October 3, and later found a broken seal and discolouration. He
returned it to Morningside without drinking the contents.
Police said that, in accordance with Safeway's refund and return
policy, a receipt was issued and the bottle disposed of safely.
They added: ''The employee concerned recalls disposing of two bottles,
the other being in the same condition.''
Last night, Safeway said: ''Since at the time we had no reason to
believe there were any suspicious circumstances related to its return,
the customer's bottle was disposed of.
''This was, as you will appreciate, four days before the announcement
made on Saturday that two bottles had been allegedly contaminated.''

AGREEMENT has been reached between the teachers' union and a local
education authority on the fate of a 15-year-old boy who was suspended
from a Glasgow school for allegedly using threatening behaviour towards
a teacher.
Fifty teachers at St Augustine's Secondary in Milton, Glasgow, had
refused to teach the fourth-year pupil, who was suspended for five days
initially for allegedly threatening to wreck a female teacher's car and
then damage her classroom.
Strathclyde region education chiefs had warned that the teachers could
face disciplinary action if they refused to teach the boy.
The stalemate led to talks between education chiefs and the Glasgow
branch of the teaching union, the EIS, which had claimed that the local
authority had no policy in ''any shape or form'' for dealing with
violent behaviour by pupils.
It seems the situation is now resolved following discussions
yesterday. The pupil is now expected to return to school on Monday,
October 23, at the end of the mid-term holiday, almost four weeks after
he was suspended.
Mr Jack Collins, EIS branch secretary, said yesterday: ''We can say
that progress has been made and we are satisfied that the matter of
violence to staff is now being treated seriously.
''Many of the points we have raised over the last few days have been
conceded. I am confident that the headteacher and staff at St
Augustine's will be able to handle the return of this particular pupil
if that is what his parents wish.''
He said the union and the region would now try to reach agreement on
guidelines and procedures for dealing with violence to staff in schools.

* THINK pink. That's the message for Breast Cancer Awareness Month. To
help increase consciousness of the disease, pink ribbons are being given
out to all Estee Lauder, Aramis and prescriptive customers throughout
the month.
Brookside will also be involved with a storyline that features former
breast cancer patient Patricia Farnham giving away pink ribbons in her
shop and Channel 4 will focus on the latest breast cancer care and
treatment.
Meanwhile, women are urged to send a pink postcard to John Major by
the end of October to call for an increase in funding for research and
treatment.
* WE live in a ''pop-a-pill society'', happily swallowing drugs of
whose side-effects we know very little. The trend is increasing because
many more drugs are now available over the counter without a
prescription, part of the growing policy to encourage us to take
responsibility for our own health. Therefore it's essential we have
information in an accessible form so that we can make informed
decisions.
The revised edition of Which? Medicine offers a practical consumer
guide to more than 1500 medicines. Particularly worrying is the fact
that almost half of all prescriptions are given to people over 65, many
on repeat prescriptions.
Author Rosalind Grant points out that for elderly people, stopping a
medicine may be more beneficial than starting one. She advises: ''Review
your medicines regularly. It's best to take as few as possible and at
the lowest effective dose, in order to reduce the risks of side-effects
and interactions between the medicines.''
Which? Medicine is available from bookshops, or telephone Freephone
0800 252100. Price #12.99.
* ASDA have declared October a VAT-free zone on all own-label and
branded sanitary protection. Their Zap the Vat campaign sees the
reduction of these essential items by 17.5% and runs until November 5.
They are also urging customers to write to their MPs. On average, women
spend #27 per year on sanitary protection of which #5.60 is VAT. This
brings the Government an estimated #30m a year.
* A NATIONAL screening programme to detect early-stage prostate cancer
would not be worthwhile, says a report, Diseases of the Prostate,
published by the Office of Health Economics. They conclude that
treatment options available to men diagnosed with an early-stage
disease, radical prostatectomy and radiotherapy, may do more harm than
good.

United Nations
THE UN official in charge of scrapping Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction said today that Baghdad had gravely misled his inspectors
and had developed far more powerful arms than previously thought.
In a major six-month report to the Security Council, Rolf Ekeus, head
of the UN Special Commission, gave no predictions, however, for when his
inspection would be completed, saying that if Iraq co-operated the work
could go forward quickly.
''The commission's preliminary analysis (reveals) that Iraq has been
concealing proscribed activities and that, consequently, some of the
assessments in the commission's earlier reports have to be reassessed,''
Ekeus said.
''If Iraq were genuinely to translate its statements into action,
there would be a real hope for the completion of the task entrusted to
the Special Commission within a reasonable time-frame,'' he said.
Scrapping weapons of mass destruction is key to lifting the oil
embargo, part of sanctions imposed on Iraq after its troops invaded
Kuwait in 1990.
Meanwhile, the former master of ceremonies in Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein's private office has defected to Britain, an Iraqi opposition
group said today.
The Supreme Council for Islamic Resistance in Iraq said the unnamed
man, who defected ''a few days ago'', had also worked for the foreign
ministry as diplomatic attache and had been consul-general in several
European countries.
The man was closely acquainted with Lieutenant General Hussein Kamel
Hassan, who defected to Jordan on August 8.
The Foreign Office was unable to give details about the defector, who
is believed to have left Baghdad about a year ago and arrived just
recently in London.--Reuter.

FINANCES for the cash-strapped Channel Tunnel would have to be
''re-engineered'', project co-chairman Sir Alastair Morton said in
Edinburgh last night.
Nevertheless, he was optimistic about the future, despite his company,
Eurotunnel, suspending interest payments on #8000m of debt.
He told the audience of several hundred in Edinburgh that getting the
tunnel built and opened had been the first half of the project.
It was now carrying up to 6000 cars, 1800 trucks, and 300 coaches a
day as well as more than 50 passenger and freight trains a day.
''Now, with another 57 years of our concession to operate it, we have
to re-engineer our finances to fit the infrastructure we have built to
carry them. Not an easy task but unlikely to take as long as the nine
years it took to build and open the tunnel.''
Delivering the 1995 John Napier memorial lecture, organised by Napier
University in Edinburgh, Sir Alastair wandered from his prepared speech
several times to elaborate on what he said was the low priority given to
transport by British governments over the years.
The subject of his speech was transport and European integration to
2025, and he predicted that the single European market would swell to 22
or 23 members by 2010.
He said: ''We are talking, if we are serious, about more intermodal
transport, with truck traffic off the roads where possible.
''We are talking about tying the commerce of the enlarged European
economic region together by integrated road, rail, river, and air
transport systems. We are talking about the competitiveness of Europe
versus the Asia Pacific region and North America.''

ANN SHAW discovers it is time to toe the line on foot care.
DID you know that your feet travel up to 15 miles a day, that each
foot sweats about a quarter of an eggcup every 24 hours, and that in an
average lifetime you walk around the world four times?
Given that these facts are true, it's hardly surprising that a recent
survey found three out of four adults have problems with their feet.
Furthermore, 30% of those surveyed confessed they are imprisoning
their feet in shoes which are the wrong size or width, says Clive
Chance, chairman of the Children's Foot Health Register.
You have only got to look at the structure of your foot to see the
potential for problems: each foot has 26 bones, 30 muscles and more than
100 ligaments, so there's ample opportunity for things to go wrong. And
they do, from an early age. The result is that our feet are the most
neglected part of our body.
According to the national ''Footsie Index'' corns and athlete's foot
share joint first place, with bunions coming a close second followed by
crooked toes, ingrown toenails, verrucae, chilblains, and fallen arches.
The trouble starts early on with babies kept in tight sleep suits
which do not allow foot movement, followed by children wearing
unsuitable shoes.
Children can develop problems with their feet as early as one or two
years. Therefore shoes and socks should be checked every six weeks.
Our feet are designed to carry us through a lifetime: when did you
last inspect yours? More to the point, do you regularly lavish attention
on them?
Here are some health tips:
* Stiletto heels should carry a health warning. Worn all the time they
cause bunions, corns and distorted joints. If you must wear them try to
confine them to evening only.
* Never wear the same pair of shoes two days in succession.
* Alternate heel heights.
* Treat your feet to regular footbaths.
* Trim your nails, remove dry skin and use a moisturiser.
Common foot health problems:
* Athlete's Foot: A very contagious fungal infection, common between
the toes. Symptoms include skin peeling, and itching. Easily treated
with anti-fungal creams and powders.
* Verrucae: Common among regular swimmers. Caused by virus, it's
usually seen on the soles of the feet though can occur on other parts of
the foot too. You can treat it yourself, or if this is unsuccessful see
a chiropodist.
* Smelly Feet: The unpleasant smell is caused by bacteria breaking
down the sweat gland secretions. Wash feet at least once daily, pay
particular attention to drying. Use anti-perspirant or deodorant. Change
shoes daily and wear insoles if problem is really bad.

When Sue Frost was diagnosed as having breast cancer, like most
sufferers she feared the worst. Now having beaten the disease, she is
spreading a heartening message to all women that cancer is not
necessarily devastating.
IT'S Breast Cancer Awareness Month, and if you're female and remotely
concerned about your health, you're probably, even now as you read this,
surreptitiously prodding your chest with your fingers crossed.
Either that, or you've glazed over and turned the page. It's not going
to happen to you, is it? And even if it is, wouldn't you rather not
know? Why look for trouble, or spend anxious years anticipating it?
Both these responses to the recent publicity campaigns surrounding
breast cancer are common, and they're also understandable.
We're told that one in 12 women can expect to get it, and that 15,000
women a year die from it. We're also told that it's vital to be
diagnosed early, that the treatment is as bad as the cancer itself, and
that all manner of psychological trauma may follow from mastectomy. No
wonder we're paranoid. In this kind of vision, breast cancer is a
scourge from on high, striking at random with calamitous results.
And yes, it's true, we all know someone who's had it. A sister,
neighbour, best friend or long-lost cousin. Good grief, maybe it's
actually catching!
If I sound a little tetchy, it's because I am.
I've had breast cancer, and while I wouldn't recommend it, it's not
the worst thing that's ever happened to me, nor was my treatment nearly
as unpleasant as I'd been led to expect. I'm now fitter and feel better
than I have for many years. I'm living proof that breast cancer can be
beaten, and guess what? I'm not alone. I'm one among thousands of
healthy, well-adjusted women who once had the disease, and never looked
back.
There are stories you seldom read about, and it seems to me that if
we're to get the breast cancer message across, then instead of scaring
ourselves half to death with statistics, we should be balancing the
tragic news with a bit of good cheer. Perhaps then, women will feel less
shattered when they get that grim diagnosis. They won't be so frightened
about consulting their GPs in the first place, and hopefully, they'll be
more positive when confronted with that unholy trinity: chemotherapy,
radiotherapy and surgery.
When I was first told I had breast cancer, there was reason to feel
gloomy. I hadn't had the early diagnosis that the health-awareness
poster insists upon. On the contrary, I'd been reassured that the lump
in my breast was benign, nothing to worry about.
It was two years before I got a true picture, and by this time the
cancer had spread to the lymph nodes under my arm.
Nobody would tell me whether I might be cured, what my chances of
survival were. I had to undergo bone, liver and lung scans before anyone
would so much as suggest I might live to see my children grow up. And
even then, they seemed to have a curious habit of turning to stare out
of the window whenever I asked.
But I was lucky. My local hospital had an excellent breast clinic, run
by a cancer specialist who convinced me that in his care I'd get the
best possible treatment. A surgeon himself, he was quick to point out
that he wouldn't be the one to save me. Breast surgery, I learned, was a
mop-up method of dealing with cancer, a bit of insurance after the main
event. And the main event was chemotherapy.
Much has been written about the traumas of chemo; the nausea, the hair
loss, the unhappy realisation that the stuff coursing round your veins
is, in effect, poison.
And certainly it's sobering to be faced with a chemo nurse wearing
protective gloves, apron, and mask. The drugs she's about to pump into
your body are so powerful they mustn't be spilt on the skin.
But these are precious poisons, they kill cancer cells. Okay, they
make your hair fall out. So what? It grows again very quickly, and in
the meantime, it's amazing just how unimportant going bald becomes. I
even fancied that I looked rather alluring with my shiny pate, like
something out of Star Trek (although I must confess, I didn't venture
outside my own four walls in this naked state).
My point is not to make light of cancer or chemo. It's terrible to be
told you have cancer, and not everyone withstands chemotherapy as
comfortably as I did. But I believe it is important to say that neither
cancer, nor its treatment, is necessarily devastating. Half of all
cancers are now curable. That's pretty good odds, and anything that
enhances them, like heavy-duty chemo, has to be welcomed.
After chemo, I had surgery, and then five weeks of radiotherapy. At
the same time, I went for homeopathic treatment and got in touch with
the famed Bristol Cancer Help Centre for advice about diet and vitamins.
I had hypnotherapy to help me relax, aromatherapy because it felt nice,
and acupuncture because I'd never tried it before and thought, hang it,
I might as well try everything.
I don't know how significant any of these things were in my recovery,
but I know they made me feel a whole lot better. They gave me a sense of
being in control.
Since I wrote about my experience in Woman magazine, I've had many
letters from other cancer survivors, women who are just getting on with
the business of living, who'd once thought the end was in sight, but who
now stand witness to the advance of medical science and the
indomitability of the human spirit.
I needed those letters, and I believe that other women need my
testimony, too, women who've just been diagnosed, who suspect they've
got cancer, or who've simply read the publicity and feel frightened in
case they get the disease.
It's right that women should be warned about breast cancer and
encouraged to examine themselves. It's right that they recognise the
importance of early diagnosis, and know they can insist on consulting a
cancer specialist. It's right that they understand all the treatment
options available, and have the information to make choices.
It's wrong that they should be panicked into thinking breast cancer is
the worst thing since the Black Death.

Washington
THE O J Simpson interview which was to be broadcast tonight was
abruptly cancelled today.
The television network, NBC, had informed Simpson of some of the
questions its interviewers intended to put. He objected and said that he
would not answer them, so NBC pulled the plug.
The network had been faced by a deluge of protests, and also
contemplated having the largest audience in history.
The Los Angeles chapter of the National Organisation of Women planned
a massive demonstration outside the studio tonight, and had to settle
instead for a brief, astonished, victory press conference on the
pavement.
Other networks had competed strenuously to get the interview.
When they failed, they scrapped their usual evening shows, to replace
them with old film re-runs, on the assumption that no-one would watch
anything else. ABC had to stick to a baseball game, for contract
reasons, and was presumably pleased with itself when the O J show was
cancelled.
Initially, Simpson intended to protect himself on NBC by having his
lawyer, Johnnie Cochran, in the studio to advise him when to refuse to
answer.
The justification for this unusual arrangement was that Simpson faces
a civil suit from the family of Ron Goldman, the man he was acquitted of
murdering, along with his wife.
When NBC announced the cancellation, its anchorman said: ''Mr Simpson
and his lawyer decided that they could not abide by the original
agreement'' for a no-holds-barred interview.
The excuse they offered was the civil suit.

THE Scottish National Party emphasised its environmental credentials
yesterday by calling for an independent inquiry into the dumping of
ageing munitions off the West Coast of Scotland.
Its call came as Strathclyde Police confirmed that more than 1000
yellow devices, which burst into flames when dried, have so far been
washed up on Argyll and Clyde Coast beaches in recent days.
The munitions may have come from Beaufort's Dyke, the half-mile deep
channel in the Irish Sea which was used as a munitions dump after the
two world wars.
SNP environment spokeswoman Roseanna Cunningham said yesterday that an
independent inquiry into ''the cocktail of waste'' dumped off the
Scottish coast was needed in order to discover the extent of the
contamination and what possible dangers it posed.
''We know that munitions were dumped at sea. We know that munitions
are being washed ashore. What we do not know is how much was dumped and
what type of material was dumped. Government secrecy about this matter
does not inspire public confidence in safety.
''The Government must act now to reassure the people of South-west
Scotland by commissioning an independent inquiry,'' she said.
The SNP's national secretary, Mr Alasdair Morgan, who was chosen by
the party this week to contest former Scottish Secretary Ian Lang's
Galloway and Upper Nithsdale constituency, claimed Mr Lang's
''inactivity'' over the munitions was totally inappropriate.
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth has already expressed his concerns
to Defence Secretary Michael Portillo.

Sarajevo
THE Bosnia-wide ceasefire went into effect at one minute after
midnight this morning.
The capital Sarajevo was quiet, its gas and electricity supplies
restored as part of the conditions for the truce. The city was under a
curfew that began at 10pm and, except for patrolling security forces,
the streets were deserted.
A policeman at a checkpoint on Tito Street, the main thoroughfare,
shrugged when asked about the truce, and said: ''Wait and see''.
A big blast rocked the city about 40 minutes before the truce. Police
could not tell whether it was a shell or a gas explosion triggered by
the resumption of supplies to households through war-damaged underground
pipes.
US President Bill Clinton welcomed the ceasefire agreement and called
on all parties to abide by its terms.
Meanwhile, in Brussels, Bosnian Foreign Minister Mohamed Sacirbey said
that ethnic cleansing in western Bosnia was a threat to the long-term
chances for peace.
He said: ''If ethnic cleansing continues that is not a ceasefire. We
will not sit idly by while a different war takes place, a war of ethnic
cleansing.''
The Bosnian government's crack 5th Corps said its latest battlefield
advances had laid the ground for ''liberating'' the Serb strongholds of
Prijedor and Banja Luka in northern Bosnia.
Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic said in Frankfurt that he
expected the ceasefire to go into effect at midnight, but that the army
would keep fighting until then.
Bosnian Serb foreign minister Aleksa Buha said: ''I hope both sides
will respect their obligations . . . and that we're making a big step
towards peace.''
The Serbs earlier had accused the government of deliberately delaying
the start of the 60-day ceasefire so it could capture more territory.
UN officials also suggested the postponement was related to government
gains. ''That argument can certainly be sustained by what is happening
on the ground,'' said Lieutenant Colonel Chris Vernon.
Red Cross officials reported up to 30,000 Serbs were fleeing the area
of government gains around Sanski Most while a further 10,000 were
flocking to the Serb stronghold at Banja luka.
The Serbs conceded they had lost the nearby town of Mrkonjic Grad,
located on a key road considered by many as a virtually natural border
between areas controlled by the Serbs, and by the Muslim-led government
and its Croat allies.
The UN also said the government launched a strong offensive on Mount
Vis, in northeast Bosnia, from where shells were fired in recent days
that killed refugees and a UN soldier.
The government also was pressing an offensive south of Sarajevo,
trying to put its soldiers into position to link up with the eastern
enclave Gorazde.
Serbs were reported to be stepping up their campaign to purge areas
they hold in northwestern Bosnia of all non-Serbs.
Red Cross and UN aid officials expressed alarm over reports of rape,
murder, death threats and robberies of mainly Muslim refugees straggling
into government-held territory.
''In the latest wave (of explusions) we see no grain of humanity,''
said International Red Cross spokesman John Sparrow. ''Things have again
spiraled completely out of control.''
Kris Janowski, spokesman for the UN aid agency, said expulsions were
accelerating. About 6000 people already have been expelled and up to
8000 more were expected in the next few days.
A 4pm unilateral deadline set by the Bosnian government for Serb
assent to the ceasefire had passed without word from the Serb side.
Bosnian government minister Hasan Muratovic said earlier the ceasefire
would be delayed by 24 hours unless the Serbs met the deadline.
''But I am sure they will comply with the request and there will be a
ceasefire from midnight and I hope it will be the last day of the war,''
said Muratovic, who is minister for relations with the United Nations.
He said the deadline was imposed because the government needed time to
inform its troops in the field.
The ceasefire was orginally planned to start on yesterday but was
delayed because the government was not satisfied that preconditions
concerning the restoration of utilities to Sarajevo had been met.
Last night the government offered a new start time of Thursday
morning, but the Serb delegation at the truce talks said they did not
have the authority to accept the offer at that point.--Reuter/AP.

THE first nurses in Scotland to be given special training in the
treatment of patients with cancer graduated yesterday from Glasgow
University.
The one-year diploma reflects the growing awareness that cancer
sufferers require specialised nursing care.
Mrs Fiona White, in the centre of our picture with the grauates, is
the Cancer Relief Macmillan Fund-sponsored lecturer on the course.
She said an important part of the course dealt with patients'
rehabilitation.
''The course looks at when someone is diagnosed with cancer and shows
it's not an automatic death sentence,'' said Mrs White.
''People can live a long time, but with the shadow of cancer around
them. Nurses must realise that patients have to be rehabilitated back
into their families and work.''
There were two periods of work experience at the Beatson Oncology
Centre and wards at Glasgow Royal Infirmary.
Top student was Morven Miller, who transferred from her job at Ross
Hall during the course to the Beatson Oncology Centre's acute area.

THE two councils singled out by Mr Forsyth yesterday hit back at his
criticisms.
Responding to his remarks about councillors' allowances, the leader of
the administration on the new Dundee City Council, Councillor Kate
Maclean, said: ''Mr Forsyth should remember that it was the Scottish
Office who set the basic allowance for councillors at #6000.
''The payment of special responsibility allowances in the new Dundee
City Council follows the Cosla guidelines, which have all-party
support.''
She also said Mr Forsyth should ''check his facts''. ''His claim that
allowances have risen by 54% in Dundee is wide of the mark. In fact, the
rise is nearer 20%, which is in recognition of the increased workload of
councillors.''
The councillor added: ''Unjustified criticism like this from the
Secretary of State is unhelpful and has more to do with point-scoring.''
The convener of the new Inverclyde Council, Councillor Catherine
Allan, said Mr Forsyth's observation that it was spending about #1m on
the salaries of 20 executives was ''roughly'' correct.
However, she added: ''Mr Forsyth has not had an overall look at what
our staff structure is going to be. He should allow us to finish before
he makes points about it. At this stage, it is nitpicking.''
She envisaged that total wage costs in the new authority would be
''comparable'' with the outgoing council set-up.

Labour parrot the words. We believe in them. That is why they are not
fit to govern.
MICHAEL HESELTINE yesterday launched a fierce personal attack on Mr
Tony Blair, accusing him of ''nauseating hypocrisy'' in seeking
educational advantage for his own son while planning to ban such
opportunities for other parents if Labour won power.
The direct assault showed that the gloves are really off and that the
next General Election campaign already has begun.
Mr Heseltine highlighted Mr Blair's decision to send his son, Euan, to
the selective London Oratory School rather than to his local Islington
comprehensive.
He linked it to the Labour Party conference decision to abolish the
Assisted Places scheme which pays for talented children of poorer
families to attend independent schools.
The Deputy Prime Minister told the party conference at Blackpool: ''I
cannot understand the nauseating hypocrisy that is prepared to accept so
much for himself (Mr Blair went to Fettes), to bestow so much on his own
child, and yet to deny to 70,000 children, talented like him, to escape,
as he escaped, as he has helped his own child to escape, from the
inadequacy of inner city comprehensives.
''No more can I tolerate the nauseating hypocrisy of fashionable
Labour MPs who move to leafy suburbs to send their children to
middle-class comprehensives whilst kicking the ladders of opportunity
from beneath the feet of inner-city children whose parents cannot afford
to move.
''They call it socialism. I call it social engineering.
Experimentation at someone else's expense -- with someone else's
children.''
Mr Heseltine brought the representatives to their feet with a fighting
speech in which he rejected ''defeatism'' about the party's prospects at
the next election.
He said that the conference could be a turning point for them as the
Battle of Alamein was for Britain in the Second World War.
He maintained his attack on Mr Blair accusing him of being a turncoat
who had switched from supporting Labour's 1983 manifesto --
''red-blooded socialism from cover to cover'' -- to his present
about-turn.
He also gave a public pledge of loyalty to John Major, sitting
alongside, telling representatives: ''If people ask me now about by new
job as Deputy Prime Minister, my answer is, 'I'm going to help you,
Prime Minister to win'.
''To win because you are a far better Prime Minister than Tony Blair
could ever be.
''To win because your policies are clearer, more consistent and more
honest than those of the Labour Party.
''To win because under your leadership Britain has a chance unequalled
in my political lifetime to excel in this tough, ever more competitive
world.''
Mr Heseltine received his customary long and rapturous standing
ovation from a conference entertained by a string of jokes.
Mr Blair was like the time-serving Vicar of Bray, he said, but should
remember that the vicar never became a bishop.
He also accused the Labour leader of treating his Shadow Cabinet with
contempt turning instead to spin doctors like Peter Mandelson and
Alastair Campbell.
Brandishing a copy of the 1979 manifesto, Mr Heseltine said the
principles of pushing back the frontiers of the state encapsulated in it
then were still what he and Mr Major believed in now.
Contrasting it to the ''red-blooded socialism'' of Labour's manifesto
four years ago, he recalled: ''Twenty years ago I stood in this hall and
warned you about the Labour Party -- a one-legged army limping from the
wreckage of their policies.''
Then, to laughter, he limped exaggeratedly across the stage on one
leg, shouting: ''Left, left, left . . . that didn't work.
''About turn! Right, right, right . . .
''But what they forgot to tell you was that it was the Tories who were
right, right and right again.
''No wonder Labour is out of step. We're all confused.''
He told Mr Blair: ''You may be able to stitch up the unions behind
closed doors. You may be able to bully the media. You may claim secret
deals with British companies -- all in a bid for political power.
''Well I'll tell you who you can't bully. I'll tell you with whom
there will be no secret deals. The British people are not for sale.''.
Mr Heseltine tackled head on Labour's criticisms of 16 years of
Conservative government. Strikes, high inflation and loss making state
industries had gone. Over-powerful unions and one-sided disarmers had
gone too.
''In 16 years, we have turned the sick man of Europe into one of
Europe's most envied economies,'' and he claimed that ''our achievements
will stand the test of time.''
Britain had the highest proportion of people at work of any major
European economy. It had excellent industrial relations, record exports,
world class privatised companies, falling electrcity, gas and telephone
prices and falling crime rates. Above all, it had low inflation.
However, the Tories must win again to continue with the long term
modernisation of Britain. Only Tories instinctively understood that
companies must give the customers what they wanted. ''Labour parrot the
words. We believe in them. That is why they are not fit to govern.''
Labour, he added, would hand back education powers from parents to
local councils, replace competitive tendering with direct Labour
monopolies, restore ''unions' rights to abuse us'', politically control
the independent industry regulators.
''They can't even keep their hands off the Lottery. They hate
success.''
Mr Heseltine succeeded in enthusing his audience, whom he told to get
off their seats, return to their constituencies and begin the fight to
gain the party a fifth term in power.

SCOTTISH Secretary Michael Forsyth's attack on alleged abuses of power
in local government sparked a furious response from opposition parties,
councils, and trade unions yesterday.
If there was any doubt that the fragile truce which has existed
recently between the Scottish Office and local authorities was not
already over, Mr Forsyth's comments and the strength of the anger which
greeted them made it absolutely clear that normal hostilities have
resumed.
The reaction included a call from the public sector union Unison for
the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (Cosla) to withdraw from a
joint task force recently set up with the Scottish Office. Cosla does
not intend to withdraw.
Professor Arthur Midwinter of Strathclyde University accused the
Scottish Secretary of ''inconsistency'' in his approach to local
government but in relation to Mr Forsyth's accusation that some new
councils were operating a ''jobs for the boys'' policy over making
senior appointments, he said he believed there had clearly been ''some
questionable practices''.
He supported the view put forward recently by Staff Commission
chairman Robert Peggie that local government should consider setting up
some form of permanent mechanism to oversee the practices used by local
authorities in making appointments. It was important for the public
sector to be seen to be ''squeaky clean''.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson said there was a ''strong
smell of hypocrisy'' in Mr Forsyth's remarks. ''It is bare-faced cheek
for the party which forced through this expensive and unnecessary
council carve-up now to denounce councils who are having to put in place
new personnel to guide the new structure.''
In a reference to Mr Gerald Warner, appointed by Mr Forsyth to the
civil service post of special adviser at the Scottish Office, Mr
Robertson said the pen behind the Scottish Secretary's words had been
wielded by ''a #40,000-a-year speech writer''. He added: ''A battalion
of overpaid, privatised utility fat cats bear witness to the double
standards of the Scottish Secretary.''
Mr Robertson said: ''If Mr Forsyth has evidence of malpractice, let
him use his powers to act and I will support him. If he believes that
there is waste in appointments, he can and should act. If he has
evidence of council committees excluding opposition representatives,
then he should name them and I will see that our party policy on balance
is implemented.''
He accused Mr Forsyth of rabble-rousing to get some ''cheap applause''
at the Blackpool conference.
Both the Scottish National Party and the Liberal Democrats also
accused Mr Forsyth of hypocrisy but at the same time they joined the
Scottish Secretary in attacking Labour councils.
Councillor Maureen Watt, SNP vice-convener for local government, said:
''Since the Tories are responsible for creating Scotland's local
government system -- although they do not control a single council --
Michael Forsyth's attacks are somewhat hypocritical.''
She added: ''Tory attacks on local government from above and Labour's
abuse of power from within are two sides of the same undemocratic coin
in Scotland. What Scotland needs is genuine local and national democracy
with both tiers working in partnership with each other.''
Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Jim Wallace said: ''From a Government
which has appointed more placemen to quangos than ever before, Mr
Forsyth's statement smacks of hypocrisy. If he is serious about tackling
undemocratic practices, he should be rolling back Scotland's unelected
state.''
However, he added: ''Labour local authorities do need to behave in a
more responsible manner. It is a travesty of democracy that they can get
away with appointing unbalanced committees and changing council
procedures to help themselves.''
Cosla protested that Mr Forsyth's ''continuous sniping'' at local
government was doing no one any good at all.
President Rosemary McKenna said: ''It is invidious of him to cite
individual authorities as he has done. Each of the new councils has the
same range of responsibilities and it was the Government who decided
that management structures should be decided by the councils
themselves.''
Councillor McKenna said Mr Forsyth's remarks about salaries for
council officers were particularly offensive: ''He is talking about
officers who are working full-time for their authorities and often
working evenings and weekends.''
On councillors' special responsibility allowances, she said these had
been recommended by Cosla, at the behest of the Scottish Office, to take
account of the commitment made by senior councillors which involved much
more than a normal 35 or 40-hour working week.
''Compare this to the Secretary of State's appointees on quangos who
receive vast sums of money each year for a few days' work each month.''
Professor Midwinter, whose book Local Government in Scotland. Reform
or Decline? is due to be published tomorrow, said that, on one hand Mr
Forsyth had spoken of following the model of former Labour Scottish
Secretary Tom Johnston and seeking consensus -- ''finding the 80% of
things people agree on and getting on with that''.
At the same time, however, he was now attacking councils on a number
of fronts and seemed to be pushing such highly partisan policies as the
opting out of schools and more competitive tendering for council
services so that they would become enablers rather than direct providers
of services.
''If he wants to have a partnership with local authorities, he can't
determine the terms of it. That has to be negotiated with them.''
Mr Forsyth's claims that some new councils were employing too many
highly paid officials appeared to be based on this enabling model which
would allow for a much smaller management structure because most of the
service provision had been contracted out.
However, it did not exist in Scotland, where very few private
companies had been successful in bidding to run council services, he
said.
Mr Mark Irvine, Unison's head of local government in Scotland, said:
''It is clear that the Scottish Secretary's agenda is solely about
attacking local government and that we are not going to have a dialogue
with him.''
Therefore, he said, Unison would be urging Cosla to withdraw
co-operation from the joint task force with the Scottish Office.

IF Mr Portillo brought a touch of the Larry Oliviers to the previous
day, yesterday gave us Sir Henry Irving, ably impersonated by the First
Secretary of State and Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Michael Heseltine.
Hezza has been laying them is the aisles at Tory conferences for a
couple of decades now. Like Sir Henry, one can say that even if the
performance verges on the hammy, it is high-quality ham.
Also, like that other great actor-manager, who did not always appear
in things as good as Shakespeare, he can be impressive even if the
performance derives little nourishment from the script.
He has the advantage of all famed performers that the audience expect
him to be great and are quite capable of convincing themselves that he
is great even when he falls below his best.
He had to compensate for the poor quality of this year's jokes with
some expressive mugging and significant pauses, just as lesser actors
have to do when the author has omitted to give them lines that will
raise a laugh without.
However, Heseltine below his best is still better value than many a
political orator at his best, and it was not all style.
He gave a brief rundown of Conservative achievements in their last 16
years, which is probably virtually the one the party will use in the
election campaign.
Labour's decision to abolish assisted places freed him to make a
ferocious personal attack on Mr Blair with a power which is simply
beyond Mr Major's vocal reach.
A ringing declaration that the British people could not be bought made
one wonder for a moment if tax cuts are proving impossible, but it was
Mr Blair that he was warning off.
In the search for patriotic buzz words which Mr Portillo had omitted
from his speech he came upon Dunkirk. Where we are now might seem like
Dunkirk was his message but remember Alamein. Most of the audience were
at school when history teaching was history teaching so they probably
did.
This conference was a turning point like Alamein, he stormed. The
representatives certainly wanted to believe it, although in the trickle
of not very exciting announcements and the unremarkable speeches (if we
omit Larry Portillo) so far there has not been much indication why it
should be.
Still, giving Mr Heseltine a longer standing ovation than anyone apart
from the leader -- a protected species as far as ovations are concerned
-- is a conference tradition and Conservatives have to respect
tradition.
Besides, as the Sketch overheard a former right wing MP tell an
acolyte: ''He is a class act.'' And class deserves a salute even when
operating at less then full power.
Mr Peter Lilley is usually the wittiest speaker at the conference, and
he maintained a good track record, making it odd that he is one
''bastard'' who is never tipped to wear the crown.
The conference, which wildly cheered calls to cut social security
spending, also wildly cheered a call to discount the family home in
calculating help with residential care -- quite a worthy aim but sending
the social security budget in quite the other direction.
The conference organisers are so in love with their film about 16
wonderful Tory years, ''Up Where You Belong,'' that they are showing it
at the start of each session.
The Sketch, who had a preview, has seen it five times, the audience
four. It is a dissuasion from arriving in the hall on time.
But it is applauded after each showing. This may be just politeness.
Or the representatives may all be the kind of people who went to see
''The Sound of Music'' 50 times or keep on going back to ''Les
Miserables''. Or they could just be desperately seeking reassurance.
Dunkirk or Alamein? They will have a better idea after tomorrow's
matinee performance.

COMPUTERISED ''smart cards'' to stamp out benefit fraud will be
introduced next year, Social Security Secretary Peter Lilley told the
conference yesterday.
He told representatives that ''the taxpayer's inflexible friend'' was
part of his strategy to crack down on benefit cheats.
He said ''It will make sure that the right money goes to the right
people. It will stop wrong people bending the system.''
The successful pilot scheme rewarding post office staff who detect
fraud is to be extended nationwide.
He also said that companies who offer better than statutory level sick
pay to employees will be freed from Government regulation.
Mr Lilley attacked Labour's plan for an increased guaranteed minimum
state pension. ''Sounds great. But what it means is means-testing and
that's a penalty on savings. The prudent will pay twice. Once for
themselves and again through taxes for imprudent.''
He claimed that Government schemes to help lone parents into work were
succeeding. In the last two years, 130,000 lone parents had come off
income support.
However, he faced calls from conference speakers to do more to
restrict benefits to lone parents who did not come into the category of
widowed, divorced or deserted.
Harrow representative Lurline Champagne protested that the social
security ship was ''overloaded with hangers-on, luggage and abusive
passengers'' and was bound to sink.
Tories cared about people who through no fault of their own were
suffering because of the recession, said Mrs Champagne.
To cheers, she said: ''They can have no help because the one-parent
family blocks the system. Find the absent fathers and make them pay.''
Mr Richard Ashworth (Hastings and Rye) criticised the
''irresponsible'' behaviour of couples who had children and then put the
burden of looking after them ''on normal, hardworking, ordinary British
men and women.''
Mrs Eleanor Lang (Ealing and Acton) was applauded when she called for
the family home to he excluded from calculation of savings when help
with residential care costs was sought.
''It is not fair'' she said. ''That people of modest means should be
forced to sell their family home in order to pay for
* Responding to Mr Lilley's announcement, Age Concern said the ''smart
cards'' had to be more than just a piece of plastic and warned they
could penalise pensioners.
The organisation's director general, Sally Greencross, said the
workings of the new system had to be explained clearly well in advance
of the card's introduction as many elderly people had difficulty in
understanding new technology.

PAYMENT of benefits to people seeking asylum in Britain and other
groups of arrivals from overseas are to be curbed, Social Security
secretary Peter Lilley announced to the conference.
The changes will affect about 50,000 persons and save about #200m a
year.
Mr Lilley said that although 40,000 people a year claim asylum, only
one in 20 is found to be a genuine case. Yet, until their appeal against
refusal of asylum is rejected they are entitled to a range of
non-contributory benefits.
Under the new rules, which will have to be approved by Parliament, no
benefit will be payable from the moment the first claim for residence is
refused by the asylum division of the Home Office.
Mr Lilley explained that 70% of those who claim asylum do not arrive
as refugees but enter the UK as visitors, tourists or students, on the
undestanding that they will maintain themselves and not have access to
benefits.
''However,'' he said, ''if they subsequently claim asylum, that not
only prolongs their stay but also gives them the right to claim benefits
at the tax payers expense. This surely cannot be right.
''Moreover the number of asylum claims has escalated partly because of
the availability of benefits. The proportion of applicants found to have
valid claims to refugee status has fallen from 32% to 4% between 1984
and 1994.''
The Government therefore proposed that those who claimed asylum after
they had entered the UK would no longer be entitled to any benefit.
An exception will be made for nationals of a country where the Home
Secretary judges that ''a significant upheaval'' has occured since they
entered the UK.
Other rule changes will curb payments to immigrants accepted on
condition they are maintained by a sponsor. The DSS said that in 1992
around half the 3450 sponsored immigrants admitted claim benefit despite
the sponsor's guarantee.
The Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants later condemned the
Government's decision.

TRANSPORT Secretary Sir George Young confirmed at the conference
yesterday that at least 51% of Railtrack will be sold off next spring.
Afterwards, he said, the entire company -- which owns 20,000 miles of
rail track and made a profit of #305m last year -- could be put on the
market, but a decision has not yet been taken.
He promised that, while there will be a stake for the staff, there
would be no share bonanza for the board.
'This will free Railtrack from the constraints of public borrowing to
make faster progress with the West Coast main line. We will set the
railways free as we set British Telecom free,'' he said.
No longer would it be a public sector dinosaur but instead
''consumer-conscious companies'', winning back old passengers and
attracting new ones.
Sir George insisted that safety would not be compromised in the
sell-off and mocked Labour's pledge of a publicly-owned and publicly
accountable rail network.
''If you are going to buy back what we sell, how will you pay for
it?'' he asked.
''Higher fares? Higher taxes? Higher borrowing? Until you answer, you
are not fit for government.
Sir George also signalled the end of the huge road-building programme
of previous decades.
He said: ''The key is not to build more roads but to make more
intelligent use of the ones we have.'' This would mean better
maintenance, enhancing their capacity and moving bottlenecks and danger
spots.
During the debate, Mr David Sharpe, prospective parliamentary
candidate for Strathkelvin and Bearsden, called for development of the
London-Glasgow West Coast line to be ''in the front line for
modernisation''.
Mr Peter Davies (Croydon South) said Labour's pledge to renationalise
the railways could cost as much as #14bn. He said Mr Jimmy Knapp had
''got everything he wants from the Scottish socialist mafia in the
Shadow Cabinet.''
Mr Graham Nalty (Erewash) called for British Rail to develop 180mph
trains and run them from London through Birmingham and Manchester to
Glasgow as a single service rather than three separate ones which he
forecast would attract many more passengers.
A spring sale date for Railtrack was enthusiastically welcomed by the
company's chairman, Robert Horton, but fiercely criticised by the
leaders of the two main rail unions.
Mr Horton said the privatisation announcement was ''excellent news for
the entire railway industry, for train operators and above all for rail
users''.
However, Mr Jimmy Knapp, leader of the Rail, Maritime and Transport
union, said the spring 1996 sell-off date was ''disastrous news for the
railways''.
Mr Lew Adams, head of the train drivers' union Aslef, said privatising
Railtrack was an example of ''putting profits ahead of safety''.
Shadow Transport Secretary Michael Meacher said after Sir George's
speech: ''Transport has now become a serious embarrassment to the
Tories.
''The increasingly desperate Transport Secretary is reduced to
repeating pledges about selling off Railtrack 'in the spring'.
''But he has nothing to say about what price Railtrack will be sold
for or even how he intends to overcome the mountain of problems that
face the sell-off.''
Mr Meacher said the fact Sir George was only talking about selling
just over half of Railtrack ''exposes the chaos that privatisation has
become''.

MOTORISTS who do not pay their car tax will in future face clamping
and heavy fines, Transport Secretary Sir George Young told the
conference yesterday.
He said: ''Vehicle tax evasion is a serious problem which costs the
taxpayer more than #163m a year and I'm determined to stamp it out.
''Far too many drivers think they can get away with keeping untaxed
vehicles on the road. My message to them is clear -- get a tax disc or
get the Boot.''
The Denver Boot clamps will go into action early next year in a pilot
scheme in the London borough of Kensington and Chelsea.
The rest of London will follow and if the scheme is successful it will
be extended to other parts of the country by the end of the year.
This will require legislation -- already in place as far as London is
concerned.
A Scottish Office spokesman said: ''We will be watching the pilot
scheme with interest.''
Motorists who can provide a disc which may have fallen off their
windscreen or were a few days late renewing the licence will escape.
Before any car is clamped, its details will be checked against the
Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency's records.
It will cost #68 to have a vehicle released from the clamp. If it is
impounded, this cost increases to #135 plus any storage charges. If an
excise licence cannot be produced at the time it will cost a further
#100 refundable if the licence is produced within 14 days.
If the licence is not produced within 14 days, the #100 may be
forfeited and prosecution action taken which could result in further
fines.
Sir George did not take up a passionate plea for the abolition of
Excise tax from Mr Simon Fawthrop (Lewisham West) who said it was ''an
iniquitous tax'' which took no account of ability to pay or how much a
vehicle was used.
He called for it to be scrapped and the revenue made up by increasing
the duty on petrol and derv.
Motoring organisations welcomed the Government plans to wheelclamp
road tax dodgers.
However, the RAC warned that the Denver Boot should only be used ''as
a last resort.''
''We welcome the plan and would support any measure that cracks down
on the hard core of people who refuse to pay their vehicle excise
duty,'' said RAC head of public policy Jeremy Vanke.
He added: ''Ideally, we would like the clampers to also contact the
owners before they do any clamping. We don't want willy-nilly clamping
-- that would be going over the top.''
The AA said: ''We broadly welcome the scheme but we would like to see
it as a deterrent rather than anything else.''
The spokesman added ''If the scheme is introduced, we will monitor it
carefully.''

<FLAG>ANNUAL CONFERENCE,</FLAG>

FORMER Chancellor Norman Lamont yesterday launched a radical plan to
scrap the 40% top rate income tax band.
He condemned the top rate as a ''relic of socialism'' and branded high
taxes as the root cause of Government unpopularity in the Tory
heartlands.
Failed leadership challenger John Redwood stepped back into the fray
with a renewed demand for an immediate #5 billion off the overall tax
burden financed by a fierce crackdown on public sector waste, fraud and
inefficiency.
He said: ''Cutting taxes is a moral crusade.''
The combined attack from the right at fringe meetings at the Tory
conference in Blackpool were designed to pile pressure on Chancellor
Kenneth Clarke on the eve of the key economy debate.
At another fringe meeting, President of the Board of Trade Ian Lang
held out of prospect of tax cuts ahead.
The leadership is already under intense pressure from the Tory
grassroots to deliver tax cuts in the Budget next month -- with dozens
of motions demanding swift action.
Mr Lamont, sacked 1993 after the economic disaster of Black Wednesday
in 1992 and now looking for a new constituency following boundary
changes, said it was vital for the Government to make more progress.
''In 1979 the threshold at which people started to pay tax at 40% was
very nearly twice average earnings. Last year you only needed an income
40% above the national average to face a marginal tax rate of 40%,'' he
said.
''The burden of taxation on many natural Conservative supporters has
risen quite sharply. This is one of the most important causes of the
Government's unpopularity in the Conservative heartlands.
''In the longer term our aim should be to do better than where we were
in 1979. Having an upper rate at all is a relic of socialism.
''Many people believe that the tax system should be progressive, that
people on higher incomes should pay a higher proportion of tax. But you
don't need a higher rate band to do this -- you just need high personal
allowances.''
Mr Lamont said an important first step to tax reform was to raise the
40% threshold on mortgage relief -- currently at #23,700 -- after a
five-year freeze.
At a separate meeting, Mr Redwood, who campaigned for the leadership
on a radical tax-cutting platform, called for the abolition of VAT on
fuel and progress towards fuel price cuts through tougher regulation of
the privatised utilities.
''Cutting VAT on fuel and these price cuts could deliver a great boost
to the Government's anti-inflation strategy and would be a good riposte
to Labour's windfall tax,'' he said.
''It's time for customers and taxpayers to receive more of the
benefits of the success of these companies.
''We said we would make progress to a standard rate of 20p. There are
two ways of doing this -- cutting the standard rate by 1p or widening
the band for 20p. As money is tight, I would widen the band this year.''
Meanwhile, Mr Lang insisted that lower taxes should not be seen as
''an electoral bribe'' but as a way to stimulate and reward enterprise.
At a Tory Reform Group fringe meeting, Mr Lang said the state had to
be taken out of the marketplace ''to fulfil our commitment to drive down
public spending to below 40% of our national product and free the
wealth-creating sectors to propel our economy forward''.
The US, Japan and Switzerland, three of the most advanced economies in
the world, had the smallest percentage of national product taken by
government spending, said Mr Lang.
''With a more limited state, we can benefit from the inevitable
consequence -- lower taxes.''

<HEADLINE>Scots arts funding iniquitous, says Gowrie</HEADLINE>

THE chairman of the Arts Council for England last night launched a
scathing attack on the ''iniquitous'' level of arts funding in Scotland,
accusing the Government of favouring those who had ''no intention'' of
voting Tory.
The Earl of Gowrie, a former Tory Arts Minister, criticised the
Government's decision to impose a two-year, #10m cut on his budget for
funding the arts in England without imposing a similar cut on Scotland.
''This is an iniquity,'' he said.
Speaking at a fringe meeting in Blackpool attended by Heritage
Secretary Virginia Bottomley, Lord Gowrie said the Government had cut
the English Arts Council's budget in real terms by #10m to #191m. The
cut had fallen ''on England alone''.
It was unfair to place the burden on England, he said, when it voted
Tory, and not on Scotland or Wales, which did not. ''It always amazed me
how the Tories can thump those who vote for them, as against those who
have absolutely no intention of doing so. This has caused quite a lot of
trouble and difficulty.''
In reply, Mrs Bottomley refused to be drawn into the detail of his
criticism. But she said: ''I understand what Lord Gowrie is saying. I
also understand that we live in a time when there has been a great
flowering of funding sources. There is, of course, a role for
Government. I shall certainly do all I can to ensure that we continue to
support the arts in this country.''
In 1994 the Arts Council for Great Britain was disbanded and
responsibility for arts funding was passed to the national bodies in
England, Scotland and Wales. The Scottish Arts Council receives about
#23m a year, of which #9m goes to the Royal Scottish Orchestra, the
Scottish Chamber Orchestra, Scottish Ballet and Scottish Opera.
The Eton and Oxford-educated Lord Gowrie, 55, became chairman of the
English Arts Council that year. He was Arts Minister under Mrs Thatcher
in 1984-85.

THE Tory manifesto for the next General Election campaign in Scotland
was laid out yesterday by Secretary of State Michael Forsyth, as he
outlined a new strategy to deliver power to ordinary people.
It was a message which combined condemnation of home rule with a
commitment to decentralisation and what he described as real devolution
of Government power down to the man and woman in the street.
It also made clear that although the Secretary of State may be in his
new populist, listening mode, he still sees himself as a standard bearer
for the verities of the Thatcherite revolution.
He was scathing of New Labour, claiming that Mr Blair's contradiction
between aspiration and reality provoked intense anger in him.
''Anger at the ruination it would inflict upon the Scottish people,
anger at the irresponsibility and hypocrisy of Labour, real anger -- not
Mr Blair's carefully rehearsed Islington ire for the benefit of the
television cameras.''
In a wide ranging speech, perhaps more suited to the main conference
platform than to the fringe meeting at which he delivered it, Mr Forsyth
accused Labour of hypocrisy in wrapping itself in the Union Flag while
promising a Scottish parliament which would end that Union.
''Labour's tired and chaotic scheme for Scottish devolution -- false
devolution of power to a clique of politicians instead of directly to
the Scottish people -- is worse than wrong- headed,'' said Mr Forsyth.
''We in Britain are more fortunate than we know. We have inherited the
oldest and most stable consitution in Europe. We have no boundary
disputes such as those which plague land-locked countries -- the sea is
our timeless frontier.
''In 1603 at the Union of the Crowns, Scotland executed one of the
most spectacular takeovers in history when our monarchy inherited the
English throne. Since 1707, by sovereign treaty, the Union of the
Parliaments has made us free and equal partners in the United Kingdom.''
He said Scotland remained a nation in its own right, neither superior
nor inferior, and we should be well content. The majority were, he
insisted, pointing out that in the 1979 referendum two-thirds either
passively or actively supported the status quo, while at the last
General Election 75% of the electorate voted for Unionist parties.
He claimed that a Scottish leftist political establishment were happy
to fleece their countrymen ''to support their vanity and their desire to
subject Scotland to their third world ideology.''
Attacking the plans of devolutionists and separatists, he
continued''Our feeble patronage parliament would put at risk the funding
of our hospitals, schools, and other essential services,'' he said,
adding that Labour policies were mischievously divisive. ''To shred the
seemless garment of our constitution, painfully constructed over
hundreds of years, is a work of anarchy. Mr Blair talks of unity but his
mentality is crudely partisan.''
Citing the spirit of the Second World War, Mr Forsyth said: ''There
was no chattering about democratic deficits or English exploitation in
those brave, desperate days. When the bombs rained indiscriminately on
Clydebank and on Coventry, we knew we were one nation.''
Mr Forsyth flagged up his address as a blueprint for British
devolution -- a plan not for a Scottish parliament but for the
redistribution of power down from all Government and legislative elites.
He said that the Conservatives were looking at a radical and
comprehensive reshaping of society -- not tinkering with peripheral
structures, not tokenism. ''What is required in Scotland is nothing less
than a massive abdication of power by Government -- that means
Government at every level.''
The beneficiaries, he said, would be small communities in which people
lived in the real world, as distinct from the so-called corridors of
power. ''Beyond even small units such as community councils power must
flow like a charge of energy into neighbourhoods, streets and private
households. The ultimate unit of devolution is the individual.''
That struck a conscious echo with the rallying call of the- then Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher when she said there was no such thing as
society. While playing a populist card of consultation and empowerment,
Mr Forsyth was holding true to his No Turning Back credentials.
He carried through his well-flagged condemnation of the excesses of
Labour controlled local authorities in Scotland and he also suggested
that he would be pressing on with the suggestion put by STUC general
secretary Campbell Christie for the strengthening of the Scottish
Economic Council.

Conference Round-up
THE outspoken views of a 14-year-old boy may have proved too explosive
for the Conservative conference.
Right-winger Justin Hinchcliffe, from north London, who was to have
made a barnstorming debut during the education debate disappointed his
followers by not taking the rostrum.
He told TV reporters the reason was he had a sore throat, but there is
speculation his views were too controversial.
His supporters refused to comment on reports that he had been gagged.
On Tuesday, he was keen to give his views on the need for more
hospital closures, and a crackdown on social security payments.
TORY supporters in Blackpool are not backing their buoyant rhetoric
with money. Bookmakers William Hill, despite having 18 shops in the
town, say they have failed this week to take a single bet nationwide of
#50 or more on the party to win the election. William Hill make Labour
1/3 favourites to win most seats at the next General Election, Tories
2/1 and Liberal Democrats 100/1.
THE conference last night urged the abolition of council tax capping
-- but was rebuffed by the Government. On a show of hands,
representatives in Blackpool overwhelmingly backed a motion which, in
part, called for the move -- consistently opposed by Ministers. Local
Government Minister David Curry later insisted that the conference
decision would not alter the Government's policy.

NEWS at Ten broadcaster Trevor McDonald will head the Government's
campaign to promote the use of correct English -- or Aberdeen English --
Education Secretary Gillian Shephard announced yesterday.
Too many young people applying for jobs were unable to communicate,
she said. The campaign was intended to ensure ''that they can speak
clearly and comprehensibly, not communicate by grunt''.
Among those guilty of uncouth speaking, she suggested after her speech
to Tory representatives, were some of her fellow English MPs: ''It has
to be said that some of my Scottish parliamentary colleagues are more
comprehensible than others. That's because the Scottish education system
is first class, including the teaching of English.''
The best English was found not in the Home Counties of England, but in
Aberdeen. ''The clearest English, the most correct English is that
spoken by the people living and around Aberdeen,'' she said.
A group made up of personalities from the media, business,
broadcasting, and sport, and headed by Mr MacDonald, will encourage the
use of good English.
The broadcaster was not available for comment but a close source said
he viewed the task as one of great importance.
The source said: ''This is something he is very interested in. He
thinks it's a great idea and a very important idea.
McDonald, 56, is renowned for the clarity and richness of his
language, learned in the English-steeped atmosphere of Trinidad, where
his parents saw good use of words as a vital part of his upbringing.
He told an interviewer earlier this year: ''We had to speak properly
and I had elocution lessons from my mother. We had to learn new words
every day and use them.''
Mrs Shephard also named two other members of the group as City of
Chester Tory MP Gyles Brandreth, who is also a writer and broadcaster,
and Sir David English, chairman of Associated Newspapers.
Mrs Shephard unveiled a number of initiatives for the English and
Welsh education systems, including professional qualifications for head
teachers, and separate grades for spoken English on GCSEs, the English
version of standards.
However, all the reforms she proposed are already in effect in
Scotland. Spoken English is assessed as part of the five to 14
programme, and a management scheme for head teachers was established in
1990.

A JUDGE yesterday gave the go-ahead for the distribution of an
unauthorised biography of Scottish chart-topping group Wet Wet Wet,
which uses the group's name on the cover.
Lord McCluskey's ruling was welcomed by Edinburgh publishers
Mainstream, which had to shelve 10,000 copies of the book following an
earlier court order granted to London-based merchandising firm, Bravado.
Mainstream feared the loss of potential profits of #300,000.
Bravado, the registered owner of the trademark Wet Wet Wet, objected
to the name featuring so prominently on the cover, particularly as it
also has a book about the group about to be published.
Mainstream's book, A Sweet Little Mystery -- Wet Wet Wet -- The Inside
Story, has been written by Evening Times journalist Brian Beacom, and
Bravado argued that as registered owners of the trademark its rights
were being infringed.
At a hearing in the Court of Session, Bravado's counsel, Mr Calum
MacNeill, made it clear that the court action had nothing to do with the
contents of the book, which were not an infringement of the trademark.
The case was concerned solely with the use of the Wet Wet Wet name.
He asked Lord McCluskey for a permanent interdict against the sale of
the book with the Wet Wet Wet title on the cover.
Mr Ronald Mackay, QC, for Mainstream, argued that the name was being
used on the cover only to describe the contents of the book to the
public, and denied any infringement of the trademark.
Issuing a written decision in the case yesterday, Lord McCluskey
described Wet Wet Wet as a popular group of musicians with a worldwide
following.
The dust cover of the book had a picture of members of the group and
above the photograph the words A Sweet Little Mystery -- Wet Wet Wet --
The Inside Story.
The judge said resolution of the issues which arose in the case
depended on the meaning and application of the Trade Marks Act 1994.
There were distinctions between the use of words in a trade-mark sense
and in a non-trade sense.
''Plainly, the word ''wet'' is an ordinary word with well understood
meanings and it may be used in a non-trade mark sense. In ordinary
language, it might also be used repetitively without that use being in a
trade-mark sense.''
In the present case, however, the repeated reference to the word
''Wet'' had nothing to do with moisture or political timidity. It was an
obvious use of the name which the group had registered.
The court's first task was to decide, as a matter of fact, if the use
which was challenged was use in a trade mark or non-trade mark sense.
It seemed to him that the trade mark consisted in the three words Wet
Wet Wet, and that the use by Mainstream of identical words in the title
to the book and on the dust cover would be an infringement of Bravado's
registered trade mark.
However, under section 11 of the 1994 Act, a trade mark might be used
in certain circumstances without being regarded as an infringement and
the judge took the view that, in this case, Mainstream's use of the
registered trade mark Wet Wet Wet was protected by the Act.
The publishers were using the name to indicate to anyone who saw the
book that it was about the group.
The judge added: ''It would be a bizarre result of the trade marks
legislation, the primary purpose of which is to guarantee the trade mark
as an indication of origin, if it could be used to prevent publishers
from using the protected name in the title of a book about the company
or product.
''If that had been the intention of Parliament, I should have expected
it to be made plain. Section 11 was designed to avoid the risk that
trade- mark law might be used too restrictively.
''I conclude that, in the circumstances of this case, section 11
applies and has the effect that the use intended by Mainstream will not
infringe the registered trade mark of Bravado.''
The decision was relayed to Mainstream directors Mr Bill Campbell and
Mr Peter MacKenzie in Frankfurt, where they are attending the
international book festival, writes Alan Hunter.
They said it was a victory for common sense and principle.
The book, they insisted, in no way pretended to be an authorised
biography of the band, although its members and management were closely
consulted throughout writing and production.
Mr Campbell said: ''Why they felt the need to act as they did will, in
all probability, remain a sweet little mystery.''
Expressing his relief and delight, Mr Beacom said: ''What this means
is that authors have been given the right to write. Clearly it is
fantastic, because after spending two years writing a book about a pop
band the last thing you expect is to have the book banned, unless, of
course, the book is libellous.
''Lord McCluskey has clearly recognised that writers should be allowed
to write about whatever commercial organisation they choose.''
A statement issued by London-based solicitors Clare Elliot, Hart,
Smith &amp; Company, on behalf of Bravado, the group's merchandising
company, clearly indicated that the group was unhappy with Lord
McCluskey's decision.
The group's solicitors are currently taking senior counsel's advice
before deciding whether to lodge an appeal within the statutory 21 days.

MORE than 200 jobs are to be created in Central Scotland by
Northamptonshire-based Booker Belmont Wholesale, part of Booker plc.
The food group, which delivers to cash and carry outlets, is
developing a regional distribution centre at Livingston, West Lothian.
It is due to open in the first half of next year and, with three similar
centres in the south, represents a #95m investment by the company.
The company's existing distribution warehouse at South Gyle in
Edinburgh will close when the new facility opens but it is hoped most of
the 30 employees will choose to transfer to Livingston.

SHELL could yet recommend to the Government that deep water disposal
is the best practical environmental option for Brent Spar.
The company yesterday embarked on the costly process of extricating
itself from this summer's fiasco, which saw its controversial plans to
sink the giant oil storage installation in the North Sea thwarted.
The redundant 14,500 tonnes buoy has been anchored in a Norwegian
fjord since Shell UK Exploration and Production bowed to public opinion
in June. The decision has already cost more than #10m, a loss which will
rise because it could be more than a year before an acceptable strategy
is agreed.
If ending up where it started is the outcome of a consulation exercise
launched yesterday, Shell UK will hope to have convinced all concerned
that dumping is the best option. It would have to reapply for a licence
from the Scottish Office. The existing one expires on November 8.
Shell maintained it had an open mind yesterday when it revealed that
it would be inviting tenders for the disposal or re-use of Brent Spar.
Options will be whittled down to six, ''along with the currently
licensed deep sea disposal plan''.
From these seven options, a choice would be made which would balance
environmental, safety, health, technological, and economic
considerations along with ''widespread acceptability'', the company said
yesterday. Its fuel was boycotted at the height of the dumping row.
The company repeatedly refuses to rule out the controversial deep sea
dumping option, which was abandoned in June after a high-profile protest
campaign by the environmental group, Greenpeace.
Mr Eric Faulds, manager of the Brent Spar decommissioning project,
said Shell would take any new proposals, assess them in comparison with
the deep sea disposal plan, and consult widely.
Shell said it had decided to consider proposals from contractors and
individuals after receiving more than 200 unsolicited ideas from various
parties to date, from 25 different countries.
These included dismantling the rig at sea, either vertically or
horizontally, by cutting it into pieces and shipping it ashore, or
''rig-to-reef'' disposal, which would involve cleaning the Spar's
storage tanks biologically before dumping it at sea.
According to Mr Faulds, there was one terse offer to ''take Brent Spar
off your hands for #50m'' and another suggesting it be used as a
floating casino. Neither was given much consideration but overall the
200 contributions had encouraged Shell UK to devise a process which
would enable it to tap such ingenuity to the full.
Mr Faulds said: ''The Spar is a highly unusual, arguably unique
installation and its disposal is a challenge for Shell, the industry,
and society. We are convinced there is a way forward and we have taken a
very important step on that journey today.''

ROMAN Catholic bishops in Ireland have decided to report all serious
allegations of child sexual abuse by priests to the police and the
health authorities.
However, they will do so only after a bishop or religious superior is
advised by an expert committee that there is a reasonable suspicion that
the accused priest should be referred to the civil authorities for
investigation.
This procedure will form one of seven principles in a code of practice
that was adopted by the bishops at the end of a three-day meeting.
The church has been rocked by an avalanche of child sex abuse cases
involving clergy. Last week, it was revealed that one Dublin priest paid
an out-of- court settlement of #50,000 and another secured a loan from
the diocese for #35,000 to pay off a former altar boy.
Offering a humble apology on behalf of the Roman Catholic Church to
the victims of clerical sex abuse, Cardinal Cahal Daly announced last
night that the new code of practice comes into effect at once.
It will be the official policy of all 26 diocese in both Northern
Ireland and the Irish Republic, he explained.
The cardinal was adamant that, in future, the church would give no
cover to suspected paedophiles. Nor would paedophile priests be allowed
to be a risk to children.
Although the guidelines stress that the primary concern is the care
and protection of children, it balances this with the possibility of
false allegations being made against innocent priests. One bishop told
his colleagues that in recent weeks he received a letter containing
allegations against one of his priests which he discovered was a
forgery.

A DISQUALIFIED driver who led police on an 85-mile chase at speeds of
more than 100mph was jailed for six months yesterday.
Police chased Alan Calcott, who was driving a hired Ford Escort, from
Fort William to just north of Callander, Perthshire, where they rolled
out a ''Stinger'' -- a device like a bed of nails -- to stop him.
Sheriff William Reid told Calcott, 24, that he had put the public in
grave danger. He told him jail was inevitable. ''You treated the road
like a race track,'' he said.
In addition, Sheriff Reid banned Calcott from driving for a further
four years.
Stirling Sheriff Court heard that even after Calcott hit the Stinger
on Annie's Straight, on the A84 just north of Callander, he did not stop
at once, trying to drive on his rapidly deflating tyres.
Then he lost control, spun off, and tried to run away before being
apprehended by police officers, said depute-fiscal Lorraine Glancy.
Calcott, of Main Street, Lennoxtown, Stirlingshire, admitted dangerous
driving and being found in possession of a small amount of cannabis
resin when arrested.
He also admitted giving a false name to police in an attempt to
pervert the course of justice, driving in defiance of a 12-month ban,
and having no insurance.
Defence agent John Barr said his client had simply lost his head when
he was signalled to stop and decided to see if he could outrun the
police.

THE Government has been asked by Strathclyde region to define the role
of social workers in child abuse investigations following widespread
criticism in the Orkney and Ayrshire cases.
Senior social workers in Strathclyde made it clear yesterday that they
would prefer to provide support and care for families rather than front
a criminal investigation for which they were not trained.
They were concerned that families in these difficult circumstances
were wary of seeking social work support for fear of being investigated.
The director of social work, Ms Mary Hartnoll, complained that such
investigations had moved social work away from its traditional roles of
prevention, crisis support, and care.
Ms Hartnoll was updating Strathclyde's social work committee on the
return of the children in the Ayrshire cases to their parents, and on
discussions with the Scottish Office regarding draft guidance on
investigative interviewing.
She pointed out that even if a small number of trained social work
staff were to be used in investigative interviewing, there could be no
certainty about proving whether or not abuse had occurred.
''It may therefore be preferable in most cases to emphasise the
supportive role of social work while remaining alert to suspicions of
abuse rather than proceeding too quickly to a formal investigation,''
she said.
The deputy director of social work (child care), Mr Ian Gilmour,
explained: ''Lord Clyde in his Orkney Report said the role of social
work was not to investigate. He said social work staff were not equipped
or trained to undertake investigations.''

SOCCER stars John Fashanu, Bruce Grobbelaar, and Hans Segers appeared
in court yesterday accused of taking part in a plot to rig the results
of two Liverpool football matches.
The three players and their co-accused, Malaysian businessman Heng
Suan Lim, 30, were making first appearance in Southampton Magistrates'
Court but spoke only to give their name, age, and address.
All four were remanded on conditional bail until December 1.
All four are charged with conspiring between February 1, 1991 and
March 15, 1995 ''with others known and unknown, corruptly to give and
corruptly to accept gifts of money as inducements improperly to
influence the outcome of football matches or as rewards for having so
done''.
All four were bailed on condition that they did not contact
prosecution witnesses Mr Christopher Vincent or Mr John Troup, the Sun
journalist who first reported the allegations.
Fashanu's wife, Ms Melissa Kassa-Mapsi, 29, was originally arrested
and charged with the four men but the Crown Prosecution Service
yesterday said it was discontinuing the case against her.
She said: ''I'm so pleased. We have never understood why any of us
should have been caught up in the case. The news comes as great relief.
Now I want to start living a normal life again.''
After the case, Grobbelaar's solicitor Mr David Hewitt said: ''We were
concerned this morning when we saw on television the report that
additional charges were bring preferred. That is not the case. There
have been no additional charges against the defendant.''

I want to get justice for the girls who didn't make it, because I feel
it was my fault
Caroline Owens
A WOMAN who was abducted and sexually assaulted by Frederick and
Rosemary West broke down in the witness box yesterday and blamed herself
for the killings at 25 Cromwell Street, Gloucester.
''I want to get justice for the girls who didn't make it, because I
feel it was my fault,'' 39-year-old Caroline Owens blurted out before
she collapsed in tears.
She was assisted out of court by an usher.
In the dock, Mrs Rosemary West, who denies 10 counts of murdering
young women and girls, remained impassive.
Mrs Owens's breakdown came as she was asked a final question in
re-examination by Mr Brian Levenson, QC, prosecuting. He simply asked
why she had come to court.
During heavy cross examination it had been alleged Mrs Owens had
embellished her story to make it more marketable for newspapers. It was
an allegation she denied.
The jury had previously heard from a statement Mrs Owens had made to
police that she was blaming herself for the deaths.
In the statement, read out by Mr Richard Ferguson QC, defending, Mrs
Owens made it clear she believed that if she had pressed a rape charge
against Mr West in 1973, they might not have happened.
''When I became aware of the women that had been murdered and the
alleged involvement of Fred and Rose West, in 1994, I felt anger,
frustration, guilt . . . I felt that if I had gone to court on my rape
case, I could have stopped it,'' Mrs Owens said in the police statement
made last October.
Both Rosemary and Frederick West did plead guilty to charges of
causing actual bodily harm and sexual assault on Mrs Owens, the jury has
been told.
They were each fined #50.
Yesterday Mrs Owens said that after she was sexually assaulted by the
couple in 1972 -- an ordeal which involved abduction, being bound, and
gagged -- police told her that while the Wests would plead guilty to the
lesser charges, Frederick West would deny rape.
''At the time I was told by police that I would be cross examined in
the witness box and that it would be hard to handle,'' Mrs Owens said in
her statement. ''I felt that I could not cope with this.''
As a consequence she elected not to pursue the rape charge in 1973.
In her police statement, Mrs Owens described how she had been mentally
scarred by her experiences.
''After the abduction and rape in 1972, I was very depressed and had
low self esteem,'' she said in her statement. She was prescribed Librium
tablets by her family doctor and other mild tranquilisers by another
doctor.
She said she took an overdose in 1976 when she was working in a hotel
at Weston-super-Mare. An ambulance was called and she was rushed to
hospital.
''My stomach was pumped out,'' the statement continued.
Mrs Owens told police that she was receiving counselling for the
trauma. Thus far she had had 14 sessions.
''I have been very sensitive to people being close to me and cuddling
me since being abducted by Fred and Rose'' she told police. ''I am wary
of other adult females, even friends.
''I have a terrible feeling of worthlessness.''
The statement also detailed her sex life during the few weeks she had
stayed at 25 Cromwell Street, weeks before the Wests abducted and
assaulted her.
She described how late one evening she went into the room of Mr Ben
Stanniland, a lodger in the house.
''It was late at night, I don't remember if we were drinking or
smoking anything, but we could have,'' Mrs Owens statement declared. ''I
may have taken some drink that affected my judgment but I cannot clearly
remember the events of the evening.''
Mrs Owens admitted having had sexual intercourse with Mr Stanniland
and afterwards had sex with Mr Alan Davies, another lodger.
''This was a one off occasion,'' Mrs Owens continued in her statement.
''This was in the early seventies, the hippie era when people were
generally very friendly.''
Her boyfriend at the time, Mr Tony Coates, would also come and stay
for a night with her at Cromwell Street.
The only other male visitor she had sex with at that address was an
old boyfriend who visited her there, the day before her birthday.
Mrs Owens told the court that she had been promised #20,000 from the
Sun newspaper for her exclusive story. She had already received #9500 of
that sum, she told Mr Ferguson.
Mrs Owens described how after the assault by the Wests she failed to
report immediately the rape to the police.
''It was what Mrs West did,'' she said. ''I hadn't come across
anything like this before and it shocked me.
''When Fred raped me it was all over in a couple of seconds.''
Initially she had wanted the rape charge pursued, but afterwards could
not face the thought of going to court.
At the time she was not quite 17 years of age.
Twenty years on she saw television reports of the police investigation
at 25 Cromwell Street. After her initial shock she contacted the police.
Before being interviewed last year she had written down her memories
of the 1972 attack. She did this because she felt she would be too
embarrassed to go into details with the officers.
Mrs Owens had told the court that the account she had prepared for
police of the assault was shown to a Sun journalist, but a page
containing details was withheld.
''You were using it to bargain with -- to up the price, so you would
get more money,'' said Mr Ferguson.
''In a way,'' said the witness. She also said she had received other
sums of money from the media.
A diary she had kept in 1973 showed that she continued her practice of
hitch hiking, even after the assault.
''I knew the police had been to them and they would not try to pick me
up again,'' she said. ''I've never had any problems hitch hiking
before.''
In re-examination Mrs Owens said that during the attack Mrs West had
done nothing which suggested she was not acting willingly, nor had she
done anything to prevent her husband from assaulting her.
Defence counsel had suggested Mr West got out of control that night,
Mr Levenson said. Mrs Owens said on the contrary he seemed quite calm.
Asked how Mrs West appeared, the witness said: ''She was grinning and
laughing. She looked evil to me''
Another witness, the mother of one of the girls whose remains were
recovered from 25 Cromwell Street, described how she shuddered when she
passed the murder house while out searching for her missing daughter.
''I shuddered, I don't know why I shuddered,'' said Mrs June Gough,
mother of Lynda Gough, who disappeared in 1973, aged 19.
Mrs Gough described how two weeks after her daughter had left home her
inquiries took her to Cromwell Street where the door was answered by a
woman wearing Lynda's slippers.
She also saw some of her daughter's clothing on a washing line. The
woman insisted, however, that Lynda was not there and had gone to live
in Weston-super-Mare.
Mrs Gough said Lynda was the eldest of three children.
Before going to work as a seamstress with the Co-operative in
Gloucester she had attended a private school in Midland Road.
The jury has been told that the Wests had at one time lived in a flat
in that road and it is alleged that the body of eight-year-old Charmaine
West, who was born in Coatbridge, was buried there.
Mrs Gough said her daughter was a cheerful, happy, friendly girl, who
was not withdrawn and did not isolate herself.
She seemed to get on with most people quite easily.
As she got older, around 18, she began to become quite rebellious.
''Like a lot of teenagers in those days as well as today,'' said Mrs
Gough.
Lynda left home on Thursday April 19, 1973. ''It is something that has
always stayed in my mind,'' said Mrs Gough. ''It is not something I am
ever likely to forget.''
Her daughter had left a note saying that she had found a flat and had
moved. She had taken all her possessions with her.
''Please don't worry about me,'' the note declared.
Two weeks previously Lynda had said she was going out in the evening
with some friends for a drink. Afterwards a woman arrived at the door to
collect her.
The Crown allege that this was Mrs West.
Lynda had indicated in her note that she would be in touch with her
parents.
However, they became worried when they did not hear from her. They did
not think she was earning enough to keep herself in a flat.
The parents had assumed she would not stay away long. She would soon
be back when the money ran out.
''I was just anxious,'' said Mrs Gough. ''I wanted to know where she
was, where she was living, whether she was happy'' she told the court.
Her inquiries took her to 25 Cromwell Street. There she was met by the
same woman who had called two weeks before to take Lynda for a drink.
She was joined by her husband at the door.
All they would say was that she had gone to Weston-super-Mare and had
left some of her belongings behind.
She continued her inquiries in Gloucester and in Weston-super-Mare.
However, Mrs Gough said she never saw her daughter again.
The crown allege that she was buried under the floor of a bathroom in
Cromwell Street when her mother was at the door.
She had passed the address at Cromwell Street on several occasions.
However, after feeling the shudder she never went back.

OPINION
DUNCAN Ferguson was not alone in the dock yesterday. Football stood by
his side and was found to be culpable also.
The people's game was guilty of having let down the masses by having
created an environment in which violent play was becoming acceptable
and, when Lord Hope dismissed the Everton striker's appeal against a
three-month jail sentence, the entire sport should have recoiled, if not
exactly in horror then certainly in fright.
In refusing to interfere with the sentence imposed in Glasgow last May
after Ferguson had been found guilty of head-butting fellow footballer
John McStay, then of Raith Rovers, the country's most senior judge made
it clear football players were not immune to the laws of the land.
Stepping inside the white lines of a football pitch does not grant
immunity and players no longer can be considered safe from the courts.
If the game wishes to avoid further interference from the outside, it
must examine carefully its image and the type of temperaments it has
been encouraging as well as fostering all these decades. Instead of
hanging a collective head in despair, the game should take this
opportunity to rid itself of the misguided who use the garb of the
footballer as a thin disguise behind which to practice what sometimes is
not far short of hooliganism.
While Ferguson was as much a victim yesterday of an unlawful past,
Lord Hope made it clear criminal acts in sport will not be tolerated,
but that doesn't mean footballers at play during the weekend will find
themselves locked up until Monday morning if they suffer rushes of blood
to their heads. There will always be spontaneous violence in contact
sports and it would not be in anyone's interest to jail every
sportsperson who oversteps the mark.
Nevertheless, a greater onus has now been placed on everyone within
football and other sports in which physical endeavour is a major part of
the spectacle to become more reasonable human beings. Footballers don't
need to refrain from tackling but they can't lunge in wildly. Also, they
have to accept a greater share of responsibility and make sure they
project the correct images.
Most players and supporters would agree football has not become much
more violent than it ever was but today's professionals are living in
the age of rapidly advancing technology. Incidents which would have gone
unnoticed in the past are now captured by the sophistication of
broadcasters and an act which might before have been no more than a pub
argument among those fans who were at the match becomes a national
debate.
This exposure of the game's darker side is one of the prices football
must pay for accepting the millions of pounds thrown at it by television
companies.
The main performers, from players to managers and directors, were
registering astonishment and anger at the severity of Ferguson's
sentence but if they all wish to be totally frank, they would admit they
have had it coming for a long time.
Occasionally in the past the courts have issued threats and taken
action against footballers behaving badly but the signals never
registered.
Athletes have been taken from sport to court in the past and indeed
there was the now infamous incident during an Old Firm game in October
of 1987 when a few players found themselves in the dock after a brawl.
Ian Durrant was willing to take his case to court after a tackle by
former Aberdeen player Neil Simpson had threatened the Rangers player's
career, and there have been other cases in which footballers and rugby
players were hauled before judges.
Perhaps the disappearance of Ferguson to do some time will be enough
to drive the warning home forcibly enough this time.
It would certainly be foolish of anyone to believe the 23-year-old was
punished simply because he had a crime sheet. The simple fact is the
courts will make sure the same laws by which we must abide on the
streets have to be enforced in sport also and that is no more than just.
It is also overdue.
Football, indeed no sport, can be above the law and it has always been
a ridiculous system which allowed fans to be dragged away for violent or
unruly behaviour while the highly-paid professionals were getting away
with no more than match suspensions for having committed similar
offences. Players should realise they have to set examples because they
are regarded as heroes and become role models of the very young.
Undoubtedly managers have a massive responsibility because footballers
respond to their instructions and appeals and, when robust, cynical play
is privately endorsed, the wrong climate is created.
Ferguson was scheduled to have made his comeback after injury in an
Everton reserve match on Saturday but he will be otherwise engaged now.
It may seem harsh given the leniency shown by the English legal system
to the likes of Eric Cantona but Ferguson had already been treated
lightly, having been placed on probation after a previous incident.
He was not entirely an innocent and should have been aware of the
risks and when he returns to the game he will be more careful. By then
hopefully the game will have examined itself and its responsibilities,
too.

THERE will be no car ferry to run in direct competition with the Skye
bridge when it opens on Monday, but campaigners insisted yesterday that
their search for a suitable vessel would continue.
The Skye Boat Company had intended to have a vessel ready to begin
running when the final Caledonian MacBrayne ferry runs between Kyle of
Lochalsh and Kyleakin on Monday afternoon. Efforts in the UK and abroad
to secure a vessel suitable for carrying cars have so far proved
fruitless, as Mr Peter Findlay, a director of the boat company, admitted
yesterday.
Mr Findlay added: ''We certainly have not given up the idea. We
believe it is vital that we provide a ferry alternative to the bridge,
which is an expensive monopoly that is being imposed upon us.''
The announcement that the Railways Users' Consultative Committee for
Scotland is to hold an informal public meeting in Kyle of Lochalsh to
hear public representations on the withdrawal of the ferry service on
October 27 has not placated campaigners.
Mrs Kathleen MacRae, treasurer of the Skye Bridge Appeal Group, said
yesterday. ''It is nothing more than a PR exercise.''
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth's comments at the Tory conference,
when he said the Skye bridge was an example of private finance being
successfully involved in such major projects, and the view of delegates
was that the toll bridge was popular, were attacked by Ross, Cromarty
and Skye MP Charles Kennedy.
''These remarks show that the Tories are on a different planet to the
rest of us,'' said Mr Kennedy. ''Far from being popular, these Skye-high
tolls are causing huge resentment locally, and have led to the boycott
of the opening by Western Isles MP Calum Macdonald and myself as well as
the entire Skye and Lochalsh District Council.''

AS a prison van took Duncan Ferguson to Barlinnie, the Scottish
Football Association confirmed it would now pursue the 12-game ban for
his violent conduct which was put on hold pending yesterday's court
hearing.
Further acrimonious exchanges involving his club Everton, the SFA, the
Scottish Professional Footballers' Association, and solicitors
representing the player are now guaranteed.
Everton chairman Peter Johnson emphasised an appeal against the match
ban has not been ruled out.
Manager Joe Royle said all at the club ''were stunned''.
Mr Alex Smith, chairman of the Managers and Coaches' Association, said
the imprisonment opened ''a frightening scenario for football''.
Mr Tony Higgins, secretary of the Scottish footballers' union, said he
believed the crime did not fit the punishment. He suggested a
Cantona-style, non-custodial sentence would have been more appropriate,
a reference to Manchester United's Eric Cantona and the community
service he received for a Kung Fu-type attack on a supporter.
He warned there would now be no hiding place for contact sports
because sophisticated cameras cover more than the play. He said it was a
matter of concern that TV evidence could be used to help convict
footballers but not to clear them.
The union's arguments at an appeal against the ban will include the
player ''having suffered enough''.
Ferguson is the first British international footballer to be jailed
for assaulting a fellow professional on the field of play.
The SFA will contact both player and club to find out if he is
continuing to appeal the ban, so that a date for a personal appearance
could be fixed on his release.
SFA secretary Jim Farry declined to comment on the judges' decision.
He did say the SFA view on conduct was that all involved in football,
from directors and players to supporters, have an over-riding
responsibility to set the right example.
He said footballers may be role models for others and added: ''They
must bear this onerous burden in mind both on and off the field.''
Ferguson's solicitor, Mr Blair Morgan, said: ''I spoke to Duncan
afterwards. He did not say very much. He had expected this to happen. He
had expected the worst and I think that was probably a very good
preparation.''
Mr Morgan said there was no question of the match ban taking place
while Ferguson served his sentence. He stressed the ban would be
discussed only after Ferguson's release because he would have to be
present at an appeal.
The player accepted he should never have behaved in the way he did and
bitterly regretted it.
Rangers' vice-chairman, Mr Donald Findlay QC, said: ''I am very
disappointed from his point of view. It's very sad to see any young man
going to prison.''
Mr Royle said: ''We are all amazed and stunned and can't really
believe, in a society that seems dedicated to keeping people out of
prison, that we are putting a young man, who is in a good job and is no
danger to society, away.''
He went on: ''I just find it incredible. I think both the Scottish FA
and the Scottish law courts have set a precedent for themselves which
will be closely looked at in the future.
''Anyone who knows him will tell you he is a very pleasant young man.
He is not a bad lad at all. He has been guilty sometimes of stupidity
but mostly immaturity.
''We all see events on football pitches every week and they are a lot
worse than what Duncan now finds himself imprisoned with hardened
criminals for.''
Mr Royle said that when Ferguson was signed, the club was aware of the
case, but had been advised there was ''little or no chance of it coming
to this''.
He predicted Ferguson woud remain an Everton hero.
Mr Johnson criticised the sentence: ''I am very, very disappointed
that a young man who has a job, that is no danger to society, has been
sent to prison for something that went on on a football pitch and at the
time didn't attract any attention whatever.''
He thought there were more appropriate sentences.
Mr Higgins said he did not condone violence but thought the Scottish
court was at variance with justice in England, where it was felt a
custodial sentence for Cantona was not justified.
Mr Higgins argued it was well documented that acts more grevious than
Ferguson's have taken place in football and sport in general.
He added that the SPFA would prefer on-field incidents to be dealt
with by the football authorities but thought these days were over.
''From now on, it is obvious the procurator-fiscals' service will
become heavily involved in sport. There will be no hiding place but
there will be anomalies because not every game is covered by
television.''
The other player involved, John McStay, who now plays for East Fife,
was not commenting on the decision.
A Central Scotland Police spokesman said: ''Ferguson is the classic
case of 'local boy does well' but that has its downside as well. He was
never far from trouble when he lived here and when he visited home. It
could be either down to his own personality or just sheer jealousy from
rivals in the town -- we'll probably never know.''

THE Government is to be put in the dock again in Europe over the
killing of IRA members by the security forces, a justice group said last
night.
Just weeks after Britain was found to have denied the right to life of
the three IRA members shot dead by the SAS in Gibraltar, another case
involving the SAS is being taken to Europe.
This time it is the shooting of eight IRA men as they launched a gun
and bomb attack on an RUC station in Loughgall, County Armagh, in 1987
that will be under the European spotlight.
The Committee on the Administration of Justice said last night it had
lodged an application with the European Commission on Human Rights this
week at the request of the families of nine men killed in Loughgall --
the IRA men and a civilian who was killed in the crossfire.
The CAJ said the application asserted that the right to life, as
guaranteed by Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights, was
''violated by the State in the planning, control, and execution of the
operation and in the failure to provide an effective investigation into
the incident''.
In the Gibraltar case, Britain was found guilty of a breach of Article
2.
CAJ spokesman Mr Paul Mageean said: ''The security forces have a duty
in all circumstances to preserve life rather than to take it. We are
concerned that, at Loughgall, they fell short of this standard.''
The European Commission on Human Rights found in Britain's favour in
the Gibraltar case by a majority decision but its verdict was overturned
-- again by a majority vote -- by the European Court on Human Rights.

THE jury of eight men and four women at Winchester Crown Court
yesterday heard a statement which contradicted evidence given to the
court on Tuesday, writes James McKillop.
Crown witness Elizabeth Agius, had insisted in her evidence that she
had never had sex with Frederick West, nor been involved in a
three-in-a-bed session with him and his wife Rosemary.
Yesterday, a witness statement was read from a Mr Gerard Watters, a
police officer, which described how he had interviewed Mrs Agius in
connection with the Cromwell Street murder investigation.
The officer said he had been told by Mrs Agius that on an occasion
when she visited the Wests, her one-time neighbours, at 25 Midland Road,
Gloucester, for a cup of tea, she felt drowsy and began to feel strange.
She awoke naked in bed with Rosemary and Frederick West, who were also
nude.
Mr West told her that he had had full sexual intercourse with her when
she was unconscious.
In his statement, the officer said that Mrs Agius accepted that if Mr
West said he had, then he probably had.
Even the next day she felt strange and did not know what had been
given to her in the tea. She had never told anyone about this before and
if her husband found out he would leave her.
If it was raised in court, Mrs Agius said she would deny it. The
officer said he felt embarrassed at betraying a confidence given to him
by her.

TORY defector Alan Howarth yesterday caused further problems for the
Tory leadership by once again predicting that more Conservative MPs
could follow his lead after what he described as a ''lurch to the
right'' by the party conference.
Mr Howarth has claimed that between 30 and 40 MPs share his views and
he said that events at Blackpool -- with strongly right-wing speeches
from Defence Secretary Michael Portillo and Tory party chairman Brian
Mawhinney -- had confirmed his worst fears about the direction in which
the party was moving.
At a Westminster photocall with his new leader, Mr Tony Blair, he
said: ''I talked to one MP this morning who was deeply shocked by what
he had seen and heard in Blackpool.
''I don't doubt there are a considerable number of my former
colleagues on the Tory benches who are thinking very deeply indeed.''
He claimed Prime Minister John Major was now a prisoner of the Tory
right.
Mr Howarth said: ''We saw Dr Mawhinney opening up with an attack on
local government and some unfortunate remarks about Asian minorities.
Then we saw Michael Portillo indulging in an extraordinary tirade of
anti-foreigner emotion.
''This retreat by the Tory party into narrow, aggressive insularity I
think will be catastrophic for the country. The great image I have is of
Mr Major sitting hunched and wan while Michael Portillo was doing his
great dictator bit beside him, appealing to the Redwood groupies to come
back and support him. The militant right in the Tory party is making all
the running.''
He brushed aside Dr Mawhinney's suggestion that his defection was
''much ado about nothing'', stating: ''It is much ado about something
very important. It is the defection of a great party from the principles
it used to hold.''
Mr Blair, still basking in Labour's propaganda coup, said the party
had already taken Mr Howarth to its heart, although he declined to say
whether the former Minister would be a Labour candidate at the next
election.
''I am sure, from the support he has already had, he is someone who
will be very carefully considered by the Labour Party for selection,''
Mr Blair said.
He also stepped up his attacks on the Tories, challenging Mr Major to
prove in his conference speech that he had not become a hostage of the
right.
Mr Howarth dismissed questions about press reports suggesting he had
decided to defect after meetings with the Labour peer Baroness Hollis.
''I think you degrade yourself by asking that question,'' he told one
journalist. ''I have many friends in the Labour Party and I have got
many more after this week.''

A COMPANY which produced a commercial video containing footage of
official executions from around the world, wants to screen real-life
violence on Scottish streets as television entertainment.
However, the approach from EduVision has been rejected by police
chiefs, including Strathclyde Chief Constable Leslie Sharp.
The English company, which was behind ITV's successful Police - Stop
series, showing roadside camera film of eccentric driving, has made
enquiries about buying footage from local authorities to screen on
television.
It also produced the controversial executions video that was passed by
the British Board of Film Classification as an 18 certificate, although
it was withdrawn from sale in some shops because of a public outcry.
Already, footage has been bought from English authorities which is
understood to show muggings and bizarre incidents caught on camera, but
Strathclyde Police has said there is no prospect of incidents anywhere
in Strathclyde reaching the small screen.
Police chiefs, who say their forces own the copyright on the films,
will block any move to show violence on Scottish streets.
A police spokesman said yesterday: ''The footage recorded by the
Citywatch scheme in Glasgow, and other schemes in Strathclyde, is the
property of the chief constable.
''Under no circumstances will this be sold for commercial gain.''
City centre cameras act as a deterrent and film recorded can be used
as evidence in court, all of which has helped bring down crime figures
in towns throughout the region.
Motherwell district chief planning officer Susan Cloke said: ''I don't
think any of the people involved in setting up the systems would approve
of things being sensationalised like this.''
No-one at Eduvision was available for comment yesterday.

PERMISSION to build the M74 motorway extension through the South Side
of Glasgow, completing the city's motorway box, was granted by Glasgow
City Council last night.
After a day-long planning sub-committee meeting hearing in the City
Halls, and a brief discussion in private, councillors voted 9-4 in
favour of the #250m road plan.
Work on the 4.8-mile road is due to begin in the year 2000, dependent
on Scottish Office funding. It will follow the line of the
Glasgow-to-London railway line skirting Rutherglen, Toryglen, and
Govanhill before joining the M8 at the southern side of the Kingston
Bridge.
The road's construction will involve the demolition of around 30 homes
and the relocation of 100 businesses.
Explaining the committee's decision, convener Ron Davie said
councillors had agreed with many of the points raised by the protesters.
However, he said the committee felt it was impossible to ignore the
benefits of the M74 to Glasgow.
''The committee was unanimous in thinking there should be improvements
in public transport but at the same time all we have is information in
front of us on a piece of road that will benefit Glasgow,'' he said.
The council's decision was greeted with dismay by roads protesters who
felt the hearing had been too rushed.
Mr David Spaven, of Glasgow for People, said the M74 proposal was one
of the biggest planning decisions the city had had to consider and
should have been given greater scrutiny. Ms Rosie Kane, a South Side
resident and member of the No M74 campaign, added that the hearing had
been a formality and claimed the council had already made its decision
before listening to the protesters.
However, Strathclyde region's roads and transportation chairman, Mr
Charles Gordon, said the council had taken a far-sighted decision. He
rebuffed any suggestion that there had been inadequate public
consultation. The plan had been included in the council's 1988 roads
stategy and regularly updated, he said.
The move was described by Glasgow Chamber of Commerce chief executive
Geoff Runcie as a bold decision in the absence of a clear Government
transport policy. He was speaking on behalf of a number of business
groups, including Scottish Enterprise, Glasgow Development Agency, and
the CBI.
During yesterday's meeting, councillors heard the case for the
motorway from its proposers, Strathclyde Regional Council, as well as
objections from 24 campaign groups and individuals.
Describing the plan as a dinosaur's egg from a council past the age of
childbearing, Rutherglen councillor Gretel Ross also voiced concerns
over the safety of chromium waste sites in the line of the motorway.
Fears were expressed by community councillors, Friends of the Earth, and
an assortment of other environmental action groups over pollution and
induced traffic flow.
One company, Keyline Builders Merchants, which has premises near the
route of the motorway predicted a loss of custom and 30 consequent job
losses as a result of the plan.
Mr Spaven said the #250m spent on the road could be spent on a whole
range of alternative traffic projects including electrifying 80 miles of
local railway line, electrifying the Glasgow to Edinburgh line, a new
railway to Glasgow airport, and bus and traffic calming measures in the
south-east of the city.
Outlining the case for the motorway, regional planning director
Michael Hayes said the M74 was a vital component in the economic
development of Glasgow. He said it would cut accidents by 11%, cut car
journey times by 10 minutes, and reduce the volume of traffic using
local roads.
The region's M74 project manager, Mr Jack Steele, admitted that a
three-lane section of the motorway would be congested by the year 2015.
However, he said congestion on Glasgow's other motorways had not seen
traffic return to neighbouring streets.
Objectors said they now intended to appeal to the Scottish Secretary,
Mr Michael Forsyth, for a full public inquiry into the issue.

FERTILITY clinics around Britain vary widely in their birth success
record, according to a controversial new patients' guide.
Figures for the percentage of fertility treatments which result in
live births range from zero to more than 40% in different centres.
The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority had to fend off
strong criticism for publishing the statistics, which, it was claimed,
could confuse and alarm patients.
But the authority, the fertility clinic regulatory body, denied
producing a performance league table and stressed birth rates at
individual centres could vary greatly from year to year.
The guide -- the first of its kind in Britain -- covers almost 100
private and NHS clinics licenced by the HFEA.
The information in the guide covers the period from April 1993 to the
end of March 1994. Besides birth rates, other figures show the number of
patients treated, multiple birth rates, and abandoned treatment cycles.
National figures from the HFEA show that in 1993 the average IVF live
birth rate was 14.2 per 100 cycles of treatment. The average for Donor
Insemination was 6.5%.
However, while many clinics had birth rates around about average,
there were huge differences between the least and most successful.
For instance, Bupa Hospital Norwich had an IVF birth rate record of 0%
and a Donor Insemination rate of 5.2%. At the other end of the scale,
the University of Bristol IVF Service had a figure for Donor
Insemination of 42.6%. Small clinics appeared on paper to do worse than
the larger ones.
Dr Robin Yates, the consultant in charge of the infertility unit at
Glasgow Royal Infirmary, said last night their success rate for one
cycle of treatment was 24%, comprising 16% where fresh embryos were used
and 8% where they were frozen, which account for half the total.
Over the course of three cycles the success, or take-home baby rate,
rises to 50%.
Professor Howard Jacobs, chairman of the British Fertility Society
which represents clinics, said ordinary people were bound to regard the
guide as a league table. ''It is an invitation for it to happen, and I
don't think patients will be helped by that.''

OPINIONS of local people around Duncan Ferguson's home turf of St
Ninian's, Stirling, remained as split and as vehement as those on any
football terrace.
One of Ferguson's three previous assault victims, Mr Paul Robertson
described the sentence as harsh. Mr Robertson, of St Ninian's, was
hobbling in crutches in a taxi queue when Ferguson attacked him. The
assault landed Ferguson in court with a #200 fine.
However, yesterday, he said: ''He doesn't deserved to go to jail. I
don't think you should be sent to prison unless you are really evil and
I don't think Duncan is. It sets a dangerous precedent and means players
will be scared to touch each other on the park.''
The father of Ferguson's former girlfriend, Miss Jolene Boyle,
described the sentence as ''a miscarriage of justice''. Mr Joe Boyle, a
builder from Bridge of Allan said his daughter, who works as a barmaid
had gone away for a few of days.
Yesterday, Ferguson's mother, Iris, and father, Duncan, were not
answering the door of their detached home in Glasgow Road, St Ninian's.
Other locals attacked the decision. ''Its scandalous,'' Mr Charles
Horsburgh, a neighbour of the Ferguson family, said. ''After what
Cantona got away with, it's unbelievable. There's worse things happen
every week in football, it's just that this game was televised. He is a
scapegoat because of who he is, yet he's just a young lad and everyone
likes to stick up for themself at that age.
Mr Walter Wells, 45, agreed. ''He's a nice lad but he has found it
difficult to live with his fame.'' Mr Michael Gavin, 40, who described
the verdict as ''shocking'' said: ''Brian Clough and Eric Cantona have
both attacked supporters in the heat of the game and got away with far
less of a punishment.''
However, Mr Mark Douglas, 24, approved of the sentence and felt it
would ''cool Ferguson down''. He said: ''If an everyday person with
previous convictions had done it in the street, the result would have
been the same. The fact he is on a public stage is even worse. He should
be setting an example.''

A VERITABLE Who's Who of Scottish politics, and some who are likely to
be big names in the future, will converge at Glasgow University Union
debating chamber tomorrow evening to lock oratorical horns in the John
Smith Memorial Debate, sponsored by The Herald.
Speaking at the one-off tribute to the late Labour Party leader, who
was a former member and champion of the Glasgow debates union, will be
Shadow Home Secretary Donald Dewar, SNP leader Alex Salmond, Minister of
State for Health Gerry Malone, and Liberal Democrat Foreign Affairs
spokesman Menzies Campbell.
Battle will commence at 7.30pm over the motion This House has no
confidence in Her Majesty's Government. In attendance will be Baroness
Smith of Gilmorehill and her family, along with members of the John
Smith Memorial Trust and university officials.
Mr Smith was a prominent debater and political figure while studying
at Glasgow University, where he graduated with an MA and LL B.
He won the British student debating championship, the Observer Mace in
1962, which was renamed as the John Smith Memorial Mace following his
death in 1994.
Student union president, Mr Stuart Haire, said: ''John Smith will
always be regarded as one of the finest orators that the union has ever
produced. A debate in his memory is indeed a very fitting tribute.''
Current debates convener Mr Shehzaad Sacranie, a position Mr Smith
once held, said: ''We hope the evening will be the most important event
in this year's debating calendar, because of John Smith's importance
within the debating context.''
Also competing will be three former world champion debaters from the
university, Mr Duncan Hamilton, Mr Manus Blessing, and Mr Kevin Snaeder.
Debates have been held at the university since its foundation in 1451
and in their present location in the high-walled debating chamber for
more than 130 years.
Public attendance at tomorrow's debate, at 7.30pm in the debates
chamber, Glasgow University union will be by invitation only.

JAMES FREEMAN, Home Affairs Correspondent, examines the implications
of the Ferguson ruling on sport and how the Scottish courts have been
moving in this direction for more than 20 years.
LORD Hope's declaration from the Appeal Court bench in the Duncan
Ferguson case has cleared the air once and for all about the position of
the criminal justice system in relation to criminal violence on the
field of play.
The law appears to have been building up towards this moment from as
early as 1974, when the then solicitor general, Mr John McCluskey, QC --
now Lord McCluskey -- sounded a clear warning at a UEFA congress in
Edinburgh.
It was not, he said, the practice of the legal authorities to bring
charges against players who misbehaved on the park but the football
authorities had to be mindful that when one player attacked another with
fists or feet, a criminal assault took place.
Unless the football authorities took suitable disciplinary steps ''the
time could come when those responsible for administering the criminal
law might have to step in''.
It would appear the hour has clearly come when the football
authorities have to face up to past failure: Duncan Ferguson is merely
the individual who is carrying the can.
Even in 1988, when Ibrox players Graham Roberts, Terry Butcher, and
Chris Woods stood trial for a breach of the peace during a
highly-charged Old Firm match alongside Celtic's Frank McAvennie, QC
Donald MacAulay -- now Lord MacAulay of Bragar -- described it as a test
case, no footballer having ever before had to face a charge of that
nature.
In a dissenting appeal judgement, Lord Murray said of that case that
once violent physical conduct was legitimised under the rules of a sport
as in football, a radically different context was set up from the
ordinary public street or public place. His view was outweighed by Lord
Justice Clerk Ross and Lord Allanbridge and the stage was set.
The willingness of the authorities to become involved has gathered
pace since that point, yet the feeling persists that the law is not
being applied evenly. The classic example was the case of two Hearts
players, Craig Levein and Graeme Hogg, who came to blows in a friendly
match, both men being sent off and Hogg leaving the field on a stretcher
with a severe face injury.
The procurator-fiscal at Kirkcaldy did not receive a report from the
police on the incident and no prosecution was taken, despite the fact
that the actions were witnessed.
Similarly, no action was taken against an Auckland rugby forward who
shattered the jaw of Borders forward, Brian Renwick, in a showcase game
at Hawick last year -- an incident which was captured on video by a
television company and which was reported to the police by Renwick.
Other cases have, however, resulted in prosecution, and at an
increasing pace. Last year, there were around a dozen cases in Scotland
alone, mainly arising from incidents during football and rugby matches
but including one at an Inverness shinty match.
Several of the prosecutions last year resulted in prison sentences,
the most exemplary of which was the nine months imposed on Preston Lodge
rugby player Scott McMillan for butting an opponent and smashing his jaw
and cheekbone.
At the same time, a North-east football player was cleared at
Peterhead Sheriff Court after the sheriff ruled that a leg-breaking
tackle on an Aberdeen player did not amount to a criminal offence.
However, in Ferguson's case the depute fiscal said in his summing up
that play had stopped immediately before Ferguson's butt on McStay and
that it was beyond reasonable doubt that Ferguson's purpose had been to
inflict damage on McStay in pursuance of a quarrel.
The Crown Office said earlier this year to The Herald that there had
been no policy decision to treat sporting offenders in the same manner
as offenders in a street brawl and that each case was dealt with on its
own circumstances. The possibility of a crowd in a large stadium
becoming inflamed was also taken into account.
The police in Scotland hold roughly the same position: that there is
no set policy laid down by the Association of Chief Police Officers of
Scotland and there is no increased willingness on the part of the police
to become involved in on-the-field criminal incidents.
The duty and the willingness has always been there, which points the
finger clearly in the direction of contact sports erupting more and more
often into criminal violence.

A GLASGOW-born convicted murderer was freed by two masked gunmen
yesterday in an ''SAS-style'' raid on a prison van.
Alan Byrne, 44, sentenced to
life at the Old Bailey in 1985, was being taken under escort to a
cancer treatment unit when the hold-up took place.
The gunmen -- described by one witness as ''done out in black and
looking like the SAS'' -- fired two warning shots and threatened three
warders, a navigator, and the driver accompanying Byrne moments after
the vehicle arrived at Newcastle General Hospital.
The prison officers were forced at gunpoint to remove Byrne's
handcuffs and lie on the floor while the prisoner and his accomplices
ran to a waiting vehicle and sped away. No-one was injured during the
incident, which happened at 9.25am.
Byrne, a Category A inmate, had earlier left Frankland prison, Co
Durham, with his escort to keep an appointment at the hospital. He was
given a life sentence in June 1985 for murder and possession of a
firearm.
A spokesman for Northumbria police said: ''This was clearly well
planned by the gunmen. Byrne is a dangerous man and no-one should
approach him if he is spotted by a member of the public.'' Having been
born in Glasgow, ''there is a possibility he may go back there''.
The spokesman said Byrne's rescuers brandished a handgun and a
shotgun: ''Two warning shots were fired into the air.''
Byrne managed to break free and escape over a wall with the two masked
men before running along nearby streets to a waiting vehicle.
''The three got into a red Rover car driven by a fourth man and it
sped off,'' added the spokesman. The car was later found abandoned in
Newcastle.
An eyewitness to yesterday's escape, Mr John Battista, said: ''I heard
a shot and looked round -- everything happened very quickly.
''I saw three men running across the car park and then climbing over
the wall of the hospital. One was carrying a pistol and another one had
a shotgun -- they were all done out in black. It looked like the SAS.
''I saw a warder running after them but he gave up the chase pretty
quickly. I suppose we're lucky nobody was injured.''
The director of security at the Prison Service, Mr Richard Tilt, said:
''It is a great relief, and a tribute to the officers' courage and
training, that none of the staff was injured in this violent and
terrifying incident.''
Byrne was sentenced to life at the Old Bailey in June 1985 for
murdering security guard John McWilliams, 56, during a #9456 armed wages
snatch on a Securicor van in Brentford, west London.
Byrne and co-accused Richard Trump, then 31, received a total of four
life sentences for murder, attempted robbery, possessing a firearm with
intent to endanger life, and possession of a firearm with intent to
resist arrest.
* Two prisoners escaped from a young offenders' institution, police
said last night. The pair, who are in their early 20s, are described as
''dangerous'' and the public have been warned not to approach them.
They escaped from Everthorpe, near Hull, while working on a prison
farm.
Inspector Steve Love of Humberside Police said: ''There is no
suggestion that either of these men has used firearms, but one has come
to notice for using violence. If a member of the public approached them,
they could be violent.''
The men were named as Guy Furniss, 23, and Kevin Jarvis, 24. Furniss
was sentenced to 12 months for possession of drugs and conspiracy to
steal on April 22 this year. Jarvis was sentenced to five years and six
months at Newcastle Crown Court on July 5, 1994, for two burglaries and
aggravated taking without consent.

<HEADLINE>A day in the life of Barlinnie -- a 'truly hellish place'</HEADLINE>

THE Barlinnie Prison gate slid shut on Duncan Ferguson at 3.15pm
yesterday afternoon, plunging the pampered and wealthy young footballer
into the institutionalised beehive which is Scotland's biggest jail.
Because Barlinnie is running at 132% capacity, many of its 1135
inmates have to share. There are around 860 cells. The chronic
overcrowding means that all the faults and drawbacks of a vast prison
built 120 years ago for Victorian conditions come together in Barlinnie
and that no matter how hard management and staff try it can never be
anything other than a truly hellish place, a great clearing house of
crime and criminals, from which several hundred can come and go in a
day.
The common public perception that Ferguson will receive special
treatment by being sent to an open prison is simply not true.
The sentence is too short for such a consideration to apply, so
Ferguson will remain in Barlinnie, the prison for Glasgow Sheriff Court
at which the original sentence was passed, and he will almost certainly
have to share. The shortness of the sentence also precludes the granting
of any request by Ferguson to do his porridge in an English jail where
he might encounter less hostility.
In England, he may have a millionaire lifestyle but now even basic
privacy will for him be a thing of the past. Unless he is fortunate
enough to get into a hall with access to night sanitation he could end
up being reduced to using a plastic chamber pot, queuing with several
hundred other men at 6am to slop out in a stinking sink.
The last well-known figure to serve time in a Scottish jail was the
actor Eric Cullen, who also went to Barlinnie for a short period pending
appeal. He did receive special treatment, being housed in the prison
hospital, but that was merely a sensible precaution by the Barlinnie
authorities faced with a very difficult management problem arising from
the nature of Cullen's offences, his physical size, and his vulnerable
personality.
Ferguson is unlikely to face any such difficulties. Although his
previous brushes with the law means he is probably very familiar with
police stations and cells, Barlinnie will come as a very considerable
shock to him. When he arrived yesterday in the prison van from
Edinburgh, most probably sharing with other criminals who had come from
the Appeal Court, the chances are he would have had to wait to be
allocated a cell.
''He will be treated in exactly the same way as any other prisoner,''
said a Scottish prison service spokesman.
In that event, he would have been stuck in one of the infamous ''dog
boxes'', tiny holding cells which are smelly, degrading, and
claustrophobic. It is a shock introduction to prison life.
Ferguson's clothes would be taken from him and he would be issued with
prison kit of denims and striped shirt. He will be asked his religious
persuasion, a precaution to avoid sectarian warfare on the wings. He
would then have his first prison shower, something which he will come to
appreciate as a rarity in the next six weeks, and on to examination by a
prison doctor for such indelicacies as head lice. He will also be
assessed for suicide risk.
Although it is more likely that Ferguson will be feted as a hero
inside the Bar-L, should he face harassment he can request protection
under Rule 80 of prison regulations. He could then be moved out of
association with other prisoners and into the segregation unit.
When he rises at 6.30am, Ferguson will have to wash at one of the
communal ablutions in each hall, probably along with 200 others. The
food is neither better nor worse than food can be when cooked for 1200
people.
His meal last night was a choice of fish or gammon.
From 8am to noon, Ferguson will work, probably at making concrete
slabs or recovering scrap metal, and after lunch there is outdoor
recreation for an hour. Barlinnie has a red blaze football pitch which
could be very hard on the star's reputedly delicate knees. Everton
Football Club may be less than pleased at the prospect of their #4.3m
investment kicking about with players who may be of a different
religious persuasion and none too fussy about high tackles.
Then he and his fellow prisoners will be locked in their cells for an
hour before more work in the afternoon, then a meal around 5pm.
In the evening there is recreation -- gym, snooker, pool or watching
TV -- before lights-out at 9.30 pm.
Ferguson's day will run like clockwork -- work, meals, recreation,
association, all timed to the minute until it is back behind the cell
door at 9pm.

<HEADLINE>Expelled pupils 'flout court order'</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>975929765</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE headmaster of a school which went to court to ban two expelled
pupils from its corridors last night revealed that the boys were openly
flouting the order.
Mr Graeme Smith said: ''There's nothing we can do about it.''
The two 15-year-olds were banned by the courts last week from going
anywhere near their former school, Gracemount High, Liberton, Edinburgh,
after, it was alleged, they attacked Mr Smith and his deputy.
They were charged with assault and in the first case of its kind in
Scotland, the pair have been ordered to keep away from Gracemount whilst
the case is being prepared for the Children's Panel.
But yesterday Mr Smith said they had returned twice since being
banned, goading teachers and showing off to friends.
The boys, who cannot be named for legal reasons, were originally
expelled after a series of run-ins with the staff.
Allegations included that they consistently returned to their former
school, riding bikes through the corridors and shouting abuse at
teachers, and that they refused to leave the school once and shouted and
swore at teachers.
It was also claimed that when Mr Smith and his deputy were called the
boys swore at them then attacked them, throwing punches and that they
attacked janitor Peter Moore when he tried to intervene.
Police arrested the boys and charged them with assault, and Mr Smith
was granted the interim interdict at Edinburgh Sheriff Court on October
4.
But yesterday he said they had been back twice since then. Unless they
were violent, he said, there was nothing anyone could do.
He said: ''It's a nightmare. I've never experienced anything like it
before and I never want to again.
''It's the frustration of having gone through all that we have and yet
we are no further on.
''I thought that if they broke the order the police could come and
take them away.
''But it seems that unless they are violent it is not a criminal
offence and therefore the police can do nothing except what they were
doing before, namely asking them to leave.
''If we want to implement the ban we have to go through the civil
courts to do it.''

''THE court has no wish to intervene in physical contact sports such
as professional football. It is well aware that contest in physical
fitness, strength and agility and some measure of aggression is part of
the game for both player and spectator.
''But when acts are done which go well beyond what can be regarded as
normal physical contact and an assault is committed, the court has a
duty to condemn and punish such conduct.
''It has to be made clear to both players and the public that such
criminal acts cannot be tolerated on the field of play any more than
they can be tolerated in any place in this country.
''A footballer who assaults another player on the football field is
not entitled to expect leniency from the court just because the incident
occurred in course of a football match.
''On the contrary, one of the factors that may indicate the gravity of
the offence is the fact that an assault has been committed in public
before so many spectators.
''This fact becomes all the more important when the player is a public
figure and the incident occurs during a game that has such a high
profile as a league match in the Scottish Premier Division.
''These are fixtures which set the standard of conduct throughout the
country and any sentence for assault committed in these circumstances
must reflect the need to deter others from engaging in similar acts of
criminal violence.''

THE Scottish Prison Officer's Association yesterday lost a legal bid
to ban a BBC Scotland Frontline programme alleging brutal assaults on
prisoners at Barlinnie prison.
Lord Kirkwood, who watched the programme on a television screen set up
in the Court of Session, refused to grant interim interdict against the
BBC.
Lord Kirkwood said: ''The programme deals with a matter which is
clearly of public interest. It is important that the media should be
permitted to comment on matters of public interest, provided they keep
within the necessary legal strictures.''
The judge said in this case it was alleged the broadcast would be
likely to prejudice the rights of prison officers to a fair trial.
But Lord Kirkwood said he had not been persuaded that would be the
case if the programme were broadcast, particularly as the alleged
assaults were said to have taken place a long time ago and no
identification was made of the alleged assailants.
The programme, Beaten by the System, is presented by Susan Donald and
is due to be screened tonight.
The progamme shows an interview with the senior prison medical officer
at Barlinnie, Dr Simon Danson, who alleges that prisoners he had
examined had been victims of violent assault.
In the screened interview Dr Danson states that prisoners he had
medically examined showed evidence of being beaten and tortured. He said
he had made official complaints on behalf of the prisoners.
It is claimed that the Crown Office is now investigating the
allegations of assault against three prisoners, but has come to no
decision on whether anyone should be charged with assault. It was
claimed the assaults took place after prison riots in January 1994, when
prisoners who had been involved were transferred to Barlinnie.
The Scottish Prison Officers Association claimed that the showing
should be postponed until after any future trial takes place.
Lawyers for the Association are now considering whether to appeal to a
bench of three judges today for an eleventh hour ban on the programme.
Mr Eddie Hunter, SPOA chairman, said last night he was shocked by the
decision and added that he would personally urge lawyers to launch an
appeal today.
The editor of Frontline Scotland, Mr Neil McDonald, said: ''We are
glad the court has given viewers the chance to make up their own minds
about conditions at Barlinnie.''

ROUND the world they will go next year, Jose, Placido, and the Nessun
Dorma man, known to his fans as Fat Lucy, singing for their supper.
The three biggest names in classical music came to Wembley stadium
yesterday to announce details of their first such tour. It will take
Luciano Pavarotti, Jose Carreras, and Placido Domingo to four continents
and five cities, starting on June 29 in Tokyo, moving to London on July
6 in the stadium chosen for the launch, to New York on July 20, and to
Munich on August 3. They finish in Melbourne on March 1, 1997.
James Levine will conduct and two orchestras will play, the
Philharmonia in Tokyo, London, and Munich, and the Metropolitan
orchestra in New York.
Around 300,000 people are expected to attend the concerts, all of
which are being held in sports arenas adapted to accommodate the huge
set from which they will sing. To ensure that the acoustics are perfect
and the audience gets an ideal view, the seating in each is being cut by
an average of 20,000.
The two-and-a-half hour concerts will not be televised globally but
they will be televised locally. That will mean an audience greater than
the lucky 50,000, give or take a few, who can afford the tickets, which
range in price from #35 to #350 in Britain.  Ticket sales open today.

SCOTLAND and Everton footballer Duncan Ferguson was sent to jail
yesterday as Scotland's leading judge made it clear that assaults on the
football field would not be tolerated by the courts.
In rejecting Ferguson's appeal against a three-month sentence for an
assault on another player, Lord Hope, the Lord Justice General, took the
opportunity to lay down the law on sporting violence.
He made it clear that high- profile players in Scotland's Premier
League must set the standard of behaviour for others, or face the
consequences.
Immediately the appeal was rejected, the Crown moved for a warrant for
Ferguson's arrest and the former Rangers striker winked and smiled at
members of his family at the back of the court as he left the dock to
begin his sentence.
Mr Blair Morgan, Ferguson's solicitor said afterwards: ''I think it is
fair to say Duncan was not very optimistic but his legal team were. I
spoke to him afterwards. He did not say very much. He had expected the
worst.''
Ferguson, 23, was convicted in May this year at Glasgow Sheriff Court
of head-butting defender John McStay during a Premier League game
between Rangers and Raith Rovers in April 1994. He was released
immediately when he lodged an appeal.
Yesterday, at the Justiciary Appeal Court, Mr John Mitchell QC,
defence counsel, said his client wished to abandon his appeal against
conviction and challenge only the three-month sentence.
Mr Mitchell told the court: ''Mr Ferguson entirely accepts now, that
whatever may be said in relation to football matches or other sports
which are highly competitive and about things happening in the heat of
the moment, he should never have behaved in the way he behaved at that
time and he bitterly regrets having done so.''
He also accepted that even though misconduct on the field would be
dealt with by the sport's own ruling body, that did not prevent the
criminal authorities from intervening.
Mr Mitchell explained that the Scottish Football Association had
banned Ferguson for 12 matches for the head-butting incident but had not
yet served any of that ban.
Mr Mitchell referred to his client's three previous convictions, the
first at Stirling Sheriff Court in February 1992, when he had been fined
for breach of the peace and resisting arrest.
In March 1993, he was again fined at the same court for assault and in
August that year at Cupar Sheriff Court, he was placed on probation for
another incident involving an assault.
The sheriff had described this as a short but quite appalling record
of violent offences but Mr Mitchell argued that this was ''completely
overstating'' the situation.
The incidents had taken place over a period of little more than a
year, when Ferguson was aged 19-20. He had been provoked in the
incidents and no serious injury had resulted.
Mr Mitchell produced two letters for the court, one from Everton
chairman Peter Johnson, and one from Rangers manager Walter Smith.
In his letter, Walter Smith pointed out that, when Rangers signed
Ferguson for #4m he was the most expensive player in Britain. The price
tag and close media attention placed him under considerable pressure.
He described Ferguson as an extremely personable young man who had
undoubtedly been immature when he arrived at Ibrox and found it
difficult to cope with his high profile.
However, he quickly matured and came to realise that being a prominent
player brought with it considerable responsibilites.
Mr Mitchell told the court that, in spite of the image painted of
Ferguson in the media, the evidence in the documents before the court
presented a very different picture.
He quoted from a letter from the Everton chairman which described
Ferguson as ''one of the most popular players ever to wear an Everton
shirt'', and very far removed from his media image.
Off the field, he was quiet and to some degree something of a loner
but the public in Liverpool had taken him to their hearts.
Mr Johnston also talked of Ferguson as a caring young man who had
willingly given of his time to visit children in hospital and with
special needs. He saw him as a good ambassador for Everton, who signed
him from Rangers for #4.3m in December 1994.
Mr Mitchell asked the appeal court to consider the constructive option
of a community service order, the sentence which the English courts
imposed earlier this year on Manchester United player Eric Cantona for
an assault on a spectator.
''This young man has prospects of being a very successful and
responsible member of his profession,'' added Mr Mitchell. ''The
destructive effect of a custodial sentence would be difficult to
overstate.''
Lord Hope, who heard the appeal with Lords Allanbridge and Osborne,
agreed that the sheriff had overstated the matter by describing
Ferguson's record as appalling.
However, the most important factor about the record was that the
assault on McStay had been committed while Ferguson was on probation for
another assault.
He added: ''For a person who has been dealt with leniently in that way
to commit an offence of the same kind while on probation is a serious
matter and has to be weighed up very carefully by the court in
considering whether a further non-custodial disposal would be
appropriate.''
Lord Hope said the appeal court had considered very carefully the plea
made by Ferguson's counsel for community service.
What they had to consider ultimately was whether the sentence chosen
by the sheriff could be regarded as excessive in the circumstances.
''We have reached the view that we would not be justified in
interfering with the sentence. In our opinion, in all the circumstances,
a sentence of three months' imprisonment which was intended to be an
effective punishment and a deterrent to others cannot be described as
excessive.
''We have no alternative in this tragic case but to refuse the
appeal.''

Strasbourg
EVEN the Eurocrats of Brussels, with their famous talent for meddling,
have failed to find the secret recipe of Coca-Cola -- so far.
A German socialist Euro-MP, Mr Gerhard Schmid, is pressing to have
European Commission inspectors discover the recipe which, according to
Coca-Cola's management, is not even known to the chairman of its board.
Mr Schmid is campaigning to have the secret revealed because he
believes Coke drinkers face possible health hazards as long as only some
of the ingredients are known.
The EU's problem is that Coca-Cola is not made in Europe -- it is only
imported in concentrated form and distributed after being diluted.
The Euro-MP, who summoned reporters to a news conference yesterday,
argued that if Coca-Cola's managers failed to come up with the answer,
the drink should be banned throughout Europe.
When asked: ''Do you drink Coke yourself?''
He replied: ''Occasionally. You must remember I am a Bavarian and I
drink beer.''
For good measure, he said he wanted similar inquiries made about Pepsi
-- Coke's great rival -- and MacDonald's hamburgers.
''The problem with them is exactly the same,'' he said.
Mr Schmid believes consumers could be at danger if the recipe remains
a secret, and that EU competition law is being distorted as long as
European-made drinks are subjected to analysis while rival imports are
not.
''We know only some of the ingredients of Coca-Cola, not all of them.
Until we know them all, and until we know the proportions, we cannot be
satisfied,'' he said.
Mr Schmid wrote to the European Commission demanding that the recipe
be disclosed. The commission replied that it had asked Coca-Cola for
details and been refused -- and it had taken no further action.
It noted that food manufacturers could let the Commission know their
recipes and that commercial confidence would be respected. But that did
not apply to food imports.
''This would never happen in the United States with imported drinks,''
Mr Schmid complained.
''The US would make sure that all ingredients of all imported drinks
were well known and safe on the basis of proper checks.''
Mr Schmid said that when the Commission demanded the recipe from
America its investigators did not know Coke was only imported to Europe,
and therefore had no legal right to make such a demand.
''I want the law changed to allow the Commission to try again,'' Mr
Schmid said.
Meanwhile, impatient Euro-MPs meeting in Strasbourg for the monthly
European Parliament plenary, last night gave France another week to
provide technical information or face a possible challenge in the
European Court of Justice over continued nuclear testing in the South
Pacific.
Commission President Jacques Santer told the meeting that France had
been given until October 23 to come up with information it has been
accused of withholding.
The stand-off gave the Commission another chance to settle its
internal divisions over a possible censure of France, and it provided
the French with a breathing space to fend off a legal challenge being
demanded by the anti-testing cross-party alliance in the assembly.
The timing means in effect that President Jacques Chirac -- under fire
from international opinion and facing mounting pressure at home over his
defiant stand -- has five days in which to respond to the satisfaction
of the Commission.
Under EU law the Commission, as ''guardian'' of the various European

obligations under the Euratom agreement to take health and safety
measures in the test area.
If it finds France has not -- a view taken by a majority of Euro-MPs
and much of the rest of the world -- the French could face being sued by
the Commission.

BBC and ITV are both to adapt the Jane Austen classic, Emma, for the
small screen. ITV announced last week that Austen's story of the
spirited but sometimes too outspoken heroine will be the jewel of its
1996 autumn schedule. BBC, meanwhile, with audiences of up to 11 million
for its adaptation of Pride and Prejudice, has plans for feature length
versions of Emma and Sense and Sensibility.

BRITISH Gas is expected to be cleared of blame for an explosion which
killed father-of-two John Clarke, 37, and destroyed 11 flats in
Cotmanhay, near Ilkeston, Derbyshire, on July 8. A report by Health and
Safety Executive investigators, to be published this month, blames
soaring summer temperatures for causing cracks in the ground which
reached gas mains and split them.

TALKS will be held in London tomorrow about the fate of the George
Square post office building.
Supporters of a plan to buy it to house the new National Gallery of
Scottish Art hope that a decision has not yet been taken to sell it
instead to a private developer.
Mr Tom Monaghan, Glasgow district's chief executive, claimed yesterday
that Post Office officials had stated ''very clearly'' at a meeting on
Tuesday that they would announce the following day that the #3m gallery
bid by the Glasgow Development Agency had failed.
At the same time, the Royal Mail claimed that it had not yet decided
which bid to accept.
Council leader Pat Lally said the Royal Mail had reacted to a call by
the GDA after Tuesday's meeting to ''reconsider'' the building's fate.
It has invited those who attended Tuesday's meeting -- the heads of
the council, the GDA, and the trustees of the National Galleries of
Scotland -- to a board meeting in London tomorrow.
Mr Lally did not know if the move meant that the Post Office had
''back-tracked'' on its alleged decision to reject the art gallery bid
but he hoped that a favourable decision would be made.
It is believed that an unnamed property developer has bid about #4.5m
and plans a commercial scheme for the building. It is understood that a
third bid, which falls between the others in financial terms, has been
received. The closing date was October 4.
The Royal Mail spoke of being ''extremely disappointed that our
position appears to have been misunderstood''.
Mr Kenneth Graham, Scottish Post Office chairman, said Post Office
officials had met the gallery supporters to discuss ''certain aspects of
their tender'' but he could not comment on their interpretation of the
meeting.
He added: ''I and all my colleagues would wish that our building
became a national gallery -- there is nothing we would love more -- but
we have got to place our properties on the open market. We cannot
dispose of public assets at any price we think. It has to be a market
value.''

THE chairman of the troubled Burns International Festival has left his
home and family and is understood to be living in England.
Councillor Eric Rowe has not attended recent festival board meetings
or council committees and has been missing from work for two weeks.
The festival company confirmed that Councillor Rowe had ''apparently
left Ayrshire'' and that his place in the chair had been taken by
Councillor Donald Urquhart, from Nithsdale District Council.
Councillor Rowe has represented Mauchline on Cumnock and Doon Valley
District Council for seven years and is chairman of the planning
committee. He did not stand for the new East Ayrshire authority and was
proposing to step back from politics to ''pursue other matters''.
It is understood that Councillor Rowe left home the day after he
welcomed the Princess Royal to Kilmarnock to unveil a statue of Burns
and his publisher Wilson and to launch the festival officially.
His departure, although not yet confirmed as anything other than
temporary, is a further blow to the festival which has been the subject
of criticism for poor planning and insufficient detail.
The festival director, Mr John Struthers, was joined by Councillor
Rowe and his wife Elizabeth two weeks ago to launch the festival
programme and answer some of the criticism.
The councillor said at the time: ''I am relishing this challenge and
looking forward enormously to the festival getting under way next
year.''
Throughout 1996, a programme of events will be held to commemorate the
bicentenary of the death of Robert Burns.
In August, The Herald disclosed that the festival was under fire from
all sides for lack of local consultation, being slow off the mark in its
organisation, and for missing the target in its range of events.
Since then, Mr Struthers and his team have worked hard to improve the
image of the festival and have put at least some flesh on the bones of
next year's programme of events.
A spokesman for the festival company said: ''The apparent departure
from Ayrshire of Councillor Eric Rowe will not have a detrimental effect
on the festival.
''We have a strong committee structure and every member is committed
to working with John Struthers for the festival. The festival is bigger
than any one person.
''For the time being, vice-chairman Councillor Donald Urquhart is
stepping up into the role of chairman.''
Mrs Rowe was not available for comment at her Mauchline home but it is
believed that she was given a letter by her husband two weeks ago and
has since had a telephone call from England.
Councillor Rowe was director of the Doonbank House nursing home,
Dalmellington, from which a staff nurse disappeared two weeks ago.
It is not known if there is any connection between the two departures
and Strathclyde Police said that they were not involved in ''any of the
matters''.

A COMPUTER whizz kid recruited bank insiders and swindled his way to a
millionaire's life of luxury during a ''highly organised sophisticated
international fraud'', a London court heard yesterday.
With ''potentially limitless'' possibilities beckoning, the alleged
''captain of the criminal enterprise'', Michael Boparan, got them to
raid highly confidential data bases.
Valuable account information from high spending clients was then used
to forge large numbers of gold and platinum credit cards, claimed Mark
Tomassi, prosecuting.
Corporate and individual accounts were then plundered and on some
occasions up to #10,000 at a time was withdrawn during over-the-counter
transactions.
The barrister told Southwark Crown Court the criminal scheme was so
cleverly contrived that National Westminster Bank chiefs hardly knew
what hit them.
By the time police caught up with Mr Boparan and the others allegedly
involved, more than #1m worth of cash and property had been ''netted''.
Mr Tomassi told the jury Mr Boparan bought expensive cars, lived
''very comfortably'' in a plush apartment and enjoyed five-star hotels.
''He was going around spending and enjoying the high life,'' said the
barrister. ''He was operating a massive fraud and making himself very
rich as a result of it.''
In the dock with the 30-year-old businessman, of St John's Wood,
north-west London, are Bulent Osman, 30, of Keston, Kent, and Russell
Jones, 27, of Southend.
All three deny the joint charge of conspiracy to defraud NatWest,
other central clearing banks, companies, corporations, and individuals.
Mr Tomassi said all three, as well as others not before the court,
were involved in ''wholesale'' defrauding of banks on a ''massive
scale''.
He said they operated a system that ''milked'' the data base at
NatWest's card transaction centre at Southend-on-Sea, Essex.
Mr Tomassi went on: ''The system that was in place and dishonestly put
into action was so effective that indeed the National Westminster Bank
could hardly keep up with the level of fraud.''
Mr Tomassi claimed Mr Boparan had recruited at least four people
working at the bank to help him carry out his scheme.
''Instead of going in and doing their job, they rifled through the
data base looking at confidential information, printing it off and
selling it. This case has demonstrated there was a ready market for such
information,'' the barrister told the court.
''This case, you may think, is interesting and indeed particularly
serious in view of the fact that according to the prosecution you are
dealing here with figures in excess of #1m and a fraud that, had it not
been stopped, was potentially limitless.''
But the barrister said that, despite the scheme's high level of
sophistication and organisation, it was caught out in the ''most
mundane'' way.
A police constable walking the beat noticed that a car parked outside
Mr Boparan's home did not have a tax disc.
Further inquiries revealed the vehicle had been bought fraudulently,
and his fingerprints were found on the car. Inside was a wealth of
incriminating evidence including a credit card imprinter, a large number
of cards, and bank screen printouts.
The trial continues.

errors in a letter it drafted to French President Jacques Chirac
protesting at the resumption of nuclear testing or, as they say in

letter, drafted in French, began ''Dear Monsieur le President'', and

AS all 67 of the Lewis chess pieces go on exhibition in Edinburgh
today, a possibility has emerged of the 11 in Scottish ownership staying
in Scotland.
The 67 pieces are in the joint ownership of the British Museum, which
has 56, and the National Museums of Scotland, which has 11.
At a preview of the exhibition at the Royal Scottish Museum yesterday,
Mr Mark Jones, director, said it was possible the 11 pieces would be
loaned again for display in Scotland.
''It is important that pieces of this status should be seen in
different parts of Scotland,'' he said.
The Edinburgh exhibition follows the display of the chess pieces at
the new Western Isles Museum in Lewis. The arts and leisure committee of
the Western Isles Council decided last week to return the pieces and
expressed its view that they should be displayed permanently in the
Western Isles.
Mr Jones said the 11 pieces owned by the NMS would be among Scottish
material to be displayed in the new Museum of Scotland, opening in 1998.
Between 1995 and 1997, the NMS would loan many key objects to museums
throughout Scotland.

<HEADLINE>Rebuke for the right. Portillo put in his place</HEADLINE>

DEFENCE Secretary Michael Portillo suffered one rebuke, and faces
another from the Prime Minister, following his blatant Tory conference
bid to re-establish himself as the right-wing figurehead.
Tomorrow, Mr Major is expected to remind his party that he makes
European defence policy, not Mr Portillo.
Yesterday, deputy Michael Heseltine delivered the first part of the
''double whammy'' -- a subtle Portillo put-down: ''You can call yourself
a Communist, a Socialist, a Liberal or a Conservative. You can wrap
yourself in any flag of any colour and you can mouth whatever patriotic
rhetoric the PR merchants can devise.''
But, Mr Heseltine insisted, Britain for the sake of trade has to be
heavily involved in Europe. Anything else is a ''giant fraud, the
ultimate betrayal of Britain''.
This was a coded reaction to Mr Portillo's conference speech on
Tuesday which Cabinet colleagues regarded as irresponsible in its raw
attack on Brussels and a phoney concept that the EU Commission is
seeking to control British defence policy.
''With a Conservative Government, Britain will not join a single
European army,'' declared Mr Portillo.
Duty bound, the Prime Minister at his side led the applause for a
Portillo standing ovation with previous knowledge of what his Defence
Secretary was going to say.
Mr Major is grateful to Mr Portillo for his failure to challenge him
for the leadership last July but the Prime Minister has received an
avalanche of complaints about Mr Portillo's ''jingoism'' and in
particular the anger of Tory MEPs in the European Parliament.
In Brussels, a spokesman for European President Jacques Santer
described the anti-European sentiments being expressed in Blackpool as
''grotesque''. Mr Santer was said to have found it ''deplorable'' that
certain politicians were creating straw men just to knock them down
again publicly.
Tomorrow, Mr Major is expected to deliver the second part of the
''double whammy'' when he winds up the Tory conference.
Mr Major's declared bottom line on European policy was set out on his
speech to the University of Leyden in Holland in September last year. In
this he declared: ''We have also decided at Maastricht to work towards a
common European defence policy, based on the Western European Union.
''There is serious and detailed work to be done before we have turned
these general propositions into reality. Britain will be at the core of
this enterprise.''
The Prime Minister is prepared to let Mr Portillo re-establish himself
on the right wing of his party over Mr John Redwood, who challenged him
for the leadership last July, but he will not allow his Defence
Secretary to use a conference speech to try to shift British defence
policy in regard to Europe.
The Portillo performance was in danger of wrecking the Tory drive in
Blackpool to reunite in the face of the awesome task of defeating Labour
again at the next General Election, a mere 18 months away at most.
Labour leader Tony Blair capitalised on it, accusing the Prime
Minister of ''final surrender'' to the Euro-rebels. In an article in The
European, Mr Blair describes Mr Portillo's speech as a ''remarkable
pantomime performance. But it was devoid of substance''.
He said the ''rebels have taken over the party. A significant part of
the Tory party now actually wants to take Britain out of Europe.''
Behind the scenes yesterday, in meetings of Cabinet Ministers at the
conference hotel, Mr Major and Mr Heseltine were made aware that the
Defence Secretary must not be allowed to usurp the conference --
particularly as the Tory Euro-sceptics who have so embarrassed the Prime
Minister over the last two years were deliberately underplaying their
speeches and lobbying at the conference.
Mr Heseltine, after his ebullient conference speech, was trying to
play down the Portillo threat. ''The fact is that all political parties
have got a profound debate going on within them,'' he said on ITV.
''Michael was making a party conference speech illustrating views and
attitudes of mind and anxieties that exist. I make my points and he
makes his.''
The plan at Blackpool yesterday was that the main fire should fall on
Mr Blair, described as an ''imposter'' who has not yet staked out his
commitment to capitalism. A succession of Cabinet Ministers announced
actions to come over the next 12 months to reassure Tory voters.
Health Secretary Stephen Dorrell described himself as a
''buro-sceptic'', looking for a 5% cut in NHS bureaucracy.
Social Security Secretary Peter Lilley hopes to save #1000m a year
over four years with a new benefits smart-card to defeat bogus
claimants. He is also hoping to save #200m on those claiming refugee
status here.
Forty thousand a year are seeking refugee status in Britain and if
they are rejected their benefits will cease while they go through the
process of appeal against rejection. ''We want to be a safe haven but
not a soft touch,'' said Mr Lilley, who is trying to find ways to cut
his #90bn budget.
Transport Secretary Sir George Young, also trying to save money,
announced that vehicle owners who are not paying for their tax discs
will find themselves wheel clamped. He also insisted that the
privatisation of British Rail would meet its deadline next spring.
Education Secretary Gillian Shephard announced there would be new
tests for head teachers and a new exam qualification in spoken English.
The conference applauded all this as indications that Tory policies
are being revitalised to counter the Blair challenge.
Today, Baroness Thatcher arrives among them as a positive and profound
declaration of her will that Mr Major should be re-elected for a fifth
term of Tory government.
Today, too, Chancellor Kenneth Clarke in a vital speech before his
Budget next month will try to reassure them tax cuts are coming,
provided he gets the reduction in State spending that he requires.
Yesterday, Mr William Waldegrave, Treasury Chief Secretary, who is in
charge of finding these cuts, was conducting a series of meetings with
the spending Ministers in one-to-one talks. Behind the scenes, there is
a bloody battle going on over public expenditure which will continue
next week when the Commons returns from the long summer recess.
Mr Heseltine's action yesterday and the Prime Minister's intervention
tomorrow are calculated to defuse the alarm within the Tory party that
Mr Portillo's speech caused.

THE so-called fat cats of the National Health Service were told by an
angry Michael Forsyth yesterday that it was time to tighten their belts.
Stung by criticism over huge pay rises being awarded to trust bosses
while nurses and other workers were being held to 3%, the Scottish
Secretary said he wanted #14m lopped off health service administration
costs.
''Senior managers must lead by example and must have regard to the
signal which large increases send at a time when they are asking their
staff to exercise restraint,'' Mr Forsyth said.
''The guiding principle for everyone working in the NHS must be to
maximise the share of resources devoted to patient care.''
As a result the chairmen of the 47 NHS trusts will receive a letter
from Mr Geoff Scaife, chief executive of the NHS in Scotland, about the
pay of their top executives.
It does not mean, a Scottish Office source stressed last night, that
Mr Jeremy Taylor, chief executive of Grampian Healthcare, will have to
give back some of the 30% pay rise he received last year, bringing his
salary to #101,000. Nor will it affect Mr Jim Currie, of Monklands and
Bellshill, whose #9000 rise to #68,000 caused a furore last week.
''This is for the future -- we don't pay these people, that is done by
trust remuneration committees -- and we can't lay down that they will
pay this or that. But they are being told to get their act together,''
the source said.
''They are going to have to link their rises more closely to what
their staff are getting, and they are also going to have to justify them
more transparently in terms of their success in shifting money into
patient care. The public have not been happy with the explanations they
have been getting.''
Mr Forsyth has asked the management executive to ensure that the level
of administration costs in NHS trusts is reduced by at least 5% and to
explore the scope for yet further reductions. This would produce savings
of more than #14m a year, which would be reinvested in patient care.
''The Government's reforms of the NHS are already delivering
improvements for patients: 44,000 more patients were treated in Scotland
last year than in the year before, and waiting times were reduced
significantly,'' he said.
''This year #800 for every man, woman, and child in Scotland will be
spent on the NHS. I am determined to achieve more. The action I have
announced today will ensure that an even higher proportion of every
pound spent on the NHS in Scotland will be available for patient care.''
Reaction from Mr Forsyth's opponents could be summed up in three words
-- ''Told you so.''
Trade union leaders were quick to point out that much of the
burgeoning cost of NHS administration has followed the reforms which Mr
Forsyth himself, as Scottish Health Minister, ushered in in 1989.
This set up the internal market system, in which services are now
bought and sold within the NHS, and hospital trusts and GP fundholders,
both leading to extensive duplication of management functions previously
carried out by health boards.
The increases are also within the guidelines the Scottish Office has
already set, but they are now acknowledged by the Scottish Ofice to be
insensitive in the current climate.
Mr Graham Smith, assistant secretary of the STUC, said: ''It is rather
ironic that Michael Forsyth has taken this sort of approach given that
it was the reforms he so strongly supports that have resulted in this
increase in bureaucracy and given chief executives the opportunity of
obtaining these huge pay rises.
''He is a late convert to the view that the consequences of the
reforms have been a huge increase in managerial posts and in the costs
of bureaucracy.''
A spokesman for the Scottish Council of the British Medical
Association said they were pleased to hear that Mr Forsyth was going to
tackle the hefty costs of administering the NHS, but hoped the money
saved would be ploughed into direct patient care.
Mr Matt Smith, Scottish secretary of Unison, whose members include
some lower-echelon administrative staff as well as nurses and ancillary
workers, said: ''We have been saying since they set up the whole system
that the costs would multiply. All he is doing is tinkering with the
problem. What we need is a fundamental reorganisation -- #14m out of
#4000m is not going to make much difference to patient care.''
Grampian Healthcare said last night that Mr Taylor's salary was
consistent with the responsibilities of running one of the UK's largest
trusts and the largest in Scotland.
The Health Minister, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, said the enormous
rise in salaries of some executives without a corresponding increase in
productivity could not be justified and he confirmed that he had written
to all NHS trusts making this point.

THE proposed #15.5bn merger of Lloyds Bank and TSB will bring
substantial advantages to Scotland, it was said yesterday, with between
500 and 600 jobs to be created in the present TSB telephone banking
centre in Glasgow.
If the deal is approved by shareholders and the regulatory
authorities, the registered office of the new Lloyds TSB Group will be
in Glasgow, which will hold the annual meetings, although the group head
office will continue to be in London.
TSB Scotland will maintain its separate identity and keep the TSB
name, unlike branches south of the Border which will carry the Lloyds
TSB logo.
Sir Robin Ibbs, chairman of Lloyds, said that press reports of job
losses had been alarmist. There was an average staff turnover of 7% in
both banks so that there would be a natural wastage of about 6000 people
each year. That would reduce the need for redundancies, which were most
likely to occur in the support and back-office functions.
The merger cannot be completed until there is an Act of Parliament,
probably in two years' time.

THE Bosnian government and its Serb enemies finally signed the pact
for a ceasefire to begin at one minute past midnight last night.
It is due to last 60 days, and peace talks are scheduled to begin on
October 31 in the US.
Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic's office said his army would halt
all warring activities except defensive ones. Minutes later Bosnian Serb
leader Radovan Karadzic also ordered his units to halt operations at the
given hour.
However, there were fears in the north as Bosnian and Croat allies
struck deep into Serb territory in an 11th-hour land grab. They said
their advances had laid the ground for ''liberating'' Banja Luka.
