SIR, We wish to correct factual errors in your article regarding the
offer by Wool Growers (GB) Ltd to our shareholders.
None of the missing shareholders referred to would be due a
''windfall'' approaching #30,000 as is reported. The largest amount due,
if the takeover is successful, to any of the missing shareholders would
be approximately #3450. Indeed the majority of those missing would be
due less than #100.
Contrary to your report, which states our last dividend was paid in
1964, we have paid a dividend every year since then. In the last five
years this has totalled #400,000.
Douglas Robertson,
Company Secretary,
Scottish, English &amp; Welsh Wool Growers Ltd

Marketing Board.

A NEW farming programme which will be used to plug the gap left by the
axeing of the lunchtime farming news slot earlier this year has been
announced by Radio Scotland.
From June 14 there will be a weekly magazine programme on medium wave
at 6.15pm on Wednesdays. Farming news will also be included on the 6am
Daybreak programme on Radio Scotland.
A BBC Scotland spokesman said that agricultural business news in
general would also be included in radio's Good Morning Scotland and
television's Reporting Scotland.
John Ross, president of the National Farmers' Union of Scotland,
hailed the news as a victory for its campaign against the dropping of
the lunchtime news slot.

IF the United States viewed Vietnam as a kind of Korea with trees,
Harold Wilson had the foresight to recognise it for what it really
represented -- an unwinnable war played out in a political minefield.
Sidestepping British involvement in the conflict was probably his
greatest achievement in foreign policy. But it was a success which has
always been underestimated. And it earned him the undying enmity of both
US President Lyndon Johnson and Labour's hard Left.
Wilson walked a tightrope over the entire question. As a pragmatist,
he knew the UK needed to maintain its ''special relationship'' with
Washington to survive in a dangerous world. Soviet military power in
Europe was at its peak, and it seemed that someone somewhere might light
the blue touch-paper at any moment.
But he also knew that any gesture of support for America would be
looked upon with something less than enthusiasm by the large and
vociferous element in his own party which was doctrinally opposed to
anything the US did.
Publicly, he supported the broad principle of US military aid to the
embattled Republic of South Vietnam. Privately, he resisted powerful
behind-the-scenes pressure to send in British troops as a gesture of
more tangible assistance.
LBJ's astute Secretary of State Dean Rusk, a renowned Anglophile, once
lamented that all that was required was commitment of ''a battalion of
the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders'' as a demonstration of Western
solidarity.
Wilson continued to duck and dive on the question of intervention. LBJ
became ever more frustrated by his tactics.
Britain's response was to launch a series of peace initiatives, in an
effort to bring the protagonists to the negotiating table. All failed,
principally because Moscow short-circuited diplomatic efforts at every
turn.

QUITE a lot hangs on the entrepreneurial success of Mainetti (UK) Ltd,
the winner of this month's Trailblazer Award.
As the employer of 350 people in Jedburgh, it's a major source of
income to a large number of households in that historic Border town; as
a company whose annual turnover approaches #50m, it's a significant
contributor to the Scottish economy; and as the manufacturer of over 170
million garment hangers annually it provides plastic shoulders on which
to hang some 40% of all garments sold in the High Street.
Mainetti (UK) Ltd is Europe's largest supplier of garment hangers, and
this month the company won the contract to supply 40 million Top Hangers
to Marks and Spencer -- the largest single hanger contract in the UK.
The company is Scotland's largest PVC user and has invested heavily in
plant and equipment. Over #6m has been invested over the last two years
in order to produce new hangers in up-to-date designs and #1m has been
invested in the Hawick extrusion plant.
The history of Mainetti (UK) Ltd goes back 20 years. In 1975 five men
got together; Mackie Robertson, who wanted to start making plastic
hangers; Jack Kelly, an industrial chemist for Uniroyal; and the three
Mainetti brothers, who were involved in plastic moulding technology in
Italy. Jedburgh, where the recent closure of an old British Rayon plant
meant there was a good pool of skilled labour, seemed the ideal site.
0 Today Mainetti (UK) Ltd is part of Mauna Holdings, a multinational
based in Holland. Since Kelly's retiral three-and-a-half years ago, it
has been led by McIntosh.
In 1986 Mainetti established a recycling plant for hangers. This
separates out the metal hook and any paper stickers from returned
hangers, and turns the residue into recycled polystyrene.
In 1992 Mainetti acquired its main supplier of tooling, Yates (Tools)
in the west Midlands, which supplies Mainetti and makes money in its own
right. Two-thirds of its capacity goes to manufacture high-precision
mould tools.
Ten years ago the company started using its plastic extrusion
technology to produce lengths of tubing through which telecommunications
cable was passed. Now Mainetti is the leading UK supplier of cabling
ducts for the cable and telecommunications industry.
Yet another recent diversification has been into the supply of
Microduct to BT. In 1993 Mainetti won the contract, worth about #2.5m,
to develop a mechanism to blow fibre or cable along a length of tubing.
The old Slumberdown factory in Hawick has been taken over to produce it.
What impressed John Ker of Ernst and Young was the company's very
strong business performance with future growth always being actively
pursued. At the moment McIntosh is strongly targeting overseas markets,
particularly the Far East; its vital and expanding contribution to the
Borders economy; the superior quality of its products; its position in
the van of the super information highway; and its strong management
team.

A felt-tipped pen and defaced logos led to the making of a golf legend
reports Ron Marshall
EVEN your rabid sports trivia fan might be flummoxed by this one --
what did Faldo, Langer, Woosnam, and Lyle all have in common at golf's
1987 Ryder Cup in Dublin, Ohio?
Answer -- they all used a black felt-tipped pen to deface the Glenmuir
diamond-shaped logo on the sleeve of their Ryder Cup sweaters.
That little gem, and the explanation for the action, came to light
during a chat with the sales director of Glenmuir Limited, the
Lanark-based knitwear firm with a success story of rocketing sales in
the last dozen years. It's also one of seven sportsgoods companies under
the corporate umbrella of Grampian Holdings.
Jim Thomson, who comes from another knitwear centre, Hawick, has been
responsible for opening up many of the golfing avenues for Glenmuir's
garments -- sweaters and shirts, and from a target turnover of #400,000
in 1983 the staggering figure this year is #7.6m.
The Ryder Cup connection has been vital -- plus the essential customer
support service established in the mid-80's (main outlets are golf
professionals' shops and sports goods stores).
Having been suppliers of crested sweaters to the Belfry golf courses
near Birmingham before the biennial competition was first played there
in 1985, Glenmuir were approached in some desperation by the PGA just
weeks before the 1985 event. Could they provide, urgently, 300 sweaters
for tournament stewards because the then official suppliers couldn't
make the deadline?
Happy to oblige, Glenmuir were then asked by the official
merchandisers for 2000 Ryder Cup-crested sweaters. They, too had been
let down by the suppliers.
Having pulled out all the stops Glenmuir were rewarded with the cachet
of official suppliers for 1987 in Dublin, Ohio. And that's where the
felt-tip trouble began.
''The four players we mentioned,'' recalls Thomson, ''were contracted,
through the Mark McCormack organisation IMG, to other knitwear
manufacturers. IMG insisted that their four players should black out our
sleeve logo, not only for the competition but even for the official team
photo. But you know, we got more publicity from people in America than
if the logo had been in full view.''
The only disappointing upshot from the incident was that future Ryder
Cup contracts have prevented the sleeve logo being included. ''People in
the business know we're the official suppliers these days but maybe the
general public don't. We're allowed one advertisement immediately after
the Ryder Cup but no more.''
The factory, big but hard to find even in a town the size of Lanark,
employs just under 200, around 70% of them women. State-of-the-art
knitting machines rattle up the most complex of intarsia patterns and
textured weaves. Fronts, backs, sleeves, cuffs and welts (the raised
waistline part) are all made up separately then magically brought
together by skilled staff. There then seem to be checks galore --
examiners inspect work that's already been examined -- and there's still
a final check before the crest is applied by computerised tape. (around
2000 lie on shelves in the embroidery section).
This year 300,000 garments (sleeved and sleeveless sweaters) will be
manufactured by Glenmuir (they import 150,000 shirts, ready made and
crested, from the Far East and Peru), and about 30% are for export.
Ireland is by far their main customer (the Ballybunion club alone
accounts for sales of #200,000), followed by France, Germany, Spain, and
Sweden.
Linked with this sucess story is a continuing close relationship with
professional golf's governing bodies. Glenmuir have sponsored the
British club professional championship since 1993 -- that costs around
#100,000 a year -- and have become the PGA's first sponsors into the
next millenium, guaranteeing support for the championship till 2001.
Probably their best known contracted player is Sam Torrance, whose
bonus from Glenmuir, if he ever wins the Open Championship, runs well
into five figures. In fact the company's first named player, the
Australian Rodger Davis, came close to picking up just such a bonus, in
1979, when he was well placed in the Open but latterly slipped to fifth.
And the winner that year? A 22-year-old lifting his first major title,
Seve Ballesteros.

THE full-year results to March 31 from Barrow-based shipyard VSEL
yesterday, in line or perhaps a shade better than expected, were
regarded as largely academic as share markets awaited the next move from
bidders GEC and British Aerospace.
VSEL's shares, which had soared 80p on Tuesday after President of the
Board of Trade Michael Heseltine gave the green light -- regarded as
certain for BAe and less so for GEC, dipped 10p to stand at 1773p.
Reporting pre-tax profits up 5.7% from #61m to #64.5m, VSEL said it
would be premature at this stage to make further commment on the outcome
of the MMC enquiry but that the board would provide appropriate advice
to shareholders in due course.
BAe said it was evaluating whether to re-bid for the nuclear submarine
and warship builder.
VSEL had already announced that it was to pay a second dividend, in
lieu of a final, of 30p a share, up from 23.5p, taking the total from
34p to 42p. This decision was made because of uncertainties over the
timing of any new offer for the company.
Meanwhile, it said its profits increase resulted primarily from a
substantial net cash inflow during the year. This increased cash
balances and short-term deposits at March 31 to a net #411.3m from
#322.1m in 1994, improving net interest receivable by 36.6% from #10.1m
to #13.8m.
VSEL's current workload continues to be dominated by the Trident
contracts which account for the majority of the company's profits.
Looking ahead, substantial resources are being expended in preparing its
tender submissions to the Ministry of Defence for the design and build
of the Batch Two Trafalgar Class submarines and the Landing Platform
Dock ships.
With its strong balance sheet, dominated by more than #400m in cash,
an order book in excess of #1500m and good prospects for new orders for
submarines, surface ships and the export of defence equipment, the
company looks forward to the future with confidence -- presumably either
as part of GEC or BAe.

THE Chelsea Flower Show is considered to be the first event of the
English summer social season. But I went along to the Chelsea Flower
Show on Tuesday as someone who is interested in gardening rather than
wanting to appear in the social columns of glossy magazines.
In the past, gardening has often been seen as a pastime for the
elderly, but judging from the queue of people, of all ages and
nationalities, that formed 10 minutes before the turnstiles opened, its
appeal is universal. Indeed membership of the Royal Horticultural
Society has risen by 100,000 over the past 10 years to 190,000 today.
The thing about shows like the Chelsea Flower Show is that it shows up
your gardening inadequacies. You come back filled with all sorts of
great ideas for designer planting schemes and floral displays, and
convinced that you must have the latest trendy gadget for doing all
sorts of jobs which are probably easier done by hand.
Much the same happens with trips to show houses and interior design
exhibitions. Somehow you never seem quite able to reproduce the same
effect at home. In the case of the Chelsea Flower Show this may not be
surprising because some of the displays in the show gardens are not
meant to be copied in a ''real'' setting. This has sparked controversy,
prompting an explanatory entry in this year's catalogue. In much the
same way as couture fashion shows often have little in common with the
reality of what people wear, so some of the exhibits are meant to
stimulate the imagination and provide entertainment rather than be
copied.
Just as it pays not to take too much notice of style pundits in
magazines telling us what is a ''must have'' for the current season, so
the same can be said for many gardening commentators. Apparently,
astilbes and hostas were last year's ''in'' plants and they have been
superceded this year by the euphorbia. I prefer a more anarchic approach
to gardening and largely ignore the rules about what colours and plants
are deemed appropriate. This makes it all the more satisfying when
something turns out to be just right for the setting.
Gardening can cost as little or as much as you like. In much the same
way as doing up a flat or house, the best effects can be achieved for
remarkably little cash outlay. However, whereas you can often live with
the streaky paintwork or uneven shelves that follows many a bout of DIY,
plants are less accommodating, at least the ones I have. If not tended
to carefully they can so easily curl up and die.
I have started to grow many of my plants from seed. This is partly for
financial reasons as it can become prohibitively expensive to stock an
entire garden with plants from a garden centre or nursery. In addition
it is possible to grow all sorts of interesting plant varieties,
particularly in single colours, that you do not come across in your
normal garden centre. In my case this has involved growing some wild and
old cottage flowers.
A tentative vegetable patch is trying to emerge from the weeds in my
garden. My asparagus came through this year and I was so pleased that I
did not know whether to devise a special dinner party to celebrate or
whether to leave it in the ground as evidence to my disbelieving friends
of my gardening prowess. There is no doubt about picking the herbs.
These are needed to reproduce my favourite Italian recipes to remind me
of my forthcoming summer holiday.
I imagine gardening is a bit like raising children. You nurture the
young in the hope that they will grow up to be something you can be
proud of. In my case I have high hopes for my five new orange Geranium
Appeal plants. I planted a packet of six seeds, of which five decided to
grow. They have had pride of place on the kitchen window sill, had the
best liquid feeds and lots of encouraging chats and that all-important
''quality time''.
For those of us who live in the city, gardening is an excellent way of
capturing some of the best qualities of the countryside, such as smells
and wildlife. Foxes, newts, frogs, butterflies, woodpeckers, owls, bats,
and a heron visit my garden, and in the past we have been told of a
badger set at the bottom of the garden.
When the sun is shining and you sit in the garden with a glass of
something cold, and preferably sparkling, listening to the birds, it is
quite possible to imagine you are in the depths of the countryside.
However, to get the maximum out of a garden takes a lot of time and
effort, something which is not compatible with full-time work. Roll on
National Lottery. Some of this week's jackpot of around #17m would come
in quite handy in the garden, but I am not holding out too much hope
given my past record. But that's another story.

DO YOU get a sense of achievement, growth, and recognition at work? Do
you feel you are valued, involved, challenged, interested, enthusiastic,
and committed? Or do you have a sense of frustration, defeat, and
invisibility? Do you feel you are untapped, restrained, caged, cynical,
and uncommitted?
I wonder which of these mind sets prevails in the collective
consciousness of the country on Monday mornings.
As one management guru asks: ''What sort of hell-holes have managers
created?'' What have they created that makes people want to switch off
their minds at the factory or office door, and puts them into overdrive
when they leave?
I believe two parts of the problem to be the way managers
traditionally see their function in life, and the way that organisations
are structured in rigid and hierarchical layers, providing narrow job
descriptions and inhibiting team work and ownership of issues.
The traditional management paradigm (a framework of assumptions and
beliefs about the way things are and should be) is based on ''control''.
Managers believe their functions in organisations are primarily to
organise, plan, regulate, enforce, authorise, approve, monitor, oversee,
evaluate, solve problems, and troubleshoot.
In an organisation imbued with the control paradigm, information on
the work process flows up from workers or the process. In the control
paradigm, management solve problems and make decisions, not the
workforce. Managers are responsible and accountable, not the workforce.
The workforce is therefore frequently not as committed to the solutions
and decisions as they might be.
A new management paradigm is required, one which believes that the
function of managers is to support and empower the workforce to achieve
whatever the organisational objectives are.
So what does this empowerment look like?
Not the so-called empowerment that some organisations have developed,
where the main, if not the only purpose, is to reduce costs, staff
numbers, and force people to do more of what they are doing.
The empowerment that I envision means more emphasis on communication,
and the clarification of organisational goals and values. There is more
emphasis on continuous training and development for managers and all
employees.
The empowerment that I envision means a change in the management
paradigm so that managers see their role changing to that of leader,
motivator, facilitator, coach, educator, and communicator. Management is
charged with encouraging creativity, problem solving, innovation, and
team working.
This new empowering paradigm means moving from being in authority to
being an authority.
When organisations implement the empowerment that I envision, it
produces hard results. Increased productivity, lower production costs,
lower defect rates, improved quality and improved customer service --
some of the world's leading companies pay testimony to this.
So, why are more companies not going for the empowerment route?
In my view, the biggest block is lack of understanding and management
fear.
Managers do not understand what empowerment means. Their vision is
coloured by those exploitative attempts I mentioned earlier.
Managers fear the role changes they will be required to go through.
They fear that they will lose power and be seen as redundant in their
new role. Managers also fear the high-energy levels that can be created
by people working in teams. New ideas, new methods, new procedures,
change, change and more change.
The problem is that managers who view the world through the control
paradigm have a fear of not being in control of these higher energy
levels.
Consequently, they believe, more mistakes will happen and things will
fall apart.
I challenge all managers to re-create organisations and re-educate
themselves and their employees to move away from the hell-holes that we
call work in the latter part of the twentieth century.

A FORLORN looking ''Chicago-esque'' building in Glasgow could soon be
restored to its former glory, writes Stewart McIntosh. Built around 1930
by the prominent architect James Millar, the former Commercial Bank
building at 92/98 West George Street has been rather neglected in recent
years and its slim, clean lines have faded under layers of grime.
Developers Cityprop Ltd have just acquired the building from the Royal
Bank of Scotland in a #900,000 deal and intend to carry out
improvements.
''We've applied for consent to clean the stone and bring the whole
exterior back up to scratch.
''Hopefully, within about six months the building will once again be a
prominent feature of the city centre,'' says Eric Johnston of Cityprop.
The 17,000 sq ft building contains an impressive double-height banking
hall at ground level with six floors of offices above.
Eric Johnston, adds that its excellent location should attract small
professional firms to the stone cleaned and refurbished offices, while
the dramatic banking hall might serve as a new city-centre wine bar or
restaurant.

RAW material costs continue to be a cause of concern for the chemical
industry and are expected to remain so for the forseeable future. For
example, the price of acrylo nitrile has has almost trebled in recent
months to $1800 a tonne and pulp prices have doubled to around $1000 a
tonne.
This is putting downward pressure on margins. Courtaulds reported
annual results showing profits before tax and exceptionals up 3% to
#151m. However, trading profits before exceptional items were down 5%.
Total sales were 7% higher with acquisitions contributing #165m. The
dividend is raised by 4.1% to 15.4p after a final payment of 11.25p net.
The group's fibres and chemicals division was the worst affected by
the higher raw material costs, particularly after the summer. Its
margins dropped to 9.3% from 12.8% and profits fell by #9m to #84m. The
polymer products activities saw profits decline by #4m to #28m with
margins dropping to 8.3% from 9.1%.
On the plus side, its coatings and sealants division increased its
profits by #2m to #64m with steady margins, helped by strong demand in
the Far East.
Courtaulds has had some success in diversifying its sources of supply
of pulp in an effort to alleviate the pressure of the steep price rises.
It used to have a sole supplier, Sapi of South Africa, but is now also
buying from Brazil. It needs about 300 tonnes of pulp a year and 200,000
tonnes of acrylo nitrile.
The company still has a target of 10% margins although it achieved
slightly below 8% last year. Its chief executive Sipko Huismans is
confident its margins will recover once raw material costs stop rising.
However, he expects a six-month lag between increased raw material
prices and higher selling prices.
Group cashflow improved despite the pressure on margins and working
capital. Capital expenditure rose in the year to #182m with further
spending on the Tencel plant in the Far East. Gearing rose to 37% (30%)
but interest cover improved to six times earnings from 4.2 times the
previous year.
The results were in line with City forecasts. Courtaulds shares have
enjoyed a good run since May 11 when they closed at 443p. Yesterday they
added a further 14p to 477p where they yield 4%.

THE privatisation of Irvine's property portfolio in a #27m deal marks
a major milestone in the disposal of Scotland's public sector commercial
property assets. The success of the sales programme brings both threats
and opportunities for new town tenants -- the threat of higher rentals,
and the opportunity (in many cases) to buy their premises from their new
landlord.
The purchase by the southern-based Ashtenne Group of the Irvine
industrial stock is Scotland's biggest new town property sale to a
single bidder.
The 1.38 million sq ft portfolio comprises: six industrial estates,
three workshop developments, part of the upmarket Riverside Business
Park, and 50 acres of industrial land. Ryden, who handled the sale for
Irvine Development Corporation, received several bids. The successful
purchaser was represented by Drivers Jonas and the deal follows other
major sales in East Kilbride, Cumbernauld, Livingston, and Glenrothes.
Jim Shankland, managing partner in Ryden's Glasgow office, said: ''The
level of interest in this sale is testament to the quality of Irvine's
industrial assets. Ashtenne is investing in a town with an established
economy and quality estates with the potential to achieve an excellent
return.''
Ashtenne has invested some #94m in Scottish property over the last
five years and is now a major player in the industrial sector, along
with the Highcross Group and Caledonian Land.
Between them these three companies now own the lion's share of
Scotland's industrial property, yet only five years ago most of the
property was in public ownership where rentals were generally kept low
to stimulate employment.
The new players are unlikely to be so generous, and many tenants can
expect rental increases at their next review. But, in the longer term,
tenants will be beneficiaries of the privatisation process, according to
David Murdoch of surveyors Chesterton. ''The new town development
corporations were sometimes rather inflexible in their letting policies.
The new landlords will allow tenants the chance to buy their properties,
if they wish,'' he said.
Scotland's industrial rentals are still low, mainly in the #2 to #3.50
per sq ft range. Any private developer considering a speculative scheme
would need a rental of #4.50 to #5.50 per sq ft to get a return. In
short, speculative industrial development does not stack up for the
private sector. Apart from the Lanarkshire Enterprise Zone where there
are special tax breaks, there is virtually no industrial development
going on in Scotland at the moment.
Now that the public sector assets have been sold (with the exception
of some key sites retained by Scottish Enterprise for potential inward
investors) Scotland faces an imminent shortage of the new industrial
properties. It was the ready availability of such premises which
attracted so many inward investors from the USA, Japan, Germany and
elsewhere over the last 20 years.

WHATEVER else British parliamentarians do in their spare time -- and
some of them do plenty -- their greatest gift to the world is the
ability to invent weasel-like phrases. Thanks to one of the greatest
parliamentarians of all time, we can now accuse someone of
''terminological inexactitude'' (in other words, lying) and get off
without a punch in the mouth. Thanks to an outstanding Cabinet
Secretary, we can now admit to ''economy with the truth'' (in other
words, not exactly lying) and maintain a face-saving sang-froid.
So I was lost in admiration this week by the way the Tory MP Sir Jerry
Wiggin spat the hook from his mouth like a prize trout, and swam off
into the reeds. His statement in the Commons over the dubious Gas Bill
amendment venture said he acknowledged his action ''was at odds with the
proper expectations of the House''. The serpentine elegance of the
phrase hit me like a cosh. It was, I realised, another great entry for
the lexicon of useful semantic branch-lines.
I thought I'd try it out last night in McSonachan's. The Braces, who'd
had a hard day, had partaken rather too much of strong ale and had begun
to cast aspersions on the football club which I support (serious
slanders which I secretly share at the end of another inglorious
season). That, however, isn't the point. I lifted The Braces' glass and
poured the rest of the pint over his head. McSonachan was on the spot in
a trice. A short conversation followed.
Him: ''Here, whit d'ye think ye're daein', ye bampot?''
Me: ''I fuly acknowledge that my action was at odds with the proper
expectations of this pub.''
Him: ''Does this mean you're sorry or what? Does that mean you're an
idiot? Does that mean you'll clean up the mess? Does that mean you'll
never do it again?''
Me: ''There was no intention to pour beer over my friend's head but I
accept my actions were open to other interpretations and I wish to
apologise to the pub with reservation for any harm this may have done to
its reputation.'' Then I sat down. The debate continued on these lines:
Doughnut Dave (Large Bell's, Bishopbriggs): ''Point of order here.
D'ye think ye can get away with it that easily?''
Pickled Egg Pete (Four Largers, Shettleston East): ''It is my view
that your statement disposes of this unpleasant matter and no interests
of the pub would be served by a reference to McSonachan.''
Me: ''Fine. Set them up again McSonachan, and one for yourself.''
You've no idea how good I felt after this. If you study Hansard you can
wriggle out of almost anything. And, at the cost of a bottle of shampoo
and one dry-cleaning bill, The Braces is still my best pal.
TWO pieces of good news made us feel despondent at our office break in
the Nerd House commissariat. One was the theory that if smokers gave up
cigarettes, they could create 155,000 jobs in catering, sports, museums,
theatres, and cinemas.
As she combused low-tar, Ms Angelica Banana-Skyne, the High
Whitecraigs polymath, said she was outraged by the suggestion. ''We
smokers are caught between two lobbies. One is the health lobby,'' (and
here she coughed delicately to give her statement emphasis). ''The
second is the financial lobby, which tells us how much money we could
save if we gave up the dratted weed. Now they're saying we could spend
it on something else. But I already eat out, play squash, and go to
museums, theatres, and cinemas. What more can I do?''
We sympathised. Then The Braces talked about the heroic operation in a
BA flight from Hong Kong, where a Scotswoman with a collapsed lung was
saved by a surgeon using improvised equipment: a wire coathanger, some
sticky tape, a bottle of mineral water, and some brandy. ''The new
competitive National Health Service is going to love this,'' he said.
''Mark my words. You'll see hospital trusts ordering wire coat hangers
by the gross.''
But, I said, they'll also have to order brandy. ''If it's five-star'',
said The Braces, ''I won't complain.'' But somehow, we felt it wouldn't
be.

SCOTTISHPOWER took a further step to expand outside Scotland yesterday
when it opened an electricity generating station in England.
The #30m gas-turbine station at Knapton in north Yorkshire will sell
its entire production -- worth about #10m per year -- to the National
Grid.
Knapton is fed by natural gas from nearby onshore wells and generates
40MW of electricity -- sufficient to meet the power needs of a town with
40,000 homes.
ScottishPower already operates windfarms in Wales and Northern Ireland
and sells a large slice of electricity generated in Scotland to England.
But chief executive Ian Robinson made clear yesterday that the company
is keen to expand both in the UK and abroad.
''We will be exploring niche opportunities to develop generation
projects outside Scotland,'' he said, noting that ScottishPower was
planning to open a windfarm in the Irish republic.
The electricity generating windmills at Barnesmore in County Donegal
will produce 15MW when they start working in late 1996.
ScottishPower earned #145m from electricity sales to England last year
and expects sales outside Scotland to increase from 15% in 1994 to about
33% in three years time .
But industry sources say ScottishPower has also set its sights on
buying an electricity distribution company in Australia. ScottishPower
is one of four preferred bidders for United Energy, the first power
company to be privatised in Victoria Province.
United Energy, which is said to be worth #400m to #500m, buys most of
its electricity from other generators and distributes it to a population
equivalent to that of west central Scotland.
ScottishPower recently considered bidding for Northern Electric in
England and a US power company, but it has not yet made any major
acquisitions outside Scotland.
The company is beefing up its capacity to deliver Scottish electricity
to England by upgrading the east coast transmission system from 1600MW
to 22000MW at a cost of #52m. Two years ago it completed a similar #85m
upgrade of the west coast link.
ScottishPower also has a separate plan to build a #175m under-sea
power link from Scotland to Northern Ireland, which is awaiting the
outcome of a planning inquiry.
The company will launch a fresh raid into England on Friday when it
opens a new retail outlet in Ipswich in Norfolk. This will bring its
total number of superstores in England and Wales to 49.

Ian McConnell discovers a course on leadership run by a former
aircraft executive based on the 'no pain, no gain' philosophy
'A good consultant should make you feel comfortable'
FAST-TALKING American Errol Alexander likes to make business people
feel uncomfortable. But Alexander, who earned his spurs in the US
aerospace industry, maintains it is all for their own good.
His brash approach doesn't come cheap. Delegates attending the
two-and-a-half-day residential masterclasses run by his Dunblane-based
Profiles Consulting Group pay #1000 for the privilege.
''A good consultant should make you uncomfortable. The moment they
don't make you uncomfortable, something is wrong. That means you don't
need them,'' he told The Herald.
Those attending Alexander's courses may mingle with relaxed golfers at
the likes of Gleneagles or Turnberry, chosen as venues because their
hotels offer an atmosphere conducive to learning, but they can leave
their clubs at home.
His students face a gruelling 15 or 16-hour first day. And there is no
opportunity for shrinking violets to hide behind their books like they
might have done at university.
Alexander, who did not make it big in the aerospace industry three
decades ago by buttoning his lip, will ensure they face up to
hypothetical but realistic problems at his ''round table''.
And the ebullient 54-year-old, from Hartford, Connecticut, has no
qualms about turning business leaders' thinking so upside down that they
miss their motorway exit by three miles on the way home.
Alexander, whose Profiles operation has a service office in Stirling
Business Centre, could in no way be thought of as just another
consultant.
However, the content of his masterclasses, which deal with leadership
skills and changing the way things are done, seems to be held in high
regard.
Strathclyde Regional Council's business development arm has
financially assisted some of Alexander's sessions.
Robert Paton, assistant director of Strathclyde Business Development,
respects the wide experience Alexander has gained during his time in
industry and international consultancy, as well as his charisma.
He believes there has been something of a sea change in the attitudes
of small and medium-sized enterprises in recent years.
These businesses, which employ up to 250 people, now have a greater
awareness of the importance of strategic planning.
While they may have been sceptical about the value of any dealings
with the likes of Alexander a couple of years ago, Mr Paton believes the
American is now, to an extent, preaching to the converted.
Paton said: ''I think, as an individual on an interpersonal basis, he
is one that is always ready to challenge normal ways of doing things but
not to the extent that it is very academic.
''His views tend to be well thought through. Although they are quite
innovative, they are very practical.''
He added: ''He is not just another consultant. He is one of the few
trainer-consultants around who is actually targeting this area of the
market.''
Having made his fortune in the US, where he also worked as a venture
capitalist for Hartford National Bank and Trust and followed that up
with running a consultancy firm for 15 years, Alexander came to Scotland
in 1986.
Deciding he wanted to teach, he did a PhD in strategic innovation and
management at the University of Glasgow, where he also taught corporate
venturing and entrepreneurship.
He then moved over to the University of Stirling to set up, as he puts
it, a ''top-flight'' MBA programme.
Alexander points out that he was head-hunted, a somewhat recurring
theme in his curriculum vitae. He was professor of business
administration at Stirling between 1990 and 1993.
The way Alexander tells it, there is no doubting his experience in the
field. Not many people's careers have started on such a high-profile
project as the Apollo Moon missions.
However, Alexander, who had just gained an associate degree in quality
control instrumentation from Ohio State University, was not overwhelmed
during his time as an assistant project engineer with NASA subcontractor
Bendix Aerospace Systems.
As a ''young punk'' with top-secret clearance, he had no hesitation,
on at least one occasion, in telling a top US scientist by the name of
Tinker that he was wrong.
However, rather than earning him the US equivalent of a P45, this sort
of behaviour was openly rewarded by the innovative organisation, which
recognised its value.
From Bendix, Alexander moved over to Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft, where
he was involved in the development of the engine for the JT-9 (Boeing
747) right through from the project's experimental stage. There, he once
again took the bull by the horns.
Alexander ran the engineering field complaint section. He describes
his move into internal consultancy for Pratt &amp; Whitney as serendipity.
As Alexander tells it, he was deskbound through appendicitis and his
boss came in, threw a project at him and said: ''Don't you just sit on
your ass all day. Follow this up.''
When a plane got into trouble, it was taking 15 days to achieve a
''closed loop'', from finding the fault to deciding how serious it was
and whether a re-inspection was necessary.
Alexander, who empowered mechanics at the particular scene to
investigate, said: ''I got it down to 0.4 -- less than half-a-day. That
is how my reputation was made.''
The American, whose Scottish Profiles operation has seven professional
employees and 17 associates, believes people in business are best taught
by someone who has ''read the map, walked the territory and lived off
the land''.
He believes all companies go through ''discovery stages''. Profiles
aims to help a firm's decision-making unit deal with the current crisis
then move on to a new one.
Profiles focuses on the importance of teamwork within organisations
and is of the opinion that change must be geared towards what the
customer would value.
It approaches its clients' problems as a novice would, after first
going through a diagnostic phase to allow not only Profiles but the
company itself to understand what stage things are at.
Profiles' next masterclass, at Stirling Management Centre, is on June
21.

CARLTON Communications is a major force in UK television, owning the
commercial TV franchises for London and the Midlands and a 20% share of
breakfast station GMTV. Chairman Michael Green is confident GMTV will
make its first profit this year, after reporting a loss of #1.7m last
time. Other investors in GMTV include Scottish TV with 20%, Walt Disney
with 25%, Granada with 20% and the Guardian Media Group with 15%.
Carlton's room to expand its UK terrestrial TV interests is limited
following the Government's recent publication of new simpler rules on
media ownership. Indeed, Mr Green is examining possible investment
opportunities in overseas channels and there could be interest in
UK-based cable and satellite operations.
The combination of a full six months' contribution from Central TV in
the Midlands as a full subsidiary and recovery in the advertising market
was good news for the TV business. It accounted for 42% of Carlton's
turnover and 50% of operating profit in the first six months of the
year.
Carlton outperformed the industry with advertising revenue growth of
about 10% in the period compared with an industry average of about 8%.
Managing director June de Moller said the successful launch of its
integrated sales operation had improved efficiency and enabled it to
increase its share of the TV advertising market.
Total group profits rose by 64% to #120.1m in 1994, ahead of City
expectations. Turnover was #800.6m compared with #658.7m previously. The
interim dividend goes up by 14.1% to 9.3p.
Mr Green said he wanted to build on this performance in the period
ahead. ''Our priorities include adding to our film and programme
libraries, selling more programmes into overseas and domestic markets,''
he added. Carlton is investing more than #115m in original production
for the ITV network this year. New projects include an animated
production of Wind in the Willows.
However, Carlton is not just a TV company but an integrated media
concern with interests in a number of areas. Its video and audio
production and distribution company lifted turnover by 7% but profits
fell by the same amount. Margins in video cassette production were
reduced, but the video sell-through market, which Carlton has more than
doubled over the last five years in both the UK and US, remains buoyant.
Stock write-offs, currency translation losses and soaring raw material
prices impacted on the profitability of the video duplication business.
Pickwick, its budget record and video sell-through publisher, made
another loss and is expected to continue to struggle in what remain
difficult markets. In contrast, film processing has good prospects with
a strong second-half release schedule including Walt Disney's new
animated feature Pocahontas and Time Warner's Batman Forever.
The success of the TV business underpinned strong cashflow. This
resulted in debts of #51m being wiped out in the period and the company
emerging with net cash of about #40m. Going forward, many of the group's
businesses are well placed to take advantage of continuing growth in
screen-based entertainment. However, City disappointment with the video
duplication results pushed its shares down 17p to 942p.
For the full-year Carlton is expected to make profits of between #235m
and #250m against the #190.2m recorded in 1994. Some City analysts
believe that to achieve a constant price/earnings premium to the market
Carlton may need to make an acquisition to boost earnings growth.

Having conducted ''troubleshooting clinics'' for major UK
manufacturing, companies KPMG'S Drew Watson brings back some of the
lessons for Scottish business
MAY is the month of the World Class Manufacturing Conference in
London. The venue, the elegant Waldorf Hotel, used to be a regular haunt
of Lillie Langtree and the fashionable Aldwych set. This time it was the
turn of a group of purposeful delegates from over 70 key manufacturing
companies.
''The world is moving so fast these days that the person who says it
cannot be done is often overtaken by someone doing it.'' This quotation
was delivered by the vice president of a defence company at the start of
his presentation. It seemed to strike a chord with delegates. It also
served as a reminder that World Class Manufacturing is not a static
concept.
I had been invited to run a ''troubleshooting clinic'', meaning that
in the middle of all the keynote addresses delegates would be encouraged
to take a couple of hours to reflect, raise issues, and share solutions.
There was plenty to reflect on. At the end of the first day Professor
Nigel Slack, of Warwick Business School, summed up his observations
about World Class Manufacturing.
''Strategy is a prerequisite,'' he said. ''No matter what set of ideas
you have they must be prioritised in terms of what you are trying to do
competitively.'' That seemed straightforward enough but in reality too
many companies do get into ''new direction'' overload without taking
time out to really think it all through in relation to customer demands.
Reinforcing the point, the manufacturing director of a large
electrical equipment group had spoken earlier of the long residential
weekends he spent with his colleagues working out a new manufacturing
policy. It proved a solid foundation for reorganising the structure,
building new teams, applying best-practice techniques and involving all
in continuous improvement.
It was a lot to go through, requiring tremendous resolve. But, if
productivity is now up 33%, output up 30%, overheads down 12% and
absenteeism reduced from 8% to 3.8%, then who's complaining?
Professor Slack continued, ''creativity and imagination rigorously
combined with the right set of skills and real willingness to learn are
vital''.
Final thoughts from day one? I liked the anecdote used to illustrate
the importance of conceptual thinking. It was about ''whiteboard
companies''. That is to say you are in someone's office to discuss an
issue and within two minutes they have leapt out of their chair to draw
a framework or model on a wall-mounted whiteboard to illustrate what
everyone is thinking. This is a great way to open up meaningful
discussion or as one delegate put it: ''I'll maybe get one for the
living room at home!''
Later on, a delegate from an engineering group commented: ''We have
heard a lot of good 'whats' but now we need to explore the 'hows'.'' I
reassured him that the troubleshooting clinic the following morning
might be just the thing.
Waiting for 15 hard-nosed manufacturing leaders to arrive at your
clinic focuses the mind. I anticipated a lot of discussion around key
customer drivers such as quality, cost, delivery and responsiveness.
After all, getting these things right is the essence of successful
manufacturing.
We decided to agree a list of issues for the group to work through. As
we went around the table, a number of common themes started to emerge:
''How do you introduce major changes and sustain them?'' ''If change
has brought casualties how do you motivate the survivors?'' ''How do you
create the right attitudes and culture for growth?'' ''Why do people
resist being empowered?
It emerged that all five clinics had similar issues for discussion.
Some focused on how to bring about real teamworking principles and
behaviours. Other concentrated on how to overcome barriers to change and
manage the job expectations of the modern workforce.
The overall impression was that people are fairly clear about what
they need to aspire to in terms of the purchasing of systems and the
improvement of processes, but have less comfort in understanding how
they lead their people through it. Those who were winning on this front
gave an important message ''be honest, patient and persevering -- don't
expect too much too soon, real change takes time''.
So at the end of the day how should we do World Class Manufacturing?
The main conclusion was that there is no single route. As one director
said: ''If you follow one manufacturing philosophy, it may become the
way rather than a tool on the way''. To put it differently, no one
should swallow outside philosophies whole, there is something about
using them in your own image, rolling up the sleeves and taking your
salvation in your own hands.
The Lovely Lillie would have been baffled by it all but the new
Aldwych set have seen the light.

Now that the film industry has rediscovered Scotland Harry Conroy
meets a man who plans to pool our writing talents and aim them at the
big screen
ANGUS MacInnes glances out his study window at the wide sweep of the
Firth of Forth and admits its a nice place to live and work. Beautiful
the vista may be, but it certainly is not close to the factory for Angus
is a film actor who, with two other partners, aims to sell scripts to
Hollywood.
Angus can't even use the excuse that as a Scot he prefers to be based
in his home territory, for, despite his name, Angus was born in Windsor,
Ontario, in Canada.
Neither can he point to his partners being Scottish as both Kerry
Napuk and Charles Warn are Americans.
Kerry, a company doctor, came to Scotland in the Sixties from his home
in California, and now works in Edinburgh. Angus arrived in the capital
from Los Angeles with Katie, his wife, in 1986 to open a restaurant.
''I was an actor, and had worked in London and Hollywood, but I was
going through a period of disillusionment. Katie and I had just had a
new child and I decided I wanted to change careers.''
Angus met Katie, who comes from York, while working in London during
the seventies.
''We decided that Edinburgh was the right size and type of city in
which to open a restaurant, which is why we came here,'' says Angus.
The couple opened Mama's Pizzeria in the Grassmarket and Angus at
first enjoyed the new lifestyle.
But last year they sold Mama's and Angus returned to the entertainment
business while Katie began studying business administration.
''For the first three or four years I really enjoyed running the
restaurant but then the administration of hiring people and doing
paperwork got on top of me,'' says Angus.
Since leaving the restaurant business Angus has already played a part
in Judge Dread, which is due to be released in July, and has formed
Scriptpool with his two partners.
He admits that Edinburgh may not be the ideal location in which to
pursue a film acting career or form Scriptpool but says: ''I don't
really want to go back to Los Angeles. My wife and I like it here. I
don't want to disrupt my life again.''
Angus believes that he can make Scriptpool work from Scotland. ''Chuck
Warn is based in Los Angeles. He was the PR man for the Directors Guild
and has been around Hollywood for 15 years. In his job he got to know
everyone, which means that we can get the right script on to the right
desk which is the most important part of this business.''
Scriptpool only became active last month but they expect to send their
first scripts to Hollywood next month.
''The reaction in the industry has been quite remarkable,'' says
Angus. ''Many people have told us that this is the type of vehicle
writers, particularly new writers, need.''
Scriptpool, unlike agents, will take scripts from anyone even on a
one-off basis.
''We expect to see a lot of Shallow Grave scripts. We have already
seen some, and we will see more. Some may be very good but they won't go
anywhere unless they are exceptional.''
It is Angus's job within Scriptpool to decide which scripts should be
sent over to Hollywood for Chuck Warn to put before studios or stars.
''We are looking for good material and not looking for any particular
location. The action can be set anywhere but there is no point in us
sending garbage over as that would destroy our reputation.''
Despite only actively attracting scripts last month, Scriptpool
already has three screenplays and five books which it believes are
possibilities, but it does not plan to put single scripts or books which
can be turned into films before possible buyers.
Instead Scriptpool intends to offer British Collections to Hollywood.
''This means that we will give producers a choice. It will not be a
case that they either say yes or no. They may not want four out of the
five possibilities but accept the fifth.''
Angus, whose experience in the movie world includes playing Gold
Leader -- one of the fighter pilots in Star Wars -- and also appearing
alongside Burt Lancaster in Atlantic City, is confident that they will
succeed in getting a number of scripts by British writers accepted.
''There are a lot of people out there who will have great ideas but
getting their work seen by the right person is really a hard task.
However, we can be the conduit. We have the connections.''
If Angus receives a script which he believes has possibilities he is
unlikely to send it direct to America, but will probably suggest to the
writer that they change part of it.
''I would never rewrite anyone's work, but I may ask people to
strengthen the beginning or end or to build up a certain character
before we think it is ready for despatch to Hollywood,'' he explains.
Angus MacInnes believes that Scriptpool can operate successfully from
Scotland as he points out that the film world is also affected by the
onslaught of the electronic age, which makes the location of a business
less important, and they have Chuck Warn in the heart of things.

LAND Securities may not have produced the mercurial performance of
some of the more active developers, but its demonstration that insisting
on quality will always pay off electrified the property sector
yesterday.
Net asset value per share rose 2.4% to 693p which was above all
expectations and the shares jumped 25p to 617p. That reflected the
City's bearish view on rents, despite there being signs that prime
quality sites are moving ahead, and the fact that Land Securities in
particular had become a victim of over renting. Property let at the peak
of the 1988/89 boom is now having to be offered at much lower rents.
The discount to net asset value has tumbled to 11%. One leading
analyst is forecasting assets of 745p for next March and 808p a year
later based on the shortage of prime property. This is illustrated by
what Greycoat has recently achieved based on rents of up to #45 per
square foot.
However, chairman Peter Hunt reckons that the total shortfall in the
central London office rent roll until 2000 will amount to just #11m
compared with a 1994/95 group rental income of exactly #400m.
Pre-tax profits rose 2.8% to #241m, excluding small asset sales, while
the dividend total has been lifted 1p to 25p for a 5.1% yield.
Land Securities has done a shrewd deal with the Department of the
Environment. It has offered Eland House at a very low initial rent,
which will be fully commercial in four years, to keep the Department in
its crucial Victoria area of London. This is the core of the business
accounting for more than 30% of assets.
The #370m development programme includes stage two of the Almondvale
Shopping Centre in Livingston, while that in East Kilbride has now been
completed.

OLD Firm footballing rivals Rangers and Celtic will be supported by
the same stockbroker if the proposed acquisition of Glasgow-based Allied
Provincial Securities by Greig Middleton's London-based parent company,
King &amp; Shaxson, comes to pass.
Allied Provincial is currently broker to Rangers, while Celtic is
teamed up with Greig Middleton.
The proposed deal would provide the Scottish market with a strong
stockbroker. It would perhaps keep some of the bigger transactions, such
as full listings of companies on the Stock Exchange, north of the
Border.
Greig Middleton's parent company announced on Tuesday that it was in
talks with Allied Provincial, which it said might lead to an offer for
the whole of the Glasgow-based broker's issued share capital.
The proposed acquisition would also require the approval of King &amp;
Shaxson shareholders and of the relevant regulatory authorities.
King &amp; Shaxson, which is being advised by Barings, has entered into an
exclusivity arrangement with Allied which expires on July 14.
The enlarged stockbroking group would have 48,000 private clients and
funds under management of #7300m. It would be the largest private client
broker in Scotland.
With the launch of the Alternative Investment Market next month, which
some brokers expect to attract about 12 Scottish companies in its first
year, the proposed alliance could not have come at a better time.
Assisted by Greig Middleton, Celtic, which has a market capitalisation
of #29m, will be increasing the marketability of its shares by having
them traded on AIM. Earlier this year, Greig Middleton raised #14.4m for
the club.
Shares in Celtic and Rangers are currently traded under ''Rule 4.2'',
on a matched-bargain basis.
As well as benefiting from being part of a major group, Allied
Provincial staff will no doubt be glad to have the support of Greig
Middleton's advanced ''back office'' administration systems if the deal
is clinched.
News of the talks between King &amp; Shaxson and Allied Provincial, which
have been going on for several weeks, followed the revelation that
Hambros would no longer be operating the Glasgow-based broker's clearing
operation.
Allied, which incorporates Parsons Penney &amp; Co, can trace its roots
back to the 1830s and is broker to about 75 companies.

THE world's largest passenger liner, the Oriana, has sent out a
''mayday'' call to Lanarkshire.
Bellshill-based Glencairn Crystal Studio answered the call to supply a
second order of specially-engraved decanters to the luxury liner, after
the first batch the company supplied was sold out on the ship's maiden
voyage.
Glencairn is no stranger to the cruise line market as it previously
supplied the QE2 with 5000 decanters filled with malt whisky.
''The bulk of our decanter products go for export through the Scotch
whisky industry'' said Raymond Davidson, Glencairn managing director.
He added: ''Although currently based in Bellshill, we will be
expanding shortly to a new 5000 sq ft factory in East Kilbride -- the
town where we first started production some 15 years ago.
''Over the years we have specialised in supplying the whisky industry
with decanters designed to the individual requirements,'' explained Mr
Davidson.
They are the largest suppliers of decanters to the Scotch whisky
industry. The decanters are filled with whisky, mainly for export to the
Far East.
Over the years the company has gained a reputation for quality crystal
products. Recently the Scotch Whisky Heritage Trust commissioned
Glencairn to produce a replica of the Jacobite Glass, which was used by
those loyal to the exiled Stuart King to toast his health in his
absence.

THE Aberdeen-based John Wood Group is aiming to boost its current 33%
pre-tax profit contribution from exports and overseas activities to 50%
by 1997. In 1994, profits were #20.5m on sales of #291.1m, writes ALF
YOUNG.
Chairman Sir Ian Wood yesterday said the group is looking at a
presence in Azerbaijan on the Caspian Sea, to add to a portfolio of oil
and gas interests which stretches through North and South America to
Asia, Australia, the Middle East, and Europe.
The group has also decided to invest more in its fire and safety
division, regarded a year ago as a potential disposal. ''We've taken the
decision to grow it,'' said Sir Ian. ''We're looking for more
proprietory technology particularly in the hazard protection and fire
detection areas.''
With the squeeze on margins in oil and gas ongoing, Sir Ian sees Wood
Group's Gas Turbines division, which includes power generation, as the
sector with the greatest growth potential on a 10-year view.
Having built up considerable expertise in industrial turbine overhaul,
the group is beginning to test the aero-turbine market in the United
States and plans a further development of that business, which is 10
times bigger than the industrial turbine market in the UK.

First aid skilfully administered in the first few minutes after an
accident can make the difference between life and death, LESLEY DUNCAN
learns
ASTONISHED and full of admiration, the public has been reading this
week about an extraordinary feat of first aid aboard a jumbo jet flying
from Hong Kong. Thirty-nine-year-old Mrs Pauline Dixon of Aberdeen was
within 10 minutes of death with a collapsed lung when her life was saved
by an emergency operation performed with makeshift apparatus including a
coathanger sterilised with brandy.
Fortunately for Dixon the cry ''Is there a doctor on board?'' had been
answered affirmatively by Professor Angus Wallace, an accident surgeon
at Nottingham's Queen's Medical Centre, and Dr Tom Wong, of Stracathro
Hospital, Brechin. We can't all aspire to being Dr Kildares, airborne or
otherwise, but many people will have wondered how they would have coped
in such a situation.
This week has also seen the appalling coach accident in which 10
pensioners were killed on the M4 near Bristol. Tragic accidents can
occur not just to road or air travellers, or in crowds, but in our
workplaces, our own homes. Would we know what to do -- or would we be
left frustrated and impotent by our ignorance about emergency
procedures?
Some 20,000 people in Scotland each year take the positive action of
doing a basic first-aid course with the St Andrew's Ambulance
Association. This may seem an impressive number but Colin Watson,
spokesman for the association, says: ''It's a very high figure but not
as many as we would like.''
At the association's custom-built headquarters in Milton Street,
Glasgow, I met some of the public-spirited people doing one of two
current nine-week courses. Colin Watson had told me: ''There isn't a
typical person. They come from all walks of life and all age bands, from
school children to retired people, and their reasons for coming are as
individual as the people themselves.''
Six volunteers emerged to practise resuscitation and bandaging broken
legs with instructor George McIlwraith -- who is also first aid duty
officer at Hampden Park.
Ian Ferguson, a 21-year-old computing student and part-time worker in
Boots, is renewing his first aid certificate for use in Scripture Union
holidays. Janice Robinson is a 27-year-old civil servant who wants to
renew her certificate to help with Scout work. Eighteen-year-old Kary
Fergusson is an insurance worker who needs first aid as a Cubs leader.
Twelve-year-old Sam West is here with his mother, social worker Gill.
She wants to upgrade her first aid skills, particularly after an
experience at Christmas when someone was knocked down in front of her.
0 Sixteen-year-old Chris McCormack is still at school and thought the
first-aid certificate would be ''something useful to put on my CV''. He
drew the short straw for practising resuscitation on the dummy torso
''Annie'' -- who ''only comes alive when you kiss her'', jokes George
McIlwraith.
Under George McIlwraith's good-natured prompting, the schoolboy
delivers the kiss of life, checks pulse and chest and is shown the
technique for chest compression to circulate blood round the vital
organs.
Then it's time to practise bandaging techniques for fractures of the
upper leg.
Bleeding from the lungs, we learn, is pink and frothy because of
oxygen, while from the stomach it's dark red. Internal bleeding is one
condition where first aid has little to offer. Expert medical help is
the answer.
Then the class goes on to consider the causes of shock. Whatever the
causes of shock, the advice about ''sensible reassurance'' seems
eminently reasonable.''Whatever you're going to do, say you're going to
do it.'' The idea is to take the victim's mind off his plight by talking
to you. ''You've really got to give the person time to respond to you.''
And you stop people sending for brandy, sweet tea, or cigarettes.
The class are clutching copies of the First Aid Manual, the expert
source of reference for emergency procedures at home, work, and leisure.
At the end of the nine-week course there's an exam with certificates
awarded.
There are 125 voluntary sections of the St Andrew's Ambulance Corps
with about 3000 members throughout the country. You will find them at
all kinds of public gatherings, from pop concerts to football matches.
On October 30 a Breath of Life campaign is being launched -- a week of
free first aid courses. ''We'll be organising free two-hour
resuscitation courses the length and breadth of the country,'' says
Colin Watson. ''In a country like Scotland where heart disease is very
common it's important that people should know what to do if somewone
suffers a heart attack.''
If someone's heart stops there are apparently three minutes to act.
''American studies show it's the person next to you who saves your
life.'' Surely a strong argument for taking up the association's offer
of free tuition.

RISING UK interest rates took their toll on Shires Investment,
knocking the value of its convertible and fixed-interest holdings, but
the Glasgow Investment Managers-run trust believes the top of the rate
cycle is now in sight.
The #94m investment trust's fully-diluted net asset value fell 11.2%
to 252.64p in the year to end-March, compared with a 1.5% decline in the
All-Share index.
However, its yield for Ordinary shareholders of 7.7%, at April 30,
compared well with one of 4.1% on the All-Share. The total dividend is
unchanged at 16.8p, after a final payout of 4.3p.
Gearing of 25%, which adds impetus when the portfolio is doing well,
exacerbated Shires' under-performance last year. The trust, which is
about two-thirds invested in equities, had out-performed the previous
year.

DUNEDIN Worldwide Investment Trust was wrongfooted by the strong yen
and a rally in US equities during the six months to April and
underperformed its benchmark index by 5%.
The trust, managed by Dunedin Fund Managers, shot itself in the foot
by hedging 30% of its Japanese portfolio against a fall in the yen that
failed to materialise. In fact the yen soared, forcing the dollar to
record lows.
A rally in US shares more than compensated for the dollar's nosedive,
but the trust failed to reap the full benefit of this by remaining
underweight in US securities.
Finally, the trust took a pasting from currency weakness in Italy and
Spain, where a large part of its European portfolio was placed.
The fund's net asset value declined by 0.1% to 834.7p per share, while
its benchmark Morgan Stanley World Index rose 5%.
Despite the recent setbacks, fund manager Doug Thomson said Dunedin
Worldwide Trust would not necessarily change course.
''We have significantly hedged against the yen and over the last 12
months this has gone against us quite savagely,'' Mr Thomson admitted.
''But we still think the yen is significantly overvalued,'' he added,
noting the softer trend in the Japanese currency this month.
Japanese equities accounted for 29.4% of the Dunedin Worldwide Trust's
global portfolio at the end of April.
North American equities on the other hand accounted for 26.7%,
significantly less than their 40% weighting in the Morgan Stanley index.
But Mr Thomson said a shake-out on Wall Street appeared likely. ''We
remain cautious on the outlook for the US,'' he added.
The Edinburgh-based fund manager also reiterated his confidence in
Mediterranean markets. ''We are still very favourably disposed to the
outlook in Spain and Italy,'' he said.
The Worldwide Investment Trust had gross assets of #291.3m at the end
of April, including #10m of borrowings and #1.35m of preference stock.

FLEMING Japanese Investment Trust suffered a 16% fall in fully diluted
net asset value to 225.1p in the six months to end-March.
This compares poorly with an 8% fall in the fund's benchmark Tokyo
Stock Exchange first-section index.
With the trust engaged in currency hedging operations in the
expectation that sterling would strengthen against the yen, the
unexpected continued appreciation of the Japanese currency was
responsible for much of the underperformance.

<HEADLINE>Interest rate fears eased by GDP figures Chancellor further vindicated</HEADLINE>

A slight downward revision in Gross Domestic Product growth for the
first quarter to 0.7% compared with the original estimate of 0.8% was
widely interpreted in the City yesterday as a further vindication of
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke's decision to hold interest rates at their
present level of 6.75%, against the advice of the Bank of England.
It means the year-on-year increase is 3.7% against the earlier
projection of 3.9%, and analysts took the view that this further eased
pressure for an increase in rates when the Chancellor and Governor of
the Bank of England Eddie George next meet on June 7 to review monetary
policy.
Along with a buoyant start to Wall Street the economic data helped
boost shares with the FTSE 100 Share Index closing up 35.5 at 3327.3.
Goverment securities too were firm, also helped by continuing strength
in US Treasuries.
The City's view on the GDP data is that it helps strengthen the
Chancellor's hand in resisting any calls for higher rates from Mr George
who is known to be particularly hawklike on inflation. Virtually all of
the data released since their last meeting on May 5 has appeared to
justify Mr Clarke's decision to hold back although the inflation report
from the Bank of England made a strong case for a rise.
The Chancellor had expressed doubts about first quarter GDP after it
appeared to contradict other evidence such as depressed high street
spending and industrial production.
The Central Statistical Office said that the main sources of the
downard revision were weaker agricutural and construction output.
Service industry output remains the driving force behind growth.
Consumer expenditure, which grew by 0.8% in the final quarter of last
year despite lacklustre retail sales, is now shown to have declined by
0.1% in the first quarter over the fourth, probably reflecting the
combined impact of the tightening in fiscal and monetary policies on
household incomes over the past year. Consumer expenditure includes
spending on the Lottery unlike the retail sales data.
The downward revision is regarded as significant in that in an upward
turn of the economic cycle there tend to be upward, rather than
downward, revisions, and it implies that the peak of the economic growth
cycle has been passed.
Goldman Sachs economists say that in contrast to the preliminary
estimates, the GDP data shows the UK economy continuing to slow down in
the early months of the year. The rate of growth of the economy during
the first quarter is now close to the sustainable trend rate for the UK
economy.
But while the downward revision to GDP increases the chances that the
Chancellor will leave base rates unchanged after the June 7 monthly
meeting, (after all, the same arguments he presumably used on May 5
still apply so why change) the Goldman Sachs team still believe that,
overall, there remain sufficient reasons to be concerned about the
outlook for inflation, particularly the decline in sterling and rise in
capacity utilisation.
The Governor of the Bank of England is unlikely to be convinced that
the balance of risks has shifted sufficiently and is likely to continue
to recommend a rise in rates. The actual outcome is regarded as too
close to call.
Mr George, meantime, in the Bank of England's annual report published
yesterday, said he and the Chancellor were united in their determination
to take pre-emptive action against inflation.
Referring to the Chancellor's decision to raise UK interest rates by
1.5 points since September 1994 in response to the Bank's advice, he
said this policy marked a decisive break with the past. He said the
evidence, both from financial markets and the real economy, that the
implications have been understood and indeed welcomed has been
encouraging.

WILLIAM Baird achieved a modest increase in sales during the first
quarter, but the Scottish textiles and clothing group is still hampered
by the rising cost of raw materials and slack consumer demand, writes
ROBERT POWELL.
''Trading for the year to date has been broadly in line with
expectations,'' company chairman Donald Parr told the annual general
meeting in Edinburgh yesterday.
Like-for-like sales had risen 6% during the first quarter, but Mr Parr
warned: ''Trading conditions in European clothing markets remain
competitive with little evidence of sustained growth in consumer
spending.''
''Additionally, the worldwide rise in many textile raw materials
prices represent a continuing challenge for the textie and clothing
industry as a whole,'' he added.
Despite this word of caution, William Baird shares rose 3p to 237p.
Mr Parr said William Baird's recent acquisitions, clothing
manufacturers Melka-Tenson and Cohen, were performing as expected. But
he said they would only make a significant contribution to group profits
in the second half of the year.
Full-year results for the group as a whole would depend on a pickup of
consumer demand in the important autumn season, he noted.
Wiliam Baird boosted its pre-tax profit to #25.1m last year from
#19.6m in 1993 as turnover rose to #534.3m from #522.6m.

The male reproductive system is under attack. Ann Shaw reports that
scientists have linked declining male sperm counts with a ''sea of
oestrogen'' created by chemicals in everyday products
MAN-MADE chemicals in our environment appear to be stripping the male
population of its greatest asset -- its manhood. Male sperm counts
during the past 50 years have continuously fallen, and until now, there
has been little to explain the decline. Scientists suggest the link is a
''sea of oestrogen'' (female hormone) provided by chemicals found in
food, household products and the environment.
The Government has recognised the potentially damaging effects on the
male reproductive system unless something is done, and in July it will
publish a report on the decline of male sperm in the population and its
links with the ''sea of oestrogen''.
The Medical Research Council's Institute of the Environment and
Health, commissioned to produce the document, confirms they are in the
final stages of preparing it, and have now reached the tricky stage of
listing ''recommendations''.
So, what is this ''sea of oestrogen'' we are all wallowing in which is
capable of disrupting reproduction at all sorts of levels, from the
brain to the ovaries throughout the animal kingdom?
Put simply, it is chemical pollution ranging from soap detergents to
car exhaust fumes. The concern is that these environmental pollutants
may be mimicking the female hormone oestrogen, and damaging a male
foetus's reproductive system as it develops in the womb.
The crucial period in the development of an embryo's testes is
approximately between weeks six and 20 of pregnancy, coincidentally when
levels of female hormones are at their lowest in pregnant women. Any
extra females hormones -- or chemicals that mimic their effects --
during this time could disrupt normal development.
Scientists have been aware for some time that the quantity of men's
sperm is falling. From 1938 to 1990 sperm concentration declined by 42%
from 113 million per millilitre of fluid to 66 million. Nobody knows
why.
Statistics show that one man in 18 is subfertile and that testicular
cancer, which has trebled in the past few decades, is a measure of the
damage being done to the male reproductive system. ''Everyone seems to
accept that testicular cancer is increasing but it is more difficult to
accept that there has been a change in semen quality. It's a more
emotional subject,'' said one doctor.
It's not just men, however, who are affected by the increased levels
of oestrogen in the atmosphere. Scientists have reported a shift in the
sex ratio of reptiles in polluted lakes, (animals born with both both
male and femal sex organs) while biologists studying fish in the Great
Lakes have detected signs of reproductive problems. Both report a fall
in the number of fertile male reptiles and fish being born.
Some of the leading research into the oestrogen link is being carried
out by Professor Denis Lincoln and Dr Richard Sharpe in Scotland at the
Medical Research Council's (MRC's) reproductive biology unit at
Edinburgh University.
''It's quite staggering that these chemicals have been around for half
a century and yet we're only just discovering that quite a few of them
have intrinsic hormonal activity,'' says Dr Sharpe. He told The Herald:
''If the current trend continues, I would say there was a cause for real
concern.
''Male infertility is a big problem because unlike female fertility we
have very few treatments.'' A review of more than 60 different studies
of male fertility has found that the average number of sperm produced in
each ejaculation declined by half between 1940 and 1990. Both the volume
of ejaculations and the concentration of sperm within them are falling.
A Danish research team, led by Professor Niels Skakkebaek of the
University of Copenhagen, was able to draw on sperm data from almost
15,000 men of different ages living mainly in Western countries. The
implication of their findings is that more and more Western men are
incapable of fathering children.
Dr Sharpe and Professor Skakkebaek, writing in The Lancet, argue that
the increase in several testicular abnormalities, including cancer,
malformations of the penis, undescended testicles and low sperm count
could all be linked to rising levels of oestrogens in the environment.
They wrote that people may be exposed to oestrogens through foods such
as milk and soya beans, pollutants such as PCBs (polychlorinated
biphenyls), and dioxins which are distributed widely throughout the
environment.
Two of the most definitive studies of male fertility in Paris and
Belgium to date confirm that Western men are suffering increasingly from
low sperm counts and poor semen.
The French study looked at 1351 healthy sperm donors living in Paris
and found an unequivocal decline in sperm counts over the past 20 years
with the youngest men having the poorest semen.
A second study, by researchers in Belgium, has also confirmed
declining male fertility. It found a dramatic increase over a 17-year
period in the number of men producing defective sperm.
Scientists say that much more basic research on male reproduction is
needed, adding that society is conducting a big experiment, exposing
whole cities to very high levels of pollution, especially in Eastern
Europe.
0 One major danger with pollutant chemicals is that many of them can
accumulate in body fat. Other scientists believe it is just as likely
that the use of domestic products -- such as floor polishers and plastic
food wrappings -- are exposing people to increasing levels of
oestrogenic chemicals.
The dairy industry has created cows that lactate even when pregnant
and the milk produced at these times is not only rich in oestrogens but
also passed on to the consumer without comment.
Soya products are a particularly good source of oestrogens and their
consumption has increased considerably in the past 20 years. The
important point about these recycled and ingested oestrogens is that
they are considerably more persistent than the home-made variety. This
effectively means that they are better able to interfere with the foetal
development of an embryo.
All this is bad news for men -- and women too. Is there anything that
can be done about it? Unfortunately, very little, because the current
medical evidence suggests that most of the damage is done in the womb or
during the first year of development.
The long-term solution is to clean up the environment. Meanwhile, men
worried about their sperm count should be aware that having sex more
frequently and wearing tighter underwear -- which can lead to the
overheating of the testes -- could in theory reduce sperm counts but
scientists have dismissed suggestions that these could be responsible
for the observed decline.
There are a few things a man can do to boost a low sperm count.
Showers rather than long, hot baths, and loose boxer shorts, rather than
tight underpants, can help to keep sperm counts high, but there is
little evidence that they have an overwhelming effect in favour of
fertility, say experts.
THE DECLINE OF MAN?
* Sperm counts are declining by 2% each year.
* One man in 18 is subfertile.
* Testicular cancer has trebled in the past two decades.
* The number of men committing suicide has increased from 15 to 16 per
100,000 people in 10 years. While the number of women has fallen from
seven to four in 100,000.
* More men than women are calling The Samaritans. Last year more than
half the calls were from men compared to less than a third in 1987.

The Sixties. Flower power. Love-ins. Sex and drugs and rock and roll.
And Harold Wilson? How could a tubby Yorkshireman whose notion of oral
gratification was a decent fill for his pipe ever become emblematic of a
decade determined to swing?
He took Downing Street at a time when airport police were not
wandering about with sub machine guns looking for terrorists, but
patrolling the observation platforms trying to stop teenage girls
hurling themselves down three flights into the arms of Paul McCartney.
Visually he was all carpet slippers and Coronation Street, standing at
the doors of No 10 alongside a wife who makes Norma Major seem a raging
extrovert. Him in his mac, her in her sensible tweed overcoat. Whatever
was happening on the technological front, the white hot heat of the
sartorial revolution this was not.
He was in still in his forties but resolutely middle-aged with it. Not
the sort of man likely to be seduced by flares, beads, and ponchos. But
then, if your notion of letting it all hang out means centre stand at
Huddersfield Town, that kind of gear might have prompted a pretty blunt
steward's inquiry.
He was not a man of his time in any of these senses, but he understood
the sociological fashions of the age well enough to people his parties
at No 10 with folk heroes from the telly and the world of sport.
People remember his notorious lavender list of resignation honours;
but he was the man who made the Beatles Members of the British Empire at
a time when the Daily Mail was profiling the Fab Four and wondering if
they represented the end of civilisation as Lord Rothermere knew it.
He may not, in the phrase of the day, have been ''with it'', but at
least he knew what ''it'' was and how to harness it to the Labour cause.
And if he didn't exactly gell with the popular culture, he did catch the
popular mood in favour of a new style of classlessness. Renouncing an
earldom and offering himself to the nation as a mere knight was never
going to make Alec Douglas Home into a credible man of the people.
But Harold Wilson was a man of all the people; not least in his
hitherto unfashionable harnessing of the talents of strong, intelligent
women. Kay Carmichael served in his ''kitchen cabinet'' one of the new
breed of advisers hired to keep Sir Humphrey at bay at one level, and
preserve the lines of communication to the real world at another.
Marcia, Lady Falkender, was the kind of high-flying PA who had the
priceless advantage of ready access to power, and the ruthless ability
to deny it to others.
And, of course, the redoubtable Barbara Castle. Many still suppose
Wilson hung her out to dry when their In Place of Strife legislation was
torpedoed by the unions. But at least she had been given that kind of
sexy portfolio in the first place. Compare and contrast that equality of
Cabinet opportunity with the track record of the Baroness Thatcher.
People close to him say the media underestimated his intellect, that
despite his academic achievements there was a snobbish reluctance in
some quarters to assume that he might be possessed of much more than fox
like cunning. In others, of course, his apparent ordinariness leant him
great appeal. Early Essex man probably figured it was no bad thing to
have a Prime Minister who presided over England winning the World Cup
even though you couldn't call that much of a vote winner north of
Carlisle.
The night of the 1970 election I was at a party being thrown for the
cast of Hair, the utlimate in sixties theatrical chic. A friend came up
and offered to bet me the Tories would win. What he knew and I didn't
was that the first results had come in and Labour had blown a
mid-campaign lead of 12 points in the polls. So the end of the sixties
meant the end of the road for the man in the Gannex coat.
But not for long. He won two elections in the space of six months in
1974. Not exactly renaissance man, Harold Wilson. But a dab hand at
political resurrection.

MY abiding cameo of Harold Wilson belongs to that heady July night of
1966 after England had won football's World Cup at Wembley.
Having led Labour to power in 1964 he was now through the honeymoon
period, still only 50 years of age -- and facing the unpopularity which
comes inevitably to Prime Ministers.
That Saturday morning he had flown back from high-level talks in
Washington with President Johnson, himself struggling in succession to
the assassinated President Kennedy.
It was a big day for England. Victory over West Germany in the World
Cup Final would be a major boost for the English (whatever it did for
the Scots!) and it would do no harm to the Prime Minister either.
He was due to attend the glittering banquet after the final that night
-- and that was where I landed in his company, at the Royal Garden
Hotel.
Having sportingly raised a cheer for the Auld Enemy, I was now keeping
a private appointment at the Royal Garden with my newspaper colleague,
the legendary Jim Rodger from Shotts, and his cousin Bill, better known
as Sir William Armstrong, the blacksmith's son who rose to be head of
the Civil Service.
We were there as interested spectators but suddenly it all changed. As
the chanting crowd called for the English team, captain Bobby Moore left
the banquet downstairs and took the World Cup to the balcony.
It was like VE-night all over again -- and Harold Wilson went with
him. The crowd went wild for Moore. Wilson waved in acknowledgement of
the reflected glory.
As they made their way back to the banquet below, the Prime Minister
spotted his No 1 civil servant and came to chat.
''Hello Bill,'' he greeted Sir William. ''I didn't know you were
interested in football.''
''No, I'm just here with my cousin and his colleague from Scotland,''
he replied.
But there were topics to discuss even more important than winning the
World Cup. The two began to descend the staircase, deep in conversation,
with the name of the White House President being repeated.
Jim and I tailed on behind in case we lost contact. At the bottom of
the stair the gents' toilet door swung open and out staggered George
Brown, Wilson's eccentric No 2 who had been celebrating with customary
excess.
''Hello Bill, you old so-and-so,'' he greeted Sir William, repeating
his surprise at his presence.
''Now you're coming into the banquet,'' the jolly George announced.
''No no,'' Sir William protested. ''I'm just having a chat with my two
friends.''
But when George made up his mind, it could be more embarrassing to
resist. ''You're all coming into the banquet,'' he said with sweep of
hand and totally ignoring the ban on anyone resembling a media person.
Before we knew what had happened, we were seated at a table of our
own, complete with bottle of champagne, giving Jim Rodger and I a
grandstand view of a function intended for the semi-final teams plus
dignitaries.In great good humour that night, Harold Wilson was recalling
his boyhood in Huddersfield, supporting the local team in the 1920s when
it dominated English football.
George Brown, a fanatical West Ham supporter, was telling anyone who
would listen that the World Cup had been won by West Ham, which supplied
three of the players, including captain Bobby Moore.

HAROLD WILSON became Prime Minister the day that I arrived at the
House of Commons as MP for Cathcart, in 1964. Throughout the election
campaign I was fully aware that under his leadership Labour had became a
forward looking group of professionals, and the Conservatives a rather
pathetic bunch of amateurs.
Before he took over in 1963 Labour had been regarded as a highly
motivated but rather irresponsible group whose ideas were wholly
unacceptable to business and commerce and to the average middle class
family.
Harold Wilson in the few months after his appointment transformed
Labour into a party which appeared to be sober, responsible, and forward
looking.
He spoke ceaselessly about the #800m trade deficit which had arisen
under the Conservatives, and although this was not an issue which would
worry economists, he created the impression that the whole so-called
crisis was because British industry had become out of date and
uncompetitive and that what was needed was a new programme or national
plan to reinvigorate industry.
It seemed, all of a sudden, that Labour was forward looking and
progressive and that the Conservatives had become old fashioned, out of
date, and out of touch, with the new challenges of international
competitiveness.
It was a masterly performance and Conservatives were soon aware that
they were dealing with a man of real talent.
However, once elected, he had the nightmare of dealing with Labour as
it was: a party bitterly divided and many of whose members were
committed to trade union inflexibility.
Some aspects of Harold Wilson's life have been neglected. As a first
class honours graduate, he was master of the written word and published
12 books starting with his rather optimistic New Deal for Coal, and the
remarkable Relevance of British Socialism in 1964.
He was a master of debate in the Commons, so often I went along to the
House expecting him to be slaughtered on some great issue, but he always
seemed to emerge the victor.
But perhaps his unusual service to democracy was to offer no views on
any issue after he resigned unexpectedly as PM. Perhaps having suffered
the nightmare of Downing Street he did not wish to make life difficult
for those who followed him.

EVERYONE had guessed that reorganisation at Argyll would be costly but
the #195m charge for the Safeway2000 review was greater than expected,
involving 4800 redundancies and substantial store closures largely
involving Presto outlets.
However, chairman Sir Alistair Grant has set some pretty demanding but
achievable targets for the next three years. Market reaction was highly
positive with the shares closing 18p higher at 319p despite a fairly
pedestrian profits performance. That showed pre-tax profits shorn of
exceptional items rising 3% to #375m on group turnover 8% greater at
#6218m.
The sales target is to raise weekly sales per square foot from #12.86
to #15. That compares with the #18 now achieved at both Sainsbury and
Tesco although Safeway has a different store pattern with greater
exposure to market towns and less involvement in the south east of
England where there is high volume movement.
Like for like sales in the last seven weeks have shown an improvement
of 5% as the initial benefits of Safeway2000 begin to show -- Scotland
is doing even better despite the Tesco acquisition of the 57 Wm Low
stores. That underpins the sales target assuming food price inflation of
2[1/2]%.
Significantly, Safeway is doing particularly well in areas such as
children's videos and newspapers where WH Smith was complaining last
week of competitive pressures. Traditionally, it sold chiefly to the
under 30s and single people but is now concentrating to a much greater
extent on the family shopper.
This is the emerging pattern of the superstore regaining its
ascendancy after the concerns seen in 1993 when it was believed the
discounters were about to sweep all before them. It is now thought that
Aldi is loss-making while Kwik Save is seeing volume declines at present
of around 3% -- hence Safeway is to open 34 stores in the medium term
but the 7500 jobs to be created will almost all be from a different pool
than those being lost.
Savings in the medium term should run at about #45m annually, made up
of operating savings and reduced depreciation totalling #70m offset by
some #25m on customer care and marketing -- not that Argyll had that
much choice given the substantial advances being achieved by Tesco and
Sainsbury in increasing market share.
Management realised the price perception was wrong so that customers
thought the shopping basket was dearer than it actually was in
comparison with competitors. Too often items were out of stock and
spending on older stores had been reduced. Also the proportion of own
label was below that of both the major rivals.
Reorganisation is resulting in a much tighter management structure
with department heads being hardest hit by the redundancy programme
involving 3000 people, probably around six or seven per store with their
functions being taken over by customer services and replenishment
managers. The remainder will go from head office and logistics.
The 1800 redundancies from the store closure programme of 20 Safeways
and 104 Prestos will leave the Presto chain with 106 outlets making #30m
between them. The Presto units being sold off made just #3m between them
last year.
Current year profits should reach about #410m which would leave the
shares trading at 12[1/2] times earnings. That is on the back of a
recovery in gross margins as well as higher volume. A Hanson bid is
unlikely as an offer of #4000m would be required, involving a goodwill
writedown of #2300m to Argyll's net asset value while it is difficult to
see what Hanson could bring by way of management skills now that Argyll
has made the painful decisions.
The dividend total has been raised 4% to 12p with a 8.1p final for a
4.7% yield.

process will unleash a spate of corporate activity.
Kellock sees potential for selling financial engineering services to
companies in the province.
Glasgow-based director Peter Burr recently visited Belfast for
meetings with the Northern Ireland Development Board, accountancy firm
Price Waterhouse and the city's leading corporate lawyer, L'Estrange &amp;
Brett.
He said: ''The peace process has really lifted an enormous weight from
everybody's shoulders. You can feel a new buzz about the place and that
really has spread through the business community.
''They are taking a more creative, pro-active approach, trying to make

SMALLER UK companies should not suffer a repeat of the hammering they
received from recession and high interest rates during the four years to
1992, stockbroker Tilney said yesterday.
Director Jeremy McEntyre believes current economic growth is more
sustainable than it has been in previous cycles.
Believing high inflation to be a thing of the past, he expects no
repeat of the prolonged recession and high base rates.
These crippled smaller companies, causing them to underperform the
stock market by 50% during the bleak period from 1989 to 1992.
Mr McEntyre told directors and staff at Tilney's Glasgow office that
smaller companies had outperformed their larger counterparts by 4% per
annum during the last 35 years.
He believes this performance is sustainable.
The four years to 1992, during which base rates rose sharply to keep
sterling within the European Exchange Rate Mechanism, was the worst
period for smaller companies in recent times.
Mr McEntyre, who manages #45m of institutional funds invested in
smaller companies, said he deliberately avoided firms in the computer
software, oil exploration and mining sectors because of their complexity
and, in some cases, the riskiness of their business.
Mr McEntyre has managed these institutional funds for the last seven
years, during which only two of the companies he has invested in have
become insolvent.
These represented 2.2% of his selections, whereas his benchmark
extended Hoare Govett Smaller Companies index showed a 16.8% casualty
rate over the same period.
A total of 176 companies in the HGSC index became worthless between
1988 and 1994.
Tilney's UK Smaller Companies Unit Trust outperformed the HGSC index
by 5.4% during the six months to March.

HAROLD WILSON was one of Britain's greatest ever Prime Ministers. And
I say this having known Clem Attlee, Harold Macmillan, Sir Alec Douglas
Home, James Callaghan, Edward Heath, Margaret Thatcher, and John Major.
As a sports writer I was covering a match at Everton when Willie
Waddell, the former Rangers and Kilmarnock giant, was with me. We were
staying in the Adelphi Hotel, Liverpool, when Harold Wilson, then a
young and aspiring politician, was there.
He was the Labour leader out to challenge the ruling Tory Party. We
had long talks. I was able to tell him that my cousin, the late Lord
Armstrong, head of Britain's Civil Service and then chairman of the
Midland Bank, had everything prepared for his incoming government.
Wilson and myself struck up a great friendship. It was the start of
many political dramas.
I booked his opening meetings for his General Elections campaigns.
Wilson had that soft touch for the Scots. He always wanted his opening
campaigns to begin in Glasgow. That was his lucky omen.
The venue was to be the Apollo Theatre, Glasgow. Sometimes it wasn't
easy. The cash to campaign was not always available. However I always
managed, even with the help of the Tories (unknown to them).
Along with Frank Lynch, the Apollo's owner, we worked out a strategy.
It cost Wilson's campaigns committee only #150 for the hall while the
Tories willingly paid #500 for the price of having Ted Heath speak at
the same venue.
Money was scarce to print Harold Wilson's election address. But I
persuaded a top Tory national newspaper to have Harold Wilson write:
''My plans for Scotland by Harold Wilson''.
They were thrilled to have the story and some Labour propaganda in
their paper. They had no hesitation in delivering it to every home in
Scotland.
And to balance the coverage, I persuaded Douglas Hurd to do the same
for Ted Heath. At that time Hurd was Heath's.
Wilson had a special place for me. When the Scots went to the WorldCup
in Germany, Harold was there as Prime Minister.
He didn't need public relations consultants or anyone else, he just
said ''Jim, will you take charge of all this publicity campaign for me,
your pals in the press will do the job? ''
Wilson loved his football, one of his heroes was Denis Law, who played
for his favourite team of Huddersfield Town before he went to Manchester
City, Torino, and Manchester United.
Wilson's number one in Scotland was Willie Ross, one of Scotland's
greatest ever Secretaries of State. As Wilson emerged onto the political
scene, two brilliant Under Secretaries were Peggy Herbison and Tom
Fraser. Peggy was a miner's daughter and Tom a miner. Both showed their
political skills and went on to fulfil other top posts in the Wilson
administration.
Peggy quit the Government because she wouldn't agree as Minister of
Social Security, to impose the cuts on the elderly and the needy.
Peggy was offered a seat in the House of Lords twice. But she turned
them down and got the post she wanted as Lord High Commissioner of the
General Assembly of the Church of Scotland.
Wilson was always a man on the lookout for new political talent. I'll
never forget the night he spoke in the McLennan Galleries, Sauchiehall
Street, Glasgow, on the plan for Europe.
A young trade unionist called George Robertson, now Shadow Scottish
Secretary, spoke at the meeting. After that meeting, Wilson told me:
''George Robertson will become one of Britain's outstanding politicians.
He will go places.''
It's a sad day when one of the great politicians pass away, but Harold
Wilson has earned a place of respect in Scotland. His record stands
supreme in the history of British politics.

IN a week where the beer giants continue to slog it out for supremacy,
Edinburgh's award-winning Caledonian Brewery yesterday reported
significant advances in its export market, especially in the United
States.
Around 85% of cask sales are shipped to pubs in the Forth and Clyde
Valley, and managing director Russell Sharp said: ''The next 12 months
represents an important consolidation period for our sales at home and
especially abroad.''
Mr Sharp led a brewery management buy-out eight years ago. His team
has put behind them a fire last summer, which at its height threatened
to destroy the 130-year-old Slateford Road malting buildings.
''The United States and throughout Europe, especially France,
represent our export growth areas. America seems to like our bottled
organic Golden Promise and Strong Ale products.
''We are not talking mega volumes. Nevertheless, I expect US sales to
rise dramatically this year.'' A New York distributor has been appointed
to boost east coast sales. Caledonian beers are also popular in
California.

BASS is not going to let Scottish &amp; Newcastle elbow it out of top
position as Britain's biggest brewer without a tremendous battle.
Chairman Sir Ian Prosser said yesterday that he is expecting the
proposed #425m takeover of Courage to be referred to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission.
The last bid of significance was the merging of Carlsberg and Allied
Breweries to form Carlsberg Tetley adding 3% to 14% market share at 17%.
That compares with the 31% which would be the result on the conventional
method of assessing share in the beer market for Scottish Courage.
If the deal goes through, Sir Ian indicated that Bass could also go on
the takeover trail from its present 23% base. S&amp;N is claiming that its
share is would be just 25% if calculated on the brands it owns or
controls while the equivalent Bass figure would be about 22%.
Half-time at Bass results were somewhat better than had been hoped
with pre-tax profits rising 8.7% to #263m. The impetus came partly from
the newer activities such as hotels and leisure as well as from the
revitalisation of the pub estate.
Brewing itself remained under heavy competitive pressure. Overall
volumes were up slightly with a strong recovery in the second quarter as
Bass had not pushed hard in pre-Christmas trading which lost it very low
margin sales.
Take-home business overall more than offset the 1% decline in the pubs
to leave overall brewing profits #1m better at #69m. Tennent's increased
its market share in Scotland.
But as with all the other major drinks companies, brewing is becoming
ever less important, now just 23% of operating profits, even if Bass is
pushing hard in central Europe and China as the new growth areas.
Holiday Inns, there are 1977 of them with about 400 more soon to join
the system, benefited from improved room rates in the US and from better
royalty payments while there were spectacular growth figures from Asia.
Europe was generally on an improving trend but Germany, Holland and
France remained depressed. Unfortunately some of the cream was spooned
off by a weak dollar so that the overall improvement was under 5%.
Bass Taverns are benefiting from the increased food content in sales
but have still some way to go to catch Whitbread. Having sold most of
the low performing pubs over the last couple of years, Bass saw
divisional operating margins rise to almost 20% and profits to #115m.
The star performance came from leisure, up 20% at #42m because of
better results at Coral Racing but particularly at Barcrest amusement
machines.
The #103m acquisition of Robinson's will have no effect on group
earnings in the current half but should be highly positive thereafter to
give some more impetus to Britvic.
The interim dividend has been raised 7.6% to 7.1p. The shares bounded
ahead 20p to 581p despite the prospects of a possible battle for
supremacy.

ALL politicians have at least one quote they wish could be consigned
to oblivion. Harold Wilson's was his assertion in 1966 that Rhodesia's
''rebellion'' against the Crown would be over in ''weeks rather than
months''.
The country's Unilateral Declaration of Independence outlasted
Wilson's own regime. Ironically, it took an incoming Tory administration
in 1979 to oversee the transition to a Marxist government in the new
Zimbabwe.
Wilson was a man of vision in many respects. He was among the first
British politicians to recognise and appreciate the impact television
would have on electoral propaganda. But if he was ringmaster in that
circus, natural cunning deserted him in his negotiations with breakaway
leader Ian Smith.
Having thwarted US intentions to enmesh Britain in the Vietnam war, he
alienated much of black Africa by refusing to apply military force to
end Rhodesia's illegal and immoral seizure of minority power.
At the time, he traded insults instead of gunfire with Smith's fragile
junta. Wilson said that Rhodesia's actions amounted to ''treason''.
Smith countered that he would not bow to ''blackmail and intimidation.''
In the meantime, 220,000 whites continued to hold sway over four million
black Africans.
In colonial terms, a gunboat might have been entirely appropriate.
Wilson, however, feared the reaction of a British public which had many
friends and relatives in southern Africa. Worse, he feared the
consequences of the casualties which would inevitably ensue from
mounting a punitive expedition.
Instead, he instituted economic blockade. Oil was Rhodesia's principal
import. Tobacco and other crops were its principal money-spinners on the
world market.
The sanctions, enforced by British warships, never worked.
Failure to achieve a resolution of the crisis haunted Wilson
throughout his career. It was the major loose end in an otherwise
statesmanlike performance.

* WITH the midge season about to start, if you have not already bought
an insect repellent you might like to try a new one on the market,
invented, developed and produced in Scotland by X-Gnat Labs of
Cumbernauld. It claims its repellent, X-Gnat, is one of the safest and
most environmentally friendly products available. It does not contain
synthetic chemicals and yet is just as effective -- that's the
conclusion reached by the London School of Tropical Medicine which
carried out tests on it. Hamish Henderson of X-Gnat says that the new
product really does work against midges: ''That's how it all started in
the first place. We wanted something that would knock them out but still
be environmentally friendly.'' X-Gnat is available from leading
chemists, price #4.49.
* WOMEN who may have been put off using HRT because of the
contra-indications on the data sheets that its not to be used if you are
suffering from heart disease and hypertension, will welcome the latest
medical move. A committee of specialists has drafted a revised change
which will go to the Medicines Control Agency within the next few weeks.
The new wording is expected to state that women suffering from heart
disease and related conditions will benefit from HRT.
* CHINESE herbs have long been known to be effective against eczema.
Now a further follow-up study at the London Royal Free Hospital confirms
this, according to a recent report in Monitor Weekly, the doctor's
magazine.
It found that even a short course of Chinese herbs helped the
condition. It was emphasised, though, that monitoring of the quality of
the herbs used and follow-up for possible toxic side-effects is needed.

TO some it was the finest flowering of a golden age, a period of
economic well-being for Britain never recaptured since. In the 1960s,
during the first two Wilson-led Labour Governments, national income grew
faster than ever before.
Unemployment stayed below 2% of the workforce for most of the period.
Inflation averaged less than 4% for the entire decade.
Those of us who attended the great Wilson pre-election rallies in
Glasgow's Apollo theatre in 1964 and 1966 can readily recall the
electrifying impact of a leader with vision, calling for a sustained
drive to modernise British industry and embrace the power of the
emerging new technologies. Even business and the City seemed moderately
impressed.
And, yet, from his very first days in Downing Street in October 1964,
Harold Wilson was plagued with two major and related economic problems
which, with the benefit of 1990s hindsight, no longer matter in the way
they did then.
One was Britain's persistent balance of payments deficit. The other,
in an era of fixed exchange rates, was the politically-charged issue of
devaluation as a response to that deficit and the strains it was putting
on sterling.
Wilson came to office with a hugely ambitious agenda for change. He
immediately created the Department of Economic Affairs as a
counterweight to the Treasury in domestic economic policy making.
Within a year the promised National Plan was published. We got the
Industrial Reorganisation Corporation and Selective Employment Tax. The
new government, the CBI and the TUC signed a joint statement of intent
on prices and incomes. The programme was one for a full parliament. But
Wilson came to office with a majority of five.
And, within hours of victory, when the new government had seen ''the
books'' they found the projected trade deficit for 1964 was not the
#400m Wilson had ambitiously alleged during the campaign, but a whopping
#800m. The new Cabinet was faced with three options -- devaluation,
import quotas, or an emergency import surcharge.
The new government's three economic advisers -- Balogh, Kaldor, and
Neild -- were all in favour of devaluation. So was the newly formed DEA,
particularly its persuasive number two Tony Crosland. But Wilson,
conscious of his fingertip hold on power, saw a quick devaluation as
political death. Instead he opted for a 15% import surcharge, a move
greeted with outrage abroad and eventually ruled a treaty violation by
Gatt.
In April 1965, in a speech in New York, Wilson talked of his
government's ''unalterable determination to maintain the value of the
pound''. For a time devaluation became the unmentionable word in
Whitehall, and inside Downing Street itself. Conscious that Labour had
been responsible for a previous devaluation in 1949, Wilson feared
another would sweep him and his party away.
It was, history has already concluded, Wilson's first and greatest
mistake in office. When devaluation finally came, in November 1967,
after a second substantial poll victory, the pound's rate against the
dollar was cut from $2.80 to $2.40. Perversely Wilson's mood by then was
euphoric. It was, some of those around him observed, almost as if he had
been working for this moment from day one.
Using a Treasury text which was to echo on destructively down his
remaining years in power, Wilson told the nation: ''It does not mean
that the pound in the pocket is worth 14% less to us than it was.''
A Prime Minister who had started out believing devaluation was the
worst of all possible evils, now seemed to be arguing it would have no
real impact on the electorate. The Tories and the press crucified him.
Meanwhile, Wilson's battle to wrest some control of the British
economic policy making away from the Treasury was falling apart. The new
ministry was largely staffed by orthodox Treasury chaps. The National
Plan, published days after a second sterling crisis, proved a dud.
The DEA went into steady decline and was eventually wound up in 1970.
George Brown, its first head, was warned by Cabinet adviser Tommy Balogh
against allowing the DEA to be located within the Treasury building.
Brown later recalled: ''He (Balogh) warned me strongly against being
installed at the backside of the Treasury. He told me: That's exactly
where you will end up. How right he was.''
The economic crisis which had faced Harold Wilson on day one of his
premiership came back to haunt him in the run-up to the 1970 election.
After that 1967 devaluation and despite bitter labour unrest over In
Place of Strife, an economic recovery was under way.
Labour was ahead in the polls. But when, on Monday June 15, 1970, the
May trade figures were published showing a #31m deficit (figures
inflated by the purchase of two jumbo jets) Labour's lead began to melt
away.
Arguably Wilson completely misjudged the impact the first bad trade
figures for months would have. He underestimated how effectively the
Tories, under Ted Heath, would exploit them as evidence that a slippery
Prime Minister was hiding the real economic truth from the people.
Wilson, the statistician, was convinced the electorate would treat
that deficit as the aberration it probably was. Not for the first time,
Wilson was wrong. Three days later the Tories were back in power with a
majority of 31. It was left to Tony Barber, not Roy Jenkins, to deliver
a short-lived economic boom.

Diligent, austere, and privately kind Harold Wilson was a political
enigma. The man who promised a brave new world presided over an economic
collapse. Harry Reid assesses a politician who was brilliant in
opposition, erratic in government
JAMES Harold Wilson, a politician who was abrasive and brilliant in
opposition, but shifty and erratic in government, won four out of the
five General Elections he fought as leader of the Labour Party.
This ability to win elections gave Labour the appearance, in the 1960s
and 1970s, of ''the natural party of government'' but the reality was
different. It was during Wilson's governments that Labour lost the
authority, purpose and vision which it is only now regaining.
Wilson was born in Huddersfield in 1916, the son of an industrial
chemist. He was educated at Wirral Grammar School, whence he won a
scholarship to Jesus College, Oxford, where his career as a
distinguished academic economist commenced.
He won the Webb Medley prize for economics and gained a first in PPE.
He then became a fellow of University College and assisted its master,
the great Liberal Sir William Beveridge -- who was to become the
architect of the welfare state -- in various economic studies. In 1940
he married a clergyman's daughter, Mary Baldwin; they had two sons.
Wilson had a quiet war, working in the Civil Service. Eventually he
became director of economics and statistics at the Ministry of Fuel and
Power. Just before the war he had joined the Labour Party. In 1945 he
entered Parliament as MP for Ormskirk, on the margins of Liverpool. In
1950 he moved to neighbouring Huyton, which he represented till his
elevation to the peerage in 1983.
Harold Wilson soon caught Attlee's eye, for he was very much in the
mould of the prime minister: diligent, austere but privately kind,
totally devoid of histrionics, a consummate master of detail. (All this
was to change later when, for electoral puroposes, he adopted a more
couthy persona).
He became Secretary for Overseas Trade and then, at the spectacularly
young age of 31, he entered the Cabinet as President of the Board of
Trade. But he was extremely annoyed when his great rival, Hugh
Gaitskell, was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1950. At this
point Wilson suddenly scurried to the left (for opportunistic and maybe
even spiteful reasons).
He joined Aneurin Bevan in protesting at Gaitskell's introduction of
National Health charges. As Bevan's biographer John Campbell noted,
Wilson's behaviour seemed to owe much to calculation of his personal
advantage, stimulated by jealousy of Gaitskell.
Anyway, along with Nye Bevan, he resigned from the Cabinet, and from
then till 1963, when he became leader of the party, Wilson was perceived
as a standard bearer of the Left (although for tactical reasons he voted
for Gaitskell rather than Bevan to replace Attlee as Labour's leader in
1955).
Wilson eventually became leader of the party, easily beating Jim
Callaghan and George Brown when his arch-rival Gaitskell died in 1963.
George Brown never forgave Wilson; Callaghan took a more pragmatic view.
But neither was to support Wilson fully when he became premier.
From Wilson's point of view, the timing, in 1963, was exquisite. The
Tories were wracked by scandal. They were tired, and had lost the will
to govern. Wilson was to be spared long and debilitating years in that
most cruel of offices, HM Leader of the Opposition.
He seized his chance and invigorated his party, making a powerful
series of speeches on the need to modernise Britain and to harness the
forces of science and techonology in forging a brave new world.
All this might seem trite now, but it was genuinely inspirational at
the time, and he swiftly caught the mood of the nation. He smoked his
pipe; he spoke in a gritty, no-nonsense Yorkshire rasp. He savaged the
out-of-touch Tory premier, Alec Douglas-Home, with devastating
contumely.
This was Wilson's heyday. As the 1964 General Election approached he
excited the electorate with his Kennedyesque call for a first hundred
days of dynamic action. Even so, he only scraped in with a tiny majority
(there is a warning here for Tony Blair).
He returned to the country 17 months later, in 1966, now securing a
huge majority. Paradoxically, this was when everything started to go
badly wrong for him; also paradoxically, given his glittering record as
an academic economist, it was his handling of the British economy which
was to prove particularly disastrous.
He created the Department of Economic Affairs to oversee national
economic planning and to temper the fiscal conservatism of the Treasury.
These were laudable aims but he appointed the mercurial drunkard George
Brown as its supremo, and from the start Brown and the Chancellor, Jim
Callaghan, were locked in bitter combat.
Callaghan's cunning, the experience of the Treasury mandarins and
Brown's inconsistency all ensured that the department became a joke.
Wilson took personal charge of it in a desperate attempt to revive it in
1967, but he had too many other worries by then and the department died,
almost unnoticed, in 1969.
Shortly after Wilson's election triumph in 1966 there was a crippling
and protracted seamen's strike. In office, Wilson had shed his leftist
tendency and he now angrily condemned politically motivated communists
for orchestrating the strike.
Britain was slipping into industrial anarchy. There were serious dock
and transport disputes. The pound was devalued in 1967; many
commentators thought Wilson should have boldly devalued in 1964, when he
first took office, and got the pain over then. Jim Callaghan resigned as
Chancellor and Wilson went on television to tell the people that ''the
pound in your pocket has not been devalued''. Hardly anyone believed
him.
In just three years, his own leadership had been seriously devalued.
As industrial turmoil became more pervasive, Wilson rallied. He and
Barbara Castle launched a brave effort to stifle union power, which was
being generally abused, in a paper entitled In Place of Strife. This was
attacked with rancid anger in the party and -- shamefully -- in the
Cabinet, where the opposition was led by Jim Callaghan.
When it became clear that Roy Jenkins, after Wilson and Callaghan the
most significant Labour politician of the time, would not support Wilson
and Castle, they had to back down ingnominiously. This was a turning
point in modern British history.
Slowly but surely, unbridled union power assumed unparalleled
proportions, which culminated in the Winter of Discontent, which was to
bring down the Government of Jim Callaghan in 1979. (Before then, the
miners brought down the Tory Government of Ted Heath.) The years of
Thatcherism were predicated, more than anything else, on the need to
tame the unions.
Defeated by the power of Callaghan and the unions, combined with the
feebleness of Roy Jenkins, Wilson could only patch up a pathetic and
cosmetic deal with the TUC. ''It was a sad story from which Wilson and
Barbara Castle emerged with more credit than the rest of us,'' wrote
Jenkins later of the In Place of Strife debacle. Wilson had been
humiliated before his Cabinet, his party and the nation.
Abroad, he was hardly more successful. He gave uneasy support to
Lyndon Johnson's prosecution of the Vietnam war but rightly refused to
send any British troops into combat. His attempt to take Britain into
the EEC in 1967 was rebuffed, contemptuously, by de Gaulle. When Ian
Smith unilaterally declared Rhodesia to be independent in 1965, all
Wilson could do was to convene futile talks on HMS Tiger. (The Rhodesia
crisis was not to be settled till Mrs Thatcher took power in 1979).
During the Wilson governments of 1964-70 intrigue and manouevre,
orchestrated by such apparently risible but highly influential figures
as George Wigg and Marcia Williams (the controversial courtier who held
enormous sway within No 10) became rife. The contrast with the almost
puritanical purpose of the Attlee Govenment was all too apparent.
To be fair, in Scotland things were not nearly so bad. Under the dour
but effective sway of his loyal lieutenant Willie Ross, Scotland enjoyed
a good, prosperous period. Ross introduced the Highlands and Islands
Development Board in 1965. This promised more than it was to deliver.
Nonetheless, Ross proved adept at gaining largesse from London. He
presided over two important developments: the Scottish Law Reform
Commission was set up under Lord Kilbrandon, and a Royal Commission was
appointed, under Lord Wheatley, to reorganise Scottish local government.
Ross showed ill-disguised contempt for the Scottish Nationalists and
the devolutionists within his own party. Indeed, Winnie Ewing's
spectacular success for the SNP in the Hamilton by-election seemed to
worry Wilson much more than it worried Ross. Wilson set up a Royal
Commission on the constitution under Lord Crowther; the idea was to put
devolution on the back burner for the time being.
Meanwhile if anything was bequeathed to future generations during
these years, it was probably the expansion of higher education
(following the Robbins report.) Various new universities were
established, including Stirling, which went on to become one of the most
successful higher education institutions in Britain.
The other, very considerable, educational success was the launching of
the University of the Air. This, which soon became known as the Open
University, was to some extent the personal creation of Peggy Lee (the
wife of Wilson's erstwhile ally Nye Bevan) but it would not have been
established without Wilson's personal commitment.
Capital punishment was abolished, but that owed more to an individual
(Sydney Silverman MP) than Wilson's Government.
Yet despite the drift and disillusion, it looked in the early summer
of 1970 that Wilson was going to win his hat-trick of General Elections.
Ted Heath, the Tory leader, was pompous and unconvincing. Wilson fought
a campaign of gentle smugness that flaming June, hardly addressing any
of the issues but instead delivering the couthy reassuring platitudes of
which he had become a master. Yet he lost, and Heath was triumphant. He
had certainly not deserved to win the election, but then the country no
longer trusted Wilson.
Heath proved to be far more incompetent than his predecessor. Wilson
was thus able -- rather to his surprise -- to regain power in 1974.
Heath had abjectly mishandled the second national miners' strike in two
years and had then gone to the country in a fit of petulance. In the
campaign, Wilson appeared to be doing no more than going through the
motions, yet he remained a master of wrecking invective, a supreme
politician -- in opposition.
Heath actually gained more votes than Wilson, but fewer seats. He
tried to patch up a deal with the Liberals' Jeremy Thorpe, but Thorpe
would have none of it.
So Wilson slouched back into No. 10 early in 1974. He (and his new
henchman Michael Foot) gave the miners what they wanted, and for a time
there was a semblance of industrial peace. He went to the country again
later that year, and managed to gain a tiny working majority. This was
Wilson's greatest talent: the winning of elections. He was the first
leader since Gladstone to win four.
Wilson now seemed much older than he really was (59). He was chastened
and he had lost his relish for office. Inflation leapt beyond 25% as the
unions were allowed to control the economy. Then Wilson did shake off
his sloth and he managed to reassert himself; he presided over an
innovative national referendum, which duly endorsed Heath's EEC entry,
though on marginally superior terms; he started a round of swingeing
cutbacks of public expenditure; and -- with the connivance of the
leading union baron of the day, Jack Jones -- a national pay policy was
introduced.
Then, early in 1976, he resigned. The nation was surprised though
hardly dismayed. The Cabinet was less surprised: Wilson had forewarned
some of his more senior colleagues such as Jenkins and Denis Healey. His
last bequest to an ungrateful nation was a singularly perverse
resignation honours list.
He handed over to his old adversary Jim Callaghan, who was duly
elected Labour leader. He stayed on as member for Huyton till 1983, but
he was now playing little part in public life. He was raised to the
peerage as Baron Wilson of Rievaulx, of Kirklees in West Yorkshire, but
he did little to grace the House of Lords.
He did not even attempt the role of elder stateman. He became
forgotten, living out a long evening of neglect. His stock, never high
after 1967, declined drastically. A revisionist biography by Professor
Ben Pimlott in 1992 sought to resuscitate his reputation, and some other
historians began to suggest that maybe he had not been quite so bad
after all. The authorised biography, by Philip Ziegler, was published in
1993. It neither enhanced or diminished his reputation.
It remains a cautionary tale. He was probably the cleverest British
politician of the century, and he was capable of immense hard work. But
there was an opportunistic streak which he could not control; it first
surfaced when he joined the Bevanites against Gaitskell, though he was
not naturally a man of the left.
He raised enormous hopes in 1963 and 1964 -- indeed it is difficult
for people aged under about 45 to understand just how he galvanised the
nation with a new sense of political purpose after what he described as
13 wasted years of Tory rule -- but they were hopes that he proved,
sadly, unable to fulfil.
He was masterful in opposition, but in office he was subject, to use
David Owen's damning phase, to ''chronic indecision''.
During his 13 years as leader of the Labour Party, from 1963 till
1976, he worked manfully to hold it together, yet his trimming and
twisting, his deviousness and his cynicism, did not serve the party well
in the long term. It was, in truth, begining to break apart.
He was in private a most kind and decent man, perhaps the nicest
person to become Prime Minister this century. Despite the constant
pressures of office, he liked of an evening to chat and gossip with
colleagues in Downing St over large whiskies.
He was exceptionally loyal to his friends, which perhaps explains that
apparently perverse resignation honours list. He always got on very well
with the Queen -- much better than either Ted Heath or Margaret Thatcher
did -- and he became master of a populist couthiness that was basically
phoney and mildly patronising, yet infinitely preferable to the stiff
pomposity of his great adversary Ted Heath.
And he could certainly win elections; the tragedy was that he did not
know what to do once he had won them.

IT'S important to distinguish between a lame duck and a dead duck:
Harold Wilson's tart retort to Cabinet colleague Tony Benn's criticism
of baling out Chrysler and staving off, for a time anyway, the loss of
6000 Scottish jobs at Linwood, another 11,000 in the south. It kind of
sums up his political credo.
It was 1975. A year before, Labour had squeaked to power twice, with
more seats but fewer votes than the Tories in February, when the SNP won
seven seats. A second election in October gave him a majority of three
and the SNP returned 11 MPs. Scotland had delivered Wilson from defeat,
just.
Now, a lame duck economy was hirpling uncertainly towards crisis. The
balance of payments deficit, already huge, was swelling like an unlanced
boil. And here was Chrysler threatening to pull out. The Government had
to find #160m for a bale-out or face the social and political
consequences. In Scotland, the implications of inaction, on both counts,
were immense.
Chrysler, like Leyland, was an acute illustration of the fraught
political landscape in Scotland. On one hand, for Labour, lay the
political dangers of letting the dirty industries die. The dire social
costs were unthinkable, then. The economic consequences of propping up
the old heavy manufacturing base were, however, immense.
Politically, Wilson was astute enough to see the dangers to a fragile
minority government from the people his trusted Scots lieutenant, Willie
Ross, derided as the Scottish Narks Party. 0 Centralist planning,
remember, had been the response of successive governments, indeed
permeated Whitehall, after the war. The Labour Government then was
dedicated to expert solutions, controlled from the centre. So was
Wilson.
Wilson the pragmatist, the technocrat, has been written down often as
simply caving in to the nationalist threat by suddenly turning his face
North and offering devolution as a sop. That's too simple. He had, and
it's important, always believed in economic devolution, through regional
development. He held strong to the conviction that Government
intervention was vital to help the ailing Scottish economy.
Until the sixties, and the resurgence of nationalism, there had been
little political discussion beyond the salons of the blethering classes
and the nationalist smoke-rooms, no real political drive or pressure,
for devolution. That changed after Hamilton. And Wilson sensed it.
In 1969 he appointed the Crowther (later Kilbrandon) Commission to
investigate the constition of the UK. It reported in 1973 and the
devolution debate began in earnest.
The legacy of his Governments' regional development include the
Highlands and Island Development Board, set up in 1965; the Scottish
Development Agency; the Social Work Scotland Act of 1968; and the
Wheatley Royal Commission which devised the two-tier system of local
government.

<HEADLINE>Samaritans highlight the plight of farmers</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>978223302</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE desperate plight of farmers living in emotional and geographical
isolation was highlighted yesterday by The Samaritans. The organisation
has launched a campaign, including a video, aimed at reducing the number
of suicides in the country.
It was revealed that there are now two farming suicides every week in
Britain -- with farmers in Scotland accounting for more of the deaths
than those in any other part of the UK.
These statistics place farming in the top three of high-risk
occupations, with only doctors and vets more likely to kill themselves.
The video, entitled The Last Straw, is intended to make farmers aware
that there is somewhere they can go when it all gets too much for them.
''The situation for farmers seems to be getting worse rather than
better,'' said Mary Hardy of the Samaritans' Scottish National Executive
Committee. ''They have to cope with physical isolation, a declining
economic situation, poor weather, the closure of village shops and
schools, and a whole variety of other stresses.
''And even when there are social functions organised in the villages,
they often lack the energy to attend because they are too tired.''
Mrs Hardy said the video was aimed not only at farmers, but at the
''gate-keepers'' -- doctors, teachers and health workers -- to encourage
awareness of the Samaritans' service.
There have been more than 500 UK farming suicides in the last 10
years, which is more than 10 times the number among vets, the highest
risk group.
The Highlands, with its vast tracts of sparsely populated land, is a
suicide blackspot, even by Scottish standards. Recent research showed
the suicide rate among Highland men was 30 per 100,000, compared with
the Scottish average of 20 per 100,000.
Much of the blame for this has been put down to the problems of
isolation. Dramatic changes in agricultural techniques which mean they
can spend days with little human contact worsen this. And experts
believe the additional stress of dealing with increasing bureaucracy and
paperwork is leading to a fear of failure among farmers.
''It's becoming more and more complicated to be a farmer these days,''
said Ian Melrose of the National Farmers' Union. ''It's not about
driving a tractor, but increasingly about providing the very detailed
information the Government requires for payments.
''Farmers' reluctance to engage in discussion over their financial
commitments, and the difficulties they have in servicing that debt, only
exacerbates their isolation.''

SCOTTISH oatcakes, previously virtually unknown to the Parisian
palate, are now in regular demand in the six Marks &amp; Spencer stores in
the French capital following a Scotland the Brand promotion.
Speaking in Glasgow yesterday Jean-Claude Leroux, the food sales and
marketing manager, Europe, for Marks &amp; Spencer, said the six-week
promotion in the French stores had been highly successful. Sales of
Scottish goods, from Aberdeen-Angus steaks to salmon, whisky and
shortbread, doubled in money terms and trebled in volume. Special price
discounts had been agreed with the suppliers.
Aberdeen-Angus beef was a particular hit, with sirloin steaks proving
the most popular line among the meat products on offer. The most popular
food item overall was Scottish salmon, always a good seller in France.
Since the end of the promotional period some items have maintained a
sales level 40% above that being achieved before the Scotland the Brand
effort -- a result which M Leroux found ''phenomenal''.
''In France we are selling a much higher ratio of Scottish goods than
any of our stores in the UK,'' he said. Over six weeks, concentrating on
only 16 lines, the French stores rung up sales of #350,000.
In view of the success of the pilot exercise in Paris, he has
suggested he would be prepared to co-operate in a larger operation next
year encompassing all 27 M&amp;S stores in Europe stretching from Amsterdam
to Seville.
''It was my conclusion as a retailer that this was a very successful
commercial promotion which drew a lot of customers into our stores,'' he
said.
The 16 items involved in the Paris-based promotion included whisky,
bakery goods, salmon, beer, meat and cheese. All had come over as
quality products, said M Leroux.
The Scotland the Brand promotion marked a new era of co-operation
between the Scottish Tourist Board and Scottish Trade International. The
tourist board's promotional posters on the Paris metro and city buses
were mirrored in the store promotions with Marks &amp; Spencer and Monoprix.
George Russell, chairman of Scotland the Brand, said it had
demonstrated how a successful trade promotion could be mounted on the
back of what started out as a tourism-only effort.
David Taylor, director of Scottish Trade International, said there was
a need now to create a small unit responsible for co-ordinating various
marketing efforts which could come under the ''Scotland'' umbrella. This
would be of particular benefit to smaller firms which could not
undertake an expensive branding effort on their own.
That theme was supported by Derek Reid, chief executive of the
Scottish Tourist Board. ''We are a very small nation and we all have
very limited budgets to market our products -- whether it be tourism or
beef,'' he said.
Future promotions may be extended to include areas such as textiles,
financial services, education and the arts.

WHEN I first visited South Africa nine years ago the Mayor of Pretoria
patiently explained why his cinemas required to be segregated. ''It is a
question of choice -- we do not wish to spend our leisure time with
people who are not of our own race and they do not want to be with us. I
don't see that changing in the twentieth century.''
Today the Mayor of Pretoria is black. The apartheid laws and the
segregated cinemas are for the history books.
In 1986 another South African, a high-ranking security officer,
insisted that, when the day of revolution came, he had the weapon that
would repel the revolting masses. ''We have laughing gas,'' he declared,
at which I, thinking he was joking, laughed! He was serious.
Yesterday morning I sat in the sun at the Pretoria Police College and
watched hundreds of new recruits being put through their paces on the
parade ground. They were almost exclusively non-white and many of them
were previously employed as ANC guerrillas.
It is hard to take in the scale of the changes since the first really
democratic elections in April last year. No, not every black person has
a decent house or a job; the townships are vast and filthy, the whites
still have the gold in their safes.
Yet the increased spending on education, the major housing programmes
which have been instituted, the freely available, if sometimes basic,
health care, and the rise in status of all non-whites in the armed
Services has transformed the nature of this country. Much of that has
been possible because of foreign investment.
And Nelson Mandela.
It is almost impossible to overstate the influence here of the
President of the Government of National Unity. Locked up for more than
one-quarter of a century, he emerged unbroken and unbowed.
But it is Mandela's lack of bitterness and his patently sincere desire
to see his countrymen, of all races, prosper which makes him such an
acceptable figure to world opinion. He is not, however, without critics.
The far right, but not just them, are furious that he has pardoned so
many ''terrorists''; he is purported to be soft on crime; in
KwaZulu-Natal, stronghold of the rival IFP, he is accused of breaking
his word on the constitution; why there are even health workers
threatening to strike because they do not believe they are being paid
enough (I seem to recall something similar in my own land).
Mandela, none the less, remains the nation's symbol of integrity and
moral leadership. Sacking his estranged wife Winnie from the Government
simply raised his standing with the former rulers of South Africa.
He leads a country of 38 million people, just over 5 million of them
white. There are 11 official languages, each of them used in Parliament.
Here in Pretoria Afrikaans is predominent, even among blacks who were
forced to learn it in schools. The future of the language is one of many
subjects which cause heated debate -- put clearly the Boers fear
Afrikaans will soon be as widespread as Gaelic.
There is also a strong Scottish contingent in the administrative
capital. Pipe bands can be produced at the first hum of a reel.
I was at a braai (barbecue) the other evening and a chap, originally
from Kilmarnock, told me how much the Scots and the Boers had in common.
''We both have a great respect for education, we are both hard-working
races, and we both have strong roots in our church.''
Well . . . I am not too sure he is quite right about all of that. In
some ways we have a more sophisticated culture, in another the South
Africans have a more honest one.
This is still a rather old-fashioned society in spite of all the
changes. Children wear school uniforms that would be despised by our
teenagers; when did you last see a gym slip? I observe hundreds of them
every morning.
On Pretorian streets, brightly coloured uniforms are everywhere.
Sometimes the immaculately turned-out youngsters will be without shoes
-- but never a school tie.
They do not watch nearly as much television as us, which is just as
well because most of the programmes are fairly awful. Old British series
help a little -- we had Edward and Mrs Simpson the other night -- but
not much.
But there is a politeness, a sense of true hospitality which we would
do well to copy. Service actually comes with a smile.
So I asked some of the expats at the braai what they thought of the
new South Africa, whether they had any dreams of returning home.
''I would not wish to go back to Paisley,'' a middle-aged mother of
two told me. ''We have a life here that we simply could not afford in
the UK.
''Add to that the weather and you might understand our reluctance to
return.''
But I have learned a trick or two myself about questioning people out
here and I casually enquired: ''Do you still have your British
passport?''
''Oh, yes,'' was the reply, ''my husband and I are not going to give
that up. I mean, we think President Mandela has done a fine job, but who
is going to succeed him? When that day comes we may want options.
''Who is to say the next ANC leader will have the same attitude? A lot
of the young people now are worried about standards of education. If
they start to fall there could be an exodus.''
Will there be the good life after Mandela? That is the burning
question in South Africa today. And no group is more eager to hear the
answer than those who hold or have access to British passports.
There are just over one million of them, a thought with which I will
leave you for this week, as I head for some biltong and maybe even a dop
or two. No, I am not translating.

THERE IS no point in pretending I know Ben Okri well. I met him only
twice, and that was long before the Booker Prize swept him to
prominence. He visited my home, drank my whisky, and charmed everyone
who crossed his path during a long and not altogether sober night.
A more civilised, eloquent, and engaging man you could not hope to
meet. Reserved in his manner, passionate about his work, Okri holds a
foreign passport but is, by virtue of his writing, if for no other
reason, part of British society, and an asset to it.
Yet officially he is a Nigerian, a fact which until this week mattered
only to the readers of his novels. Okri's books are dream-like
recollections of a country he left years ago, full of myth and symbol,
mixing his childhood memories with efforts to arrive at deeper truths.
As art, their nationality matters; in the real world, the race of their
author should not, you'd like to hope, be an issue.
No such luck, of course. Yesterday it was reported that Okri, who
lives in England, had been refused a visa to visit France. He had hoped
to take a short holiday there with his family and perhaps do some
research for a new novel. Instead, he was subjected to what he terms a
''ritual humiliation'' and abuse because he holds a Nigerian passport.
Of the embassy staff who dealt with him, Okri said, with commendable
restraint: ''They seem to have a very negative image of Nigerians and
about black people wanting to visit their country.'' That's not what
some might have said.
The French, meanwhile, have responded by arguing that the so-called
Schengen Agreement (named after the town in Luxembourg where certain of
the European states signed a treaty covering the treatment of visitors)
meant applicants like Okri now had to provide proof of a return ticket,
accommodation, and financial independence during their stay before they
could be allowed in. Identifying yourself as an eminent author with a
passport and a letter from your agent is not, it seems, good enough.
What are we to make of all this? Tory anti-Europeans like to claim
that the dismantling of the Union's internal borders will mean a
''flood'' (immigrants never trickle) of unwanted foreigners into Britain
from Europe.
They neglect to point out that while the EU has liberalised controls
within its own boundaries it has simultaneously erected a wall of
controls against outsiders, black outsiders not least.
Two points can be made. One is that Europe is ill-equipped to accept
all of the refugees and aspiring citizens who would make their homes
here if they could. To eastern Europeans add Albanians, Bosnians, Turks,
Arabs, and all those from the former imperial colonies once deceived
into believing they had rights. No-one suggests all borders should be
erased.
Yet against the practical, economic argument can be set another
discourse, no less obscene for being too familiar. This insists that all
of ''white'' Europe, its culture and its ''way of life'', is under
threat. Let our guard slip for a moment and the continent will be, in
the words of Lady Thatcher, swamped. Or so they tell us. The threat,
predictably enough, always has a black face.
Meanwhile in France Le Pen raves, and is listened to, when he talks of
forced repatriation. He doesn't mean white Englishmen who have retired
to Provence; he points no finger at Australian backpackers or white
American students living and working in French cities. Of course not.
Jean Marie's National Front, like its fellow political diseases across
the EU, means only the non-whites, the young Arabs born in France, the
young blacks with the worst jobs, when they have jobs at all. When Le
Pen rants, he does not do so aimlessly.
Thus, a Frenchman of Arab extraction is drowned by skinheads after one
of his rallies and Le Pen says it has nothing to do with him. Thus
Turkish workers are massacred in Germany and the right wing, which
believes the Nazi phenomenon has been ''misunderstood'', denies any
complicity. Thus our own dear racists oppose the European Union, first
because of the terrible frogs, secondly because of the black, brown, and
yellow perils.
Unsurprisingly, all the countries harbouring political racism are in
reality multi-cultural. Were they not, Le Pen and his ilk would be
obliged to harass Quakers or ornithologists. The horrible irony of their
ravings is that they, more than anyone, need the immigrants for their
political survival.
The rest of us have different needs. One is to ensure that the new
Europe, whether as a federation or simply a free trade area, is equipped
to cope with differences of culture and race. Bosnia is a good enough
example of the alternative for that to be obvious.
Equally clearly, however, we need to take steps to extirpate the
racism that already exists, before it grows worse. Britain already locks
up unwelcome visitors (rarely white, needless to say) in detention
centres for months at a time. Now we plan to privatise the immigration
service. None of this shows a real understanding or concern for what is
involved.
With the VE-Day anniversary just past, with memories fresh of a war to
defeat racist lunacy, a black man raised and educated in Britain is
turned away by one of our closest allies. And if they do this to
prize-winning novelists, what, do you think, do they do to the others?

IT can be a fascinating business leafing through a publisher's
catalogue. And so much quicker than reading the books.
From the list of autumn books from Mainstream, for instance, we learn
that the Duke of Windsor, Edward VIII as never was, conspired to murder
not only his brother, George VI, but also his sister-in-law, our own
dear Queen Mum.
The dastardly deed was to be done during the royal couple's state
visit to the US in 1939. According to Gwynne Thomas, author of King Pawn
or Black Knight?, a fellow conspirator of the Duke's was none other than
swashbuckling actor Errol Flynn. Flynn was present at a meeting in the
Hotel Meurice in Paris in 1937 between the Duke and leading Nazis Rudolf
Hess and Martin Bormann.
Also on the agenda at that meeting was a Nazi operation code-named
Dove which would involve an insurrection in Ireland with German backing
and assistance from Sean Russell, chief of staff of the IRA.
All this information has been dug up by Gwynne Thomas from previously
suppressed German archives. Mr Thomas should know about digging. He is a
retired civil engineer and was involved in building the M6. To see how
good is his knowledge of MI6, we must wait until October when the book
comes out.
Wanted dead
or alive
STILL on the subject of Mainstream, the publishers received a letter
from the Inland Revenue inquiring as to where they could contact one of
their authors. They would like to talk to a chap called Bud Neill about
the royalty earnings from his book of Lobey Dosser cartoon strips. The
tax people must be among the few not to know that Bud Neill has passed
away to the great artist's garret in the sky. In 1970 to be precise.
Twixt two extremes
'LABOUR leader' is one of the new entries in the Collins Concise
Dictionary which prides itself on being really up to date. It is the
mother of all reference books, they claim, market-tested for serious use
so that you won't have to surf from book to book to find politically
correct inclusive language.
The bits in italics are other new entries. But back to Mr Blair. He
can be found between blah-blah (worthless talk) and William Blake
(visionary hero).
Wishful thinking
WHEN we hear the phrase environmental art, we normally reach for our
gun. Stacks of bricks, a kitchen sink placed artistically on a pile of
salt, a pair of old boots in the corner of the gallery at the Third Eye
as was. You know the kind of thing.
There is a bit of environmental art currently in progress in the
Botanic Gardens in Glasgow. It is called the Wishing Trees.
It is the idea of Tanya Harding, a second-year student of
environmental art at Glasgow School of Art. Tanya says she is ''working
with ideas of why people visit parks and how they become an oasis of
greenery to escape from everyday city life''. So far, so very
environmental art.
What Tanya is doing is asking passers-by to write a wish, a hope, or a
dream on a strip of white cotton material and tie it to one of two
cherry trees in the park.
The result is something visually attractive, with the white material
blowing in the wind against a background of cherry blossom. Browsing
through the hundreds of wishes proves to be an experience which can be
entertaining and moving.
The message written on many of the white ribbons is of hope for peace
in the world and other right-on expressions that you would expect to
find in the West End of Glasgow.
The more mundane and personal wishes make more impact. ''I wish my dad
would stop singing in public,'' says one. Someone who is not asking for
too much in this life says: ''I hope we get the house in Yoker.''
''I hope mum and dad choose a white toilet suite,'' writes one young
lady who adds: ''PS. A man would be quite nice.''
In various childish hands can be seen requests for hamsters, gerbils,
dogs, and roller skates. Someone older requests a close personal
encounter with Pam Anderson and a large win on the National Lottery.
Good to see, by the way, that the urge to get conjugal with the Baywatch
babe came before filthy lucre in this young man's wish-list.
Football is involved of course, with not a few hopes expressed that
Celtic might win the cup final on Saturday. Someone, presumably a
Rangers fan, wishes for ''10 in a row''.
Glasgow humour is never too far away. ''I hope this tree works,'' is
one message.
Missing joker
THE Oban Times announcement of the engagement of M'Titsa Small to
M'bosa Ritchie, as reported in the Diary last week, appears to be but
the latest in a long line of unusual names which have appeared in the
columns of the august Argyllshire journal.
Others include Hugh Janus, Eva Vestoff, Ben Doon, and Phil McCavity.
But no sighting, so far, of one of the Diary's favourite hoax
correspondents -- Mr R Supward.
Little local
difficulty
THE New York Review has turned its attention to writer James Kelman,
in particular his use of demotic and downright effan bad language in the
Booker prize-winning novel How Late It Was, How Late.
The reviewer, one Denis Donoghue, states that he has no problem
understanding most of Kelman's ''local words''. Such as: ''crash (one's
turn to buy a round of drinks), skint (no money: broke), broo (the
Employment Exchange), smash (loose change), cludgie (lavatory), and tim
(Teigue, an Irishman) . . .''
But he was defeated by ''minging, scoosh, and bridie''. Mr Donoghue
also appears to be confused about the welfare payments on which Kelman's
hero survives. ''Sammy Samuels,'' he tells us, ''lives on the gyro . .
.''

IT WAS apt, perhaps, that Harold Wilson's memory should fail him
towards the end of his life.
The party for which he won an unparalleled four General Elections had
come to regard him as an embarrassment best forgotten; he seemed
content, taciturn in retirement, to oblige. There was a lot to forget.
Michael Foot once wrote of his leader: ''The cliche spread about
Wilson is that he has had an easy ride to the top, that he has dodged
the awkward tests, that he is devious and too wary. The inference. . .
is that he will continue to dodge, that he cannot be trusted.''
It had been said many times, but what makes the passage interesting is
that Foot wrote it in 1964, when Wilson was the exciting new leader of a
revitalised party, in a potboiler entitled Harold Wilson -- A Pictorial
Biography. Foot recorded those judgments, in other words, long before
the years of ''betrayal''. More interesting still, they were not views
the Bevanite supported.
On the eve of a sensational election victory, just before Labour
smashed a three-figure Tory majority, Foot could add: ''Harold Wilson's
understanding of the disease of the Labour Party has been one powerful
reason contributing towards its cure. To heal Labour's wounds, to make
his party healthily aggressive and adventurous once more -- this was his
paramount motive amid the internal party controversies.''
If the quotation sounds familiar, it is supposed to. Yesterday Tony
Blair, another youthful leader who has risen without apparent effort,
was able to praise his predecessor's ''vision'', his classlessness, and
his instinct for modernisation. On his death, Wilson begins to seem like
a patriarch.
The similarities with Blair are plain enough. Wilson also became
leader on the unexpected death of a respected predecessor with his party
emerging from years in the political wilderness. Like Blair, he pitched
his message of revival to non-socialists and socialists alike, and did
it brilliantly. He was a master of the sound-bite a decade before the
term was known.
He could damn complacency in the boardroom as easily as he could
attack ''trade-union Luddites'' and insist that inflation, above all
others, was the real threat. He was Oxbridge educated, a meritocrat, a
convert to devolution, a reformer (in principle, at least) of trade
unions. And if Mr Blair thinks the battle to rewrite Clause IV was
tough, he should think on Wilson's riposte when accused of being all
things to all men over Europe: 'I've been wading in shit for three
months to allow others to indulge their consciences'.
There is more. When the famous 1963 Commons speech on the ''white
heat'' of the scientific revolution is quoted, few remember the context.
Wilson said: ''We are redefining and we are restating our socialism in
terms of the scientific revolution . . .the Britain that is going to be
forged in the white heat of this revolution will be no place for
restrictive practices or out-dated methods on either side of industry.''
It is purest Blairism, just as the commitment to a partnership between
public and private sectors finds an echo in Labour's pledges of 1964 and
1966 to devise a national economic plan and find new ways of promoting
investment in industry. But the parallels are by no means complete, and
the party must hope, given the manner in which the Wilson years have
since been regarded, that they go no further.
In any case, Wilson began as a man of the left, something Blair has
never been.
In 1951 he and Nye Bevan quit the government and opposed the
leadership over health charges. In 1960, after the battle at the
Scarborough conference over nuclear weapons, he challenged Gaitskell for
the leadership, and in 1962 opposed George Brown for the deputy
leadership. On both occasions he knew he would lose.
Yet when he did achieve office, Wilson, who had defined Labour as a
party ''based on principles and ideals'' soon put distance between
himself and the left. In this respect Blair has the advantage, having
got his betrayals in first.
Another contrast: for Wilson expediency soon became, or appeared to
become, second nature; New Labour promises this will never happen.
Yet the real connection is that both Wilson and Blair are figures free
of political baggage.
Most obviously of all, Wilson talked, and Blair talks, of Labour as
the ''natural party of government''. What does this mean, if it ever
meant anything? Wilson suffered the humiliation of devaluation in 1967,
failed to reform the unions, was defeated by the Rhodesian crisis and
seemed, in the end, like a leader sinking in sleaze.
Yet he reformed education by ending selection, building polytechnics,
and creating universities, the Open University not least among them.
Speaking with forked tongue, he yet kept Britain out of Vietnam. He won
four General Elections despite inheriting an economic shambles and a
hostile Civil Service: no one else has managed it.
More than that, perhaps, Wilson created a society in which deference
was replaced by creativity, class-ridden torpor by optimism, a sense of
decline by youthful excitement. To an extent matched only by Churchill,
Wilson personified his era. He had its panache, its self-belief, and its
wit.
Wilson was liked. There was, in the early days at least, a glamour
about him. People of all classes believed his claim that he was a force
for change. Again, if this sounds familiar, it's supposed to. Yet Wilson
is held, by his own party not least, to have failed.
So what was ''natural'' about Labour government? Blair is not Wilson,
yet their similarities are obvious. The flair for rhetoric is the same;
the sense of crusade no different. Wilson failed because he rarely
matched words with deeds; Blair says he will never promise what he
cannot deliver. Time will tell.

ALEX Kitson, now retired and living in Edinburgh, is one of the few
remaining trade union leaders who sat in No 10 taking part in the
so-called beer and sandwiches meetings with Harold Wilson.
As a noted left-winger, Mr Kitson, who was deputy general secretary of
the Transport and General Workers' Union, and later chairman of the
Labour Party, did not always agree with Wilson politically, but he
recalled yesterday that he never lost his respect for him.
''He was a man who, in my opinion, held the Labour Party together. He
wasn't a domineering person. He would listen.
''You could go up to Downing Street and have a chat with him. You
could put your point of view and he would take it into consideration
when making his mind up,'' he said.
''Harold Wilson wasn't a guy brought up in the trade union movement,
but he always had a soft spot for the trade union movement because he
though that it had a big part to play in the country.''
The biggest fall-out between Wilson and the unions was over In Place
of Strife, the White Paper produced by Barbara Castle to curb trade
union power. It went too far for the unions, and for many Labour MPs.
Mr Kitson said: ''Barbara carried the can for it, and Harold came out
unscathed, although I'm sure Barbara was guided by him. But Harold was a
great tactician. He could smell out where the problems were, and if he
thought they were too hot, he would always get someone to deal with
them.''
Wilson also had a lot of regard for Scotland, Mr Kitson recalled. ''He
was the first guy that I can remember in the Labour Party who propagated
devolution. He didn't get much support from Willie Ross (then Scots
Secretary) or people like that.''
As for Wilson the man, Mr Kitson said: ''He was never aloof. He was
approachable. He also had a great sense of humour.''

THE shock of Harold Wilson's resignation in 1976 was followed almost
immediately by the uproar over his resignation honours. The lavender
list -- so-called because it was rumoured to have been scribbled by his
secretary on her coloured notepaper -- caused long-lasting damage to
Wilson's carefully controlled image.
Wilson was casual about honours, and distributed life peerages with
ease: according to Ben Pimlott's authoritative biography, an average of
33 a year, more than Charles II or King John.
He was acutely political in choosing those who benefited. Publication
of his final list was delayed for more than six weeks.
The list contained 42 names when it eventually appeared on May 27.
Only ten were controversial, and then only in the eyes of the left and
the media. Wilson's collection of entrepreneurs, showbiz personalities,
and wheeler-dealers were considered charter members of the ''Amalgamated
Society of Share Pushers and Company Promoters'', which, he had promised
the 1962 party conference, would have no influence on his government.
Along with his publisher, Sir George Weidenfeld, and his raincoat
maker, Sir Joseph Kagan, all 10 were made peers. James Goldsmith got a
knighthood -- not a peerage as widely predicted. Impresarios Lew Grade
and Bernard Delfont were also knighted.
Wilson was immediately accused of converting to capitalism, of looking
to his own financial future.
Joe Haines, his press secretary, had opposed some of the names and let
it be known the list had been drafted by Wilson's secretary Marcia
Williams -- Lady Falkender -- on lavender notepaper. She retaliated by
accusing her attackers of anti-semitism.

MALCOLM RIFKIND is not only deriding the Irish Free State's Army,
Navy, and Air Force but also the possible Scottish free state's forces.
Many of us would assume that since, from its inception, no foreign
country had shown aggression to the Irish, their forces were adequate
for its protection.
After Mr Rifkind's speech to the Scottish Tories I was left with the
impression that the Irish Navy consisted of about six rowing boats. This
does not seem to have been judged inadequate by the many pensioners who
have left the UK to settle in Ireland and enjoy the benefits which this
''poor little defenceless nation'' can provide for its senior citizens.
They apparently enjoy the free travel provided, free TV licence,
better law and order, etc.
Trident may be a most impressive weapon but it does not protect
pensioners from hypothermia. The money spent on it could provide for
many more jobs than the Faslane base. It is not as if we are involved
with the manufacture since these jobs are in America.

WE were among the fortunate allocated tickets for Scottish Opera's
Soundbites performance. In an unpretentious location -- the Shed -- with
performers in casual clothes, the magic was in the music and in the
voices.
It has really whetted our appetites for more. I wish to thank The
Herald for advising us of the opportunity to apply for tickets and
experience a most memorable evening.

WHAT an extraordinary reaction to Closer Than Ever at the Cottier
Theatre (May 16).
In a collection of choice songs, witty and tender, superbly sung and
played in an immaculate production by Floyd Kennedy, I could have though
there was something to appeal to everyone, regardless of age or class or
nationality, provided, of course, they had some glimmering of what
musical theatre is all about.

JOHN FRANCE recollects correctly (May 22). There is a ''certain
vantage point in central Scotland'' from which it is possible to see the
firths of both Forth and Clyde. It is, however, a little higher than the
Slamannan plateau.
I celebrated VE Day in the most appropriate way this year. I had a
beautiful walk, in fine weather, in the Kilsyth Hills, a half-hour's
drive from home.
From the top of Meikle Bin, easily reached from the Crow Road between
Lennoxtown and Fintry, I could see the whole of central Scotland from
North Berwick Law to Ailsa Craig. I highly recommend it.
I had the added bonus of a glimpse of black grouse in the coniferous
plantation on the col between Lecket Hill and Meikle Bin. What a
wonderful privilege it is to live in Glasgow!

RECENTLY, with 20 others from the west of Scotland, mostly
schoolteachers, I was a guest of Arrow Educational Tours of Belfast for
a weekend visit to Northern Ireland -- my first visit since the shooting
stopped.
The last visit included stepping over soldiers lying at street corners
with guns at the ready; avoiding heavily armed, flak-jacketed policemen,
and marvelling at the resilience of people who could carry on something
like an everyday life in such circumstances and still be so cheerful.
Now you can smell the hope and taste the relief so wonderfully evident
in the welcome received and the hospitality given.
I consider myself to be fairly well-travelled in Western Europe and
North America but nowhere have I ever been so well received and treated.
Aside from the beautiful and interesting countryside, we were given
tours of the city of Belfast -- warts and all -- the Lagan Lough and its
new weir, then the piece de resistance, the City Hall. (As a lover of
history and an admirer of baroque and classical architecure I could
cheerfully have spent the entire weekend in this building.)
One other very important sign of hope is that the streets and
car-parks of Belfast are busy with cars from the Republic of Ireland.
This is very recent and much remarked upon by the locals.
I shall certainly revisit Northern Ireland, for a longer stay,
sometime soon.
Finally, I wonder how many know that Belfast, like Pisa, has a leaning
tower.
Want to know more? Go, and have a ball, while you find out.

BILL MILLER, MEP, in his letter shows the rhetoric which has become
commonplace in New Labour (May 15). He will of course remember that on
Thursday, June 9, last year, the only Euro-seat in the UK which Labour
lost was the North-east of Scotland to the SNP which took the seat with
a 30,000 majority.
He may not like to admit it publicly but he will also remember that
the SNP's Winnie Ewing, MEP, fought hard to achieve Objective One status
for the Highlands and Islands, something which I as a constituent can
say has benefited the area greatly.
Mr Miller goes on to stress that the electorate should vote for the
Labour Party because of its size in the European Parliament. I will not
suggest he remembers what Lord Cooper, Scotland's Lord Justice-General,
said in a speech in 1949 so, for his and your readers' benefit, here is
an extract: ''The spirit of age has manifested itself in one of those
recurrent crazes . . . for the absorption of smaller units into even
larger amalgamations as if a special virtue resided in mere size.''
Scotland can never expect to have a large presence in the European
Parliament; however, Labour's plans for representation in the toothless
Committee of the Regions will not benefit Scotland at all. As an
independent nation, Scotland would be represented at the highest levels
-- the Commission, the European Council, and the Council of Ministers.
Neither Scotland's nor the SNP's lack of power within the European
Union is due to the small number of MEPs but is rather a result of the
constitutional position which the Tories and the Labour Party both wish
to continue.

I FIND it incredible that a church -- the Church of Scotland -- which
is losing members and influence tackles its problems by proposing
legislation which will allow it to close more churches, even ones which
are self-supporting but not always able to pay their full tax for the
wider work of the Church.
The tax in the main is to support laudable aims which I support, even
although how the final amount is worked out is an official secret.
Paul's way of tackling problems in the Church was by exhortation and
encouragement; the Church of Scotland way would seem to be by threats.
At a time when Christians more than ever should be witnessing the Good
News to a society becoming more secular by the minute, the Church of
Scotland is proposing to cut back the funding to the Board of
Communication which will make savings on publicity, audio-visual, and
publishing.
If we are in trouble due to lack of members and lack of funding, it
must surely point to a spiritual crisis in Scotland and in these
circumstances one of the last things to be done is to curtail
communication.
The trend in the Church of Scotland appears to be towards taking any
control that it has away from the parish church and even from the
presbytery and the General Assembly and concentrating it in the
committees of presbytery and assembly, to my mind not the best way to
encourage participation.

I HAVE read the article by Jennifer Cunningham on the recycling
policies in this country (May 19).
I have just returned from Connecticut, USA, where recycling of all
materials is very important to the residents. Everything is collected,
cartons, tins, paper bags, newspapers, etc.
The large stores have machines for cans, bottles and plastic bottles
from which you receive five cents for each container returned.
This might reduce the amount of cans, etc, such as are to be found
littering our countryside, as well as contributing to the re-use of
valuable materials.

ALEXANDER McKENZIE'S article on Initial Teacher Education (May 23)
indicates that a number of countries are moving towards a two-year
programme of secondary teacher training following the completion of an
appropriate initial degree.
There can be little doubt in anyone's mind that a two-year programme
consisting of a balance between school placements and in-faculty
academic programmes would be more beneficial than the current one-year
postgraduate model.
It is also interesting to note that the best-trained teachers appear
to come from those countries with longer training programmes.
We would prefer a two-year training programme which would allow
student teachers to develop their professional expertise and skills
based on in-depth faculty programmes and school experience placements
supported professionally by both faculty tutors and by experienced staff
in schools.
We would also like to have the opportunity to visit students more than
20 times as indicated in the German model.
However, financial constraints imposed upon us by our funding body
mean that in 1993-4 the average number of tutor visits to each student
was 8.1 and in 1994-5 an average of 6.4 visits applied.
The introduction of the new Scottish Office Education Department
mentoring scheme will mean that the in-faculty teaching and the tutor
visits to students in schools will have to be further reduced because of
the reduced funding available to institutions, even although the time
spent on school experience placements will be increased for students.
The clear implication is that some countries appear to be placing an
emphasis on the quality and depth of training rather than a superficial
increase in on-the-job training and back this emphasis with an
appropriate level of resources.

I FIND myself in agreement with Chief Constable Leslie Sharp when he
expresses concern about the drift towards unaccountable private policing
-- and state-supported vigilantes (May 16).
Indeed, that he should mention the M77 is highly significant. All
those who witnessed Wimpey's chain-saw swoop on Corkerhill in order to
cut down the woodland trees must have had little doubt about what
private force money can buy.
Indeed I suggested to the Strathclyde police officers and inspectors
on duty at the barricades that the low-paid casual security guards
employed by Wimpey might well be shadowing their jobs.

use of this system in an effort to overcome the pollution.
A firm in York, which made rolling-stock for use on our railway system
is about to shut down with the loss of jobs. Could this firm not be

I WAS pleased to see W Kelsey's letter on the imminent withdrawal of
the Glasgow-Plymouth sleeper (May 20).
I have found this service invaluable when taking my small children to
Dorset and it has always been my experience that the train is
well-patronised.
I have written to Brian Mawhinney drawing these points to his
attention; maybe it is significant that he has not seen fit to reply.
As with the Fort William sleeper, I suspect that the marginal costs of
running the train are slight and that the real problem is the
indiscriminately insensitive allocation of track costs in the run-up to
privatisation.

THE headlines are gone, the story is rapidly becoming a vague memory
in the public mind, the gruesome horror of what was divulged in court is
becoming mitigated with the passing of the days, but for the village of
West Kilbride the memory lingers and the anger is not diffused. Anger,
righteous honourable anger, that one of the young people of the
community should have died in such a savage way and loved ones should
have been so cruelly tortured by learning about the means of her death
while it emerges that the murderer and the penal system were both guilty
of the atrocity.
Edward Mullen, who recently served a prison term for violent sex
offences, has been sentenced to life with a recommendation that he serve
15 years for Yvette Wilson's death -- but who will really bear the
responsibility for the crime? Who within the penal system will be held
answerable for its shortcomings? The truth is that no-one will. Yet the
people of the village community hold that system equally guilty for this
outrageous evil.
In general a murder is a nine-day wonder to be held in focus for as
long as the news media run the story, but when a village community is
touched by it, when the loved ones of the victim are known to the
majority of its people, and when the murderer chose to make his home
within it after serving a prison sentence for violent sexual offences,
the impact of such a horror is not so easily set aside. The wider issues
surrounding this case may not get more mileage in news columns but the
alert must be sounded far beyond West Kilbride to draw attention to the
errors of others that contributed, directly or indirectly, to the murder
of Yvette Wilson.
Why was Edward Mullen not assessed, counselled, and treated while he
was in prison for the previous offences he committed? The authorities
knew he was a severe danger to women yet he merely ''did his time'' and
was released into the community. It is alleged that the offender
reported to the prison staff that he had unusual impulses towards women,
but they maintain that they have no record of such reports. Surely it is
crass to argue this point when in truth such a man ought automatically
to have been given some assessment on entry to prison and appropriate
treatment administered while he was inside.
In a severely edited broadcast on BBC television's evening news
programme I was heard to say that I had some sympathy for Edward Mullen
because he was a victim of the penal system. I said more, and I say more
still, because this case highlights how many people are such victims.
There are loved ones of the murdered girl who want to know why this man
was released into the community without receiving some investigation and
treatment for his self-confessed problems; they are victims. There is a
village, one of whose young people will not step brightly on to its
station platform again, which feels that it has been made a victim.
There is Yvette, unable now to speak for herself, who is the victim
above all victims in this issue.
Don't let me hear again what I have heard recently, namely, ''It
happens all over the country Mr Mitchell, you may raise as much flak as
you like but in the end nothing will be done.''
Why will nothing be done? Will the prison authorities not respond to
this opportunity to tell us why Mr Mullen received no specialist
treatment while under custodial care? Will the political masters not
tell us why there seems to be no will to understand criminal motivation
before putting a person back on the streets? Is there really a belief
that evil acts are dealt with my removing the perpetrator's liberty for
a set time?
Surely in parallel with the serving of a prison sentence should go the
effort to deal with the causes that led the guilty party to court. West
Kilbride's problem cannot be resolved, but perhaps if we impress upon
those who supervise the imprisonment of sex offenders that they have a
stewardship responsibility on behalf of the rest of society to address
the criminals' problems and attempt to deal with them then others will
not suffer as one of our villagers did.
Somehow I sense a rising tide of cynicism from those who have to
administer custodial supervision. I fear there will be ''tut-tuts'' from
certain quarters. ''He doesn't know the system,'' they will say. ''There
is always someone in the community trying to make a cause celebre out of
their little moment of suffering. Don't they know it's going on all over
the country at some time or another.''
So much more's the shame! And who is going to step out of the closet
of professional protective convenience and say that the public are being
cheated? Or will the next case emerge with similar repetitiveness?
Lawyers will offer mitigating circumstances, judges will issue severe
comments about criminal behaviour before passing sentence, and the
prisoner will be led to the prison cell where he will do time and that
is about all. He is certainly unlikely to have serious consideration
given to the motivation behind his actions.
It is surely to be expected that rehabilitation is a signally
important concept at work within the penal system. But when ''released
from prison'' is synonymous with ''rehabilitated into the community''
something has gone far wrong. For the greater good of all in society the
death of Yvette Wilson in West Kilbride must not pass without something
being done so that people with known and admitted violent sexual
problems receive treatment while serving sentence, and are not released
into the community without professional judgment being passed on their
suitability to do so. Who is going to do it?

'Wilson, who liked to be photographed with his pipe and a pint, had
taken to large brandies and cigars, particularly when he was preparing
for the twice-weekly ordeal of Prime Minister's questions.
I HEARD it first as a tip from, of all places, the Stock Exchange. It
was just after noon on March 16, 1976. Stockbrokers rumours are
notoriously unreliable. But this one was spot on. Harold Wilson had just
told his Cabinet that was resigning.
He was only 60 and at the height of his powers as the longest serving
Labour Prime Minister, having won four General Elections. He had
achieved his aim of establishing Labour as ''the natural party of
government''. He had dominated political life for a decade.
Westminster was stunned. Why had he done it? Was he ill? Was it his
paranoia about the secret service attempting to smear him? Was there a
sex scandal? Or had a dodgy financial friend involved him in something
nefarious?
His Deputy Leader Ted Short was in tears as he delivered a Cabinet
tribute to the man who had been at No 10 for eight years. Chancellor Roy
Jenkins and Home Secretary Jim Callaghan (who did not believe him) had
been in on the secret, as had the Queen who had been told (according to
Wilson) as she was doing some washing up with his wife Mary in a chalet
on the Balmoral estate. On December 8 he confirmed that he would resign
in March.
One person who had not been told was his Defence Secretary Denis
Healey who was as shocked as anybody. A few days previously he had been
particularly rude to the Labour left wing in a rowdy scene in the
Commons Chamber. This did not help his chances in the election for
Wilson's successor, won by Callaghan.
Wilson had been convinced that there were security plots against him
for some time and had complained about this to colleagues. There had
been a series of burglaries at the homes of his staff.
Spycatcher Peter Wright gave some credence to this in his notorious
book. He alleged that there had been some sort of plot by MI5 to bring
down the Labour Government. Wilson was also convinced that Boss, the
South African secret service, not only smeared the Liberal leader Jeremy
Thorpe, but was out to do the same to him.
Five weeks after he resigned, he summoned two journalists to his home
in Lord North Street to tell them of an MI5 plot against him. ''There
followed an extraordinary explosion of delusion, suspicion and
occasional black humour which revealed -- if nothing else -- the extent
of the psychological strains Wilson had suffered in office,'' wrote his
biographer, Professor Ben Pimlott.
Wilson had had a particularly exhausting time at the top. It was a
miracle that he was able to keep his government and his party intact.
Sterling crises and the inheritance of 13 Tory ''wasted'' years had
forced him to renege on election pledges. Night after night in the
Commons he survived on votes of one or two.
Wilson, who liked to be photographed with his pipe and a pint, had
taken to large brandies and cigars, particularly when he was preparing
for the twice-weekly ordeal of Prime Minister's questions. I recall him
once at the Despatch Box distinctly squiffy -- not by any means the
first Prime Minister to be so.
He was becoming profoundly weary.
Lady Castle recalls going to see him when he was in ''chucking it all
in'' mood. Lord Jenkins, on radio yesterday, spoke of the possibility
that Wilson had intimations of a failing of his remarkable gifts,
particularly his renowned memory.
Lord Jenkins said in his tribute: ''If so it was a noble exercise in
self-discipline. Years later, and after a cancer operation, I recall the
sadness of him having to ask Mary at a Soviet Embassy reception to
remind him of the year (1974) when he had two General Elections.''
It is possible that way back in 1975/76 he felt this coming on. But
for years after his resignation his mind was still sharp and his
speeches articulate, so failing faculties seem unlikely to be the cause.
It is more likely that Mary, who hated the political life, was anxious
to get him out for some rest for both of them.
Biographer Philip Ziegler wrote that by 1975 Wilson had lost his
delight in intrigue and that he had told Barbara Castle that he was
getting stomach pains from stress, that he was sleeping badly, and that
after particularly painful confrontations he would be physically sick.
''The work was starting to get on top of him. It was not the sudden
crises -- those he tolerated even relished -- it was the ceaseless grind
of routine matters the pressure of working at a desk where every buck
was bound eventually to stop.''
There was also the stress of his ''kitchen Cabinet'' in which his
political secretary Marcia Williams was getting on everyone's nerves.
Mary was said to want him to retire, while Marcia (now Lady Williams)
was tugging him the other way.
Professor Pimlott's conclusions are now widely shared. ''The
conspiracy theories that have been designed to solve what some have seen
as the riddle of Wilson's early retirement do not add up. The
straightforward explanation for his departure, that he left because he
had lost the desire to carry on requires no amplification.''
Cabinet colleague Peter Shore states that he had decided a year
beforehand that he would go when he reached his 60th birthday.
Perhaps his former press secretary Joe Haines, who had locked the date
of the resignation away in his safe at No 10 months before in order to
demonstrate that it had all been planned, has got it absolutely right.
One of the reasons for stepping down he suggests is ''he wanted people
to ask why he went rather than why he stayed''.

HAROLD WILSON was Labour Prime Minister between 1964-70 and again
after 1974 until 1976 when he unexpectedly retired to be succeeded by
James, now Lord, Callaghan. He was an unusually kind man of conspicuous
intelligence. His university career had been oustanding; it seemed that
he would continue as an academic economist, but a spell of work under
Sir William Beveridge, the Liberal architect of much of the post-war
welfare state, brought him early to the interface of academic and
political life. Instead of Academe, he choose politics, and he was
returned as MP for Ormskirk in the Labour landslide of 1945.
It may seem strange that the taint of failure lingers over Wilson, in
spite of his subsequent meteoric rise and an electoral record which has
not been surpassed. Yet perhaps his four General Election victories
themselves advertise in a symbolic way the ambiguity of his success, for
those of 1966 and October 1974 were really confirmations of previous
narrow and unsustainable leads over the Tories months previously.
Indeed, in the first contest of 1974 Wilson's tiny lead in seats
concealed a deficit in popular votes. His vote-getting powers were
remarkable none the less. The election success of 1964 was fully
justified by his conduct as leader of the Opposition in the years
following Hugh Gaitskell's death in 1963. The performance was as
brilliant as the wit which often inspired it. He enthused his party and
captivated much of the country. Some evidence suggests that he might not
have won in 1964 had Harold Macmillan not panicked over his own health
and delivered the Tory leadership to Lord Home. Even so, the latter lost
by the narrowest of margins in spite of Wilson's brilliant way with
words and identification of the Tories' long run in office from 1951 as
''13 wasted years''. In office, his grip was less assured. Internal
divisions in the Labour Party made its management almost impossible. The
divisions went back to 1947, when Attlee had begun to lose his control
of the left as his administration was forced to adopt what seemed like
right-wing policies (in response to the Korean War, for example). Wilson
himself had contributed to Attlee's difficulties, and sent quite the
wrong signal to the party's left, when he resigned from the Cabinet with
Nye Bevan (and John Freeman) over prescription charges. He was not
left-wing either emotionally or intellectually, though he was greatly
taken by Bevan and probably saw his political future with him. Wilson's
cool, rational, and analytical mind almost inevitably opposed him to
Bevan's main rival, Hugh Gaitskell, then Chancellor, who, while
intellectually gifted himself, was anything but cool, being passionate
about his beliefs to the point of intemperance. Wilson's rivalry with
Gaitskell seemed to confirm his left-wing disposition, a position made
more prominent when Bevan died unexpectedly, leaving him the main
spokesman of Labour radicalism.
That confusion was to lead the Labour left to accuse Wilson of
betrayal; but the right of the party did not trust him either, after
Gaitskell's own unexpected death in 1963 produced Wilson's succession as
leader. The right held Wilson's cleverness against him, finding in his
ability to rationalise almost any outcome an insubstantial quality, a
lack of principle even. Wilson had seemed to oppose Gaitskell on both
domestic and foreign, particularly nuclear, policy. The Gaitskellites
had no choice but to accept him after 1963, but their respect for him
was always qualified. Much of Wilson's energy in office therefore had to
be devoted to reconciling these two groups. He never managed it for
long.
He did identify many of the difficulties which needed to be tackled
for Britain to realise its fullest potential; and he did try to address
them. He sought to relax the role of the Treasury in confining economic
expansion by establishing a new Department of Economic Affairs, giving
it a dynamic head in George Brown. It failed, and the massive enforced
devaluation of 1967 did great damage to the country's economic base. He
would have been better advised to have devalued in 1964 when it would
have been far less costly and could have been blamed on the out-going
Tories. Even his capacity for the telling phrase deserted him in 1967
and his insistence, in a television broadcast, that ''the pound in your
pocket has not been devalued'' was to haunt him.
If it seems hard to grasp that a trained economist with such a fine
mind could have failed so comprehensively in his own field, it should be
added that the forces arrayed against him were very powerful. As he
quickly realised, they included organised labour, in whose bowels, as
one trade unionist put it, the Labour Party had been conceived. Long
before Mrs Thatcher, Wilson tried to reform the unions. His chosen
instrument was the brave and determined Barbara Castle whose White Paper
In Place of Strife anticipated the Thatcher reforms, but in milder
fashion. Wilson failed to support her when the TUC and James Callaghan
mounted their successful opposition. He was not a tough enough Prime
Minister: Callaghan, who succeeded him, proved to have a surer touch.
His repeated attempts to accommodate the demands of the Rhodesian
leader, Ian Smith, seemed to display one of Wilson's worst features, his
willingness to give way. It could be read, just as plausibly, as a sign
of strength: he was mentally agile, imaginative, and flexible. These
qualities were displayed when he engineered the referendum on Europe in
1975 as a mechanism to settle a vital question but avoid an open split
in the Labour Party which was then as divided on that matter as the
Tories are today.
Harold Wilson had a capacity for radiating calm authority. His
Yorkshire accent, re-cultivated after it was in danger of losing out to
Oxford, lent him a classless appeal. He owed everything to merit, though
his attempt to claim a barefoot childhood was a barefaced lie which did
him a little damage. He had a romantic element in his make-up (which may
explain his dalliance with the left) but he may have suffered from an
inability to make political friends. His stewardship of the Labour Party
may not have been its happiest time, but his three successors showed
none of his electoral success -- and none of his luck.
He must be judged as, above all, a consummate political tactician. He
was never an ideologue, and that is probably to his credit. There is a
lasting, and distinguished, legacy: the Open University, and many other
new universities, such as Stirling, are a major part of that legacy. A
vaguer, but none the less very real, achievement was the way in which he
guided Britain, in the space of a mere decade, from being an aspiring
imperial power (''with a place at the top table'' in Douglas-Home's
rather ridiculous phrase) to its modern role as a middle-ranking power.
This was a painful process; it could have been much more painful, and
much more protracted, had it not been for Wilson's couthy pragmatism.
Finally, as his official biographer Philip Ziegler noted, ''he strove to
render less the sum of human wretchedness''. He may have been devious
and opportunistic, but he was at heart a good man.

Wilson was rarely touched by failure David Butler Fellow of Nuffield
College, Oxford, and Britain's leading electoral historian, looks at his
record
HAROLD WILSON'S father, when he came to party conferences in the
1960s, loved to prove that he could recall every constituency result
from the Liberal triumph of 1906. Harold inherited his father's
formidable memory -- and his love of demonstrating it. He had cause to
be pleased with his psephological recollections.
He never had the trauma of losing a constituency contest. But,
although he ended his 31 years in Parliament with massive majorities
(based on the bleak new estates of Kirby near Liverpool) he had known
what it was to fight a marginal seat.
He got into the Commons for Ormskirk in 1945 largely because the
anti-Labour vote was split by the remarkable Stephen King-Hall, and in
1950 and 1951 he only scraped in for the new seat of Huyton by 1000 or
so majorities -- a far cry from the 21,000 lead he was achieving by
1970.
Within the Labour Party, in the national executive elections he
triumphed regularly from 1951 to 1962, often heading the poll. He was
rebuffed by the Parliamentary party when he challenged Hugh Gaitskell in
1960, and he was beaten by 166 to 80.
But when Gaitskell died George Brown and Jim Callaghan split the right
wing vote on the first ballot; and by the time of the second ballot the
ebullient Brown had offended enough Labour MPs for the subtler Wilson to
win, by 144-103.
As a national party leader he could boast of winning four General
Elections out of five. His 1964 success was by the disappointing margin
of five seats -- and he might well have lost if Kruschev had fallen 24
hours earlier.
But he steered that shaky majority into a 100-seat triumph 18 months
later in March 1966. In 1970, he seemed to be heading for another
victory until a blip in the balance of payments figures (aided perhaps
by England's defeat by West Germany in the World Cup Finals in Mexico)
induced a last-minute swing against Labour.
But if the defeat in June 1970 was unexpected, so was the victory in
February 1974 when Wilson doggedly defused Ted Heath's ''Who governs?''
appeal over the miners' strike. Labour actually got 1% fewer votes than
the Conservatives, but four more seats -- and in seven months Wilson,
with the skills shown ten years earlier, parlayed his minority
Government into a majority one (albeit with a lead of only three seats
which soon dissolved).
To win, or to come a very close second, in five successive elections
was an achievement unmatched since Gladstone and Salisbury in the
previous century.
Harold Wilson has other claims to a place in history. Under his
premiership, the voting age was reduced to 18, party labels appeared on
the ballot paper -- and, alas, the close of voting was extended from 9pm
to 10pm!
Under him too, the electoral see-saw reached new heights. In March 28,
1968, his Government lost three by-elections in a single day, and Dudley
registered a record 22% swing from Labour to Conservative.
While Harold Wilson was at No 10 the nationalists made their inroads
into the Westminster world. Gwynfor Evans became Plaid Cymru's first MP
in a 1966 by-election.
A year later, Winnie Ewing won Hamilton for the SNP. Following Margo
MacDonald's 1973 triumph in Govan, there came the 1974 breakthrough when
the SNP won, first, seven and then, in the second election of that year,
11 seats -- warning Labour that its ousting of the Conservatives from a
major position in Scotland was not going to guarantee them a monopoly of
power.
Wilson's characteristic response to the Hamilton by-election of 1967
had been to set up the Crowther, later the Kilbrandon, Commission but he
was to learn that such a device was insufficient to cope with the
genuine electoral tide in Scotland.
Yet, all in all, the psephological memory left by Harold Wilson was
more of success than failure. Few Labour leaders could say that.

The jury is still ruminating on the British entries at the Cannes Film
Festival, but at least they didn't walk out, reports William Russell
It is something of a tradition that film ministers come down here,
utter platitudes and lose the job
THE British came, were seen, but whether they have conquered the
oldest and most distinguished of film festivals nobody will know until
the prizes are announced on Sunday. The Cannes jury is notoriously
unpredictable, but this year they will be perverse in the extreme if
some, at least, of the British made films do not feature in their list.
The hot favourite so far is Ken Loach's Spanish Civil War drama, Land
and Freedom. It is about a young Liverpool communist, played by Ian
Hart, who joins the International Brigade and falls in love. It was
rapturously received by a notoriously difficult audience at its press
screening. When they don't like a film here they walk out. Everybody
stayed.
Christopher Hampton's film about the Bloomsbury set, Carrington, which
stars Emma Thompson as the painter who loved Lytton Strachey, a
confirmed bachelor, and had a platonic marriage with him for 15 years,
as well as many affairs on the side, was much admired.
Thompson is good as Dora Carrington, a woman who discovered sex late
in life and then had lots of it; but the film is stolen by Jonathan
Pryce as Strachey. He is certainly a contender for the best actor prize.
But it has not all been bouquets for Britain. The first film to get
booed was Neon Bible, directed by Terence Davies, which stars Gina
Rowlands as a down-on-her-luck singer who goes to live with her sister
in Georgia. It is set in the 1940s and focuses on a small boy growing up
surrounded by women -- Rowlands plays his aunt -- and abusive older men.
In other words, it is a typical Davies film with all the faults of his
previous work and showing no signs of advancement.
John Boorman also came up with a powerful picture. Beyond Rangoon was
liked by some of the critics and hated by others. It is set in Burma
during the unrest of 1988, which was so cruelly suppressed by the
military junta. An American widow, Patricia Arquette, travelling in the
East to forget a family tragedy, loses her passport and is left behind
by her tour group while it is replaced.
She sees Aung San Sun Kyi, who won the Nobel Peace Prize three years
later, defying the military, and is inspired by what she sees. Then she
goes on a trip up country with an old professor who is forced to work as
a guide, Aung Ko, and becomes involved in the rebellion.
The two have to flee to the Thai border to safety. Boorman handles the
adventure story with great skill, and the Malaysian locations stand in
spectacularly for Burma. The trouble is, Arquette is not a sufficiently
high-powered actress to hold the centre of the film and her character
is, to put it mildly, very confused.
Chris Newby, who made Anchoress, a drama set in the Middle Ages, has
come up this time with an odd but much admired little film, Madagascar
Skin. It stars the Scots actor John Hannah as a disturbed young
homosexual with a huge purple blemish on his face -- hence the title,
since it looks like the island -- who runs away to Wales and meets a
mysterious thug played by Bernard Hill.
The two men become friends, and then very good friends. Filmed in
colour, it has been ravishingly photographed and is very well acted,
although it is hard to see just what audience it is aimed at. It is
certainly not your run-of-the-mill gay movie.
The other big British film here is The Madness of King George. Cannes
may well adore it and give Nigel Hawthorne the big acting prize he so
richly deserves, but Nicholas Hytner's film was an Oscar contender, and
that could work against it when the jury comes to weigh up the pros and
cons.
The British Film Institute's Three Steps to Heaven has divided opinion
dramatically. Some people think it brilliant; others, including me,
think it a poorly made load of cobblers. Katrin Cartlidge plays a young
woman trying to discover how her lover died after he is taken away from
a nightclub by three strangers -- an East End wide boy, a promiscuous
gay Labour MP and an over-the-hill TV game show hostess.
She eventually finds out, but it really is a journey not worth taking
and one does wonder why the BFI puts its money into films like this.
The other British films on show both star Hugh Grant, who seems to be
obligatory these days. They are An Awfully Big Adventure, based on Beryl
Bainbridge's story about her life in a Rep just after the war, which has
already been released in Britain, and The Man Who Went Up a Hill And
Came Down a Mountain.
Tim Burton's Ed Wood, which opens tomorrow in Scotland, would have
been a potential winner if it, too, like The Madness of King George, had
not also been an Oscar contender. But it remains a marvellous movie and
the jury may well fall for it.
There have been some rather spectacular parties, the sun has managed
to shine nearly every day, and Emma Thompson managed to disclose that
she first had sex at the age of 15, which sent Britain's tabloid press
into a tizzy.
Polygram, the production company, got terribly uptight about the fact
that Michael Grade of Channel 4 has taken much of the credit for Four
Weddings and a Funeral, and thus saving the British film industry. The
message from Polygram's boss, Michael Kuhn, to the other Michael was:
''Screw you.''
The BBC, which has five films either in competition or in the
marketplace, did not think much of Polygram's boasting. It is planning
to make more films for release in the cinema, and held its first ever
press lunch here. It was a howling success and the chances are Cannes
has a new fixture in its social diary.
Not everyone is here to promote films that are in competition. Peter
Fonda, who will for ever be known, turned up to help sell Nadja, a
low-budget vampire film set in New York, which is very stylish and
funny. Fonda was last here in 1969 for Easy Rider.
Reflecting on his experience he said it was tough being a cinema icon.
''I thought it an honour to be invited in 1969, and then when I got here
I discovered I was just a piece of meat shuffled from one interview to
another,'' he said. ''Moo. Cannes is a meat market. Moo. It was only
when I got into the lobby of my hotel I realised I was just a piece of
meat. Moo.'' Fonda certainly has style.
The same could not be said of the Heritage Minister, Stephen Dorrell,
who is also the umpteenth minister for the film industry and a candidate
for a new job in the next reshuffle. It is something of a tradition that
film ministers come to Cannes, utter platitudes, and lose the job.
Dorrell lived up to a long, ignoble tradition, and said that in the
nine months he had held the post his views about the potential of the
British film industry had changed. Nobody was encouraged and nobody
believed that the White Paper promised for next month will provide any
of the answers.
Cannes has still got three days to go. And just in case you think it
has all been champagne, bare-breasted starlets, parties and sunbathing
on the beach, in the past seven days I have seen 32 films and I reckon
there are another 10 to go. You don't get a suntan inside a cinema.

THE Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic, said today that his forces
would treat UN peacekeepers as hostile if the organiation called in Nato
air strikes after the expiry of an ultimatum to stop the shelling of
Sarajevo.
Earlier the UN commander in Bosnia, Lieutenant-General Rupert Smith,
threatened both the Bosnian government and separatist Serbs with NATO
air strikes.
His ultimatum followed a day of heavy fighting which left at least six
people dead and 31, including two French peacekeepers, wounded.

IN death, Ed Wood has secured the celebrity that eluded him in life.
Tim Burton's enchanting film, Ed Wood, has not been a huge hit in
America, but it is hardly surprising, being a labour of love, not a
would-be blockbuster. Johnny Depp plays Ed, maker of a string of
low-budget films in the 1950s, who ended up, his career having vanished,
an alcoholic earning a living writing pornographic novels.
The film, however, does not take us to Ed's lower depths. Rather it is
about his boundless optimism. Ed wanted nothing more out of life than to
make movies, and that he was a really rotten director is neither here
nor there.
Burton focuses on his friendship with the great horror film star, Bela
Lugosi, who starred in some of Ed's films. Lugosi, when Ed met him, was
down on his luck -- a sick old man. Ed took him under his wing, partly
because he was genuinely kindly, partly because in Bela he had a real,
if faded, star for his films.
Martin Landau won an Oscar for his performance as Lugosi, and a tour
de force it is. But there is another to marvel at. In a bar Ed meets
Orson Welles (Vincent d'Onfrio in an uncanny impersonation) and the
encounter, Ed starry-eyed at meeting his hero, the great man confessing
it can be tough for geniuses too, is a delight.
Wood, a complex man, who liked nothing better than to don a lady's
angora sweater when depressed, had been a Second World War hero who went
into battle in the kind of underwear which compelled him to survive.
As for his films -- they included Glen and Glenda, about transvestism,
in which he starred, Night of the Ghouls, and Plan 9 From Outer Space,
his master-disaster -- they were ghastly, and his status as Hollywood's
worst ever director is deserved. Burton has rescued him from obscurity
in this funny, endearing film which is about hope, dreams and, above
all, about love. Ed loved movies.
In Le Colonel Chabert, directed by Yves Angelo, Gerard Depardieu is
the down and out claiming to be the Colonel returned from the dead to
claim his rights. In 1817, 10 years after the battle of Elau, in which
he was thought to have been killed, Chabert returns to Paris. He enlists
the help of a lawyer, Fabrice Luchini, to help get his wife, Fanny
Ardent, now remarried to a social climbing count, Andre Dusollier, to
admit to his identity.
Ardent, a scheming and acute businesswoman, who has vastly increased
her first husband's fortune, will have none of him. But she is also
aware her present husband, who wants to become a peer, would happily
divorce her if he could marry a wife to ensure his elevation. The film,
based on a novel by Honore de Balzac, should be a rich stew, but Angelo,
a cameraman making his debut as director, proves thoroughly pedestrian.
The film's best moments are its recreation of Eylau. A piano plays a
limpid, sad melody -- the slow movement from Schubert's Piano Sonata in
A, if I have read the production notes correctly -- as the camera scans
slowly over the dead, men and animals, the looters, the fugitives, the
last random cavalry charges, and unsparingly shows the horrors of war.
Luchini, who represents both Chabert and Ardent, is very good, and
Ardent comes across strongly as the steel magnolia wife, but Depardieu
seems to be coasting in a worthy, but deeply uninspired film.
Macaulay Culkin stars in Richie Rich as Richie, heir to $70 billion,
who has to fight for his inheritance when a wicked executive at the
family firm, Lawrence Van Dough (John Laroquette) sets out to get rid of
his parents who are duly lost at sea.
Richie, with the help of his imperturbable valet, Cadbury (Jonathan
Hyde) fights back and discovers that money cannot buy you everything.
True friendship is beyond price. Hey ho.

Paris, Wednesday
LESS than a week after his appointment as Prime Minister to President
Jacques Chirac, Mr Alain Juppe has outlined his Government's plans to
fight unemployment and poverty in the general policy speech to the
National Assembly.
Mr Chirac's election on May 7 was largely the result of ambitious
promises to solve unemployment, officially standing at 3.3 million in
France, and combat homelessness.
Mr Juppe's faithful transcription of those promises was greeted
enthusiastically by the large right-wing majority in the National
Assembly on Tuesday evening. But the Prime Minister got a lukewarm
reception from the socialist and communist opposition and trade unions,
who found his measures insufficient, uncosted, and in many cases
unoriginal. Conservative critics question how the Government's plans are
compatible with Mr Juppe's declared intention of adopting the single
European currency by January 1, 1999.
''Several million French people are cut off from the rest of society.
Their exclusion endangers the equilibrium of our society . . . the
entire work programme which I am presenting can be resumed in a single
word -- unemployment,'' Mr Juppe told French MPs.
The Prime Minister's first measure, to be introduced in the coming
weeks, consists of an ''initiative employment contract'' to combat
long-term unemployment, which has risen by 10% over the past year to
affect 1.2 million people. Mr Juppe will offer employers complete
exoneration of national insurance charges (which represent up to 45% of
wages) plus a #250 monthly bonus for every person they hire on the legal
minimum wage of #750 a month who has been out of work for more than a
year.
A similar scheme to help young people leaving training schemes will be
prepared by the Government and assorted reductions in insurance charges
for unskilled job will reduce the wage bill of French employers by some
#6200m.
In order to stimulate production by increasing spending, the annual
increase of the legal minimum wage to take into account inflation in
July will be doubled this year to around 4%, Mr Juppe said.
The fight against homelessness -- which affects ''tens of thousands''
of people according to Mr Juppe, many more according to charities --
will be helped by the building of an extra 10,000 low-cost homes before
next winter in addition to the 20,000 planned by the outgoing
Government.
Without quoting sums, Mr Juppe announced an increase in state pensions
on July 1 and the creation in the autumn of an ''dependence allowance''
for the half million elderly French people who are dependent on their
families. The allowance is expected in turn to create 50,000 jobs. A new
''parental allowance'', payable after the birth of a first child, will
also be introduced to help parents employ childminders.

It tells of their griefs, their pride, their endurance and their
romantic longings
Laurie Booth looked to South America for influences to meld into his
particular dance vocabulary. The result, says Mary Brennan, is
marvellous grace.
FOR the umpteenth time that day a body hit the floor at speed. The
costumes varied, the music differed, but as he stared at the screen it
seemed to Laurie Booth that the dancers on every film had the same move.
''Everyone seemed to be doing Eurocrash. I tell you, I got really
depressed by the state of the duet in British contemporary dance!
Eurocrash -- well, it seemed so simplistic, so naive, in what it
offered. Couples would spend all their energies tossing each other aside
. . . and then the next film, you'd have it all over again.''
Two days were given over to this. And nigh on 300 films. (He was at
the Dance Film Festival in Frankfurt.) Then, just as terminal boredom
was about to take hold, the screen filled with images of couples dancing
together. Bodies actually touching, bodies moving with a simmering
intensity through a dialogue of mutual attraction and seduction. Booth
was utterly beguiled.
''It was a documentary, shot in Buenos Aires, and it was about tango.
And some of the movements -- fabulous. So fabulous. But it was also
something that was really going on, had meaning in people's lives. There
was a real spark, a real interaction between the men and women. It just
stood out, head and shoulders, from the rest of the stuff.'' Months
later, back in London, and Laurie Booth was selecting his partners for
Tango Variations.
It's not the first time that Booth has looked to South America for
influences to meld into his particular dance vocabulary. Over several
years he has, for instance, developed understanding and considerable
skill in Capoiera, a form of Brazilian martial art that relies not just
on speed but on a kind of ''held'' strength -- the ability to be poised,
still, for periods of time without faltering or losing balance. In
Booth, this translates into a marvellous prowly grace, superb stamina
and the power to command a performance space without moving a muscle.
His own work makes bold use of improvisation. This, I hasten to add,
doesn't mean that he and his company fall on stage and make it up as
they go along. Obviously there's a ground-plan of how the piece shapes
and unfolds. But Booth has a real resist to anything routinely formulaic
-- hence his dismay at endless hours of whizzing kids doing Eurocrash
body slams and nose-dives.
Something like Capoeira, with its honing of response times, its
nurturing of instinctive reactions, lent itself easily to Booth's
preference for movement that could arise spontaneously from within a
given situation -- such as the coming together of two people.
But Tango was a totally new territory. For one thing, he would be
following in someone else's steps. ''Yes, this was something of a first
for me. But in fact, it wasn't such a problem. Because what I wanted to
do was go back, find what the basic steps were, and then use them as
building blocks to make my own exploration of the dance. It was almost
an archaeological dig. You unearth these traces, then you reconstruct
them.''
Helping him in this process of excavation and assembly was Juan
Cedron. Booth could hardly have wished for a more talismanic figure to
join in the preparations for Tango Variations.
For 30 years Cedron and his celebrated quartet have lived, made and
played tango. More than that, Cedron and his music have kept alive a
core image of Argentina for those who -- like himself, in 1972 --
reluctantly embraced exile in Europe in order to escape the worst
excesses of an illiberal regime. Cedron not only knew what went into
tango, he knew what tango meant in terms of cultural identity.
Tango -- true tango, not the hard-angled somewhat Prussian
step-sequences of ballroom tango -- is part of Argentine DNA. Like
flamenco or fado, it embodies the gut passions of a people. It tells of
their griefs, their pride, their endurance and their romantic longings.
Polite society has, for the most part, looked askance at the overt
sexuality of the dance. But their prissy reaction has, if anything,
added defiant fuel to the fiery display.
Certainly when Booth watched that documentary in Frankfurt, he was
immediately struck by the eroticism, the emotion, the sheer personal
energy, that flooded through the dance. ''I kept wondering what could I
-- what would I -- make of the basic raw material. I wanted something
much more improvised than any of the ballroom dance, and I didn't want
to get involved with the cultural meanings of tango.
''I wanted to, I suppose, get inside the steps. Define them. Then move
off from that, into different reiterations of tango form. See where it
lead, before coming back to the beginnings.''
Cedron, curious to see what new slant Booth could bring to the beloved
tradition, readily agreed to provide some of the music for the taped
soundscape that Hans Peter Kuhn was devising.
The final effect is not unlike walking down a street where lots of
windows are open -- as you pass by, these outbursts of tango music spill
out into the wider world, over-riding the daily grind of traffic noise.
Meanwhile, Booth and his company of six trace tango from its solo
origins to its ultimate role as high-octane innuendo without words --
the message being Adios Eurocrash! there are better things to do with
your body than splat it against inanimate objects.
* Scottish audiences have one chance to see Tango Variations -- it's
at Edinburgh Festival Theatre tonight at 7.30pm.

Exhibits currently at the Tramway in Glasgow are challenging and
deserve more than a literal interpretation, declares CHARLES ESCHE
LAST week, Channel 4 screened Atom Egoyan's film Family Viewing. It
features a media-obsessed family who can't take their eyes off the TV.
Even when their grandmother is dying and the son is having an affair
with the father's lover, they still keep watching and taping.
Egoyan is a brilliant young director who plugs straight into the heart
of our current malaise. So many of our experiences today are unreal
unless they have been recorded.
This is the age of easy entertainment. The search for pleasure seems
to have replaced redemption as the ultimate goal. ''We're not sure where
we're going but we'll have a good time getting there'' is the creed for
our irreligious, practical and pessimistic society. We can't even say
''I love you'' without thinking of Barbara Cartland. So where does art
fit in, and especially the practice of the current generation of
artists?
Much contemporary art is challenging. The audience needs to stretch
itself to accept unfamiliar and disturbing ideas of what art can be. It
is not easy or comforting. Even the gritty humour of some work is
tempered by a puritan ethic.
This art requires the viewer to work hard and makes no apology for the
demand. In some ways it is out of step with a world where things are
meant to grow ever easier -- but, as we are probably all too aware, the
manifesto of constant improvement is little more than a myth.
It is art's job to reflect upon today's world. As much as Rembrandt or
Van Gogh drew their inspiration from the people and changes around them,
so our artists look at our self-absorbed and alienated society to
comment, judge and maybe even heal.
They make use of our familiarity with video, with consumer goods, with
advertising and with designer style to communicate their ideas. They
cannot offer us a wild landscape or Monarch of the Glen because these
are not part of their lives. Modern art has always provoked and
disturbed and that is, for me, what makes it enjoyable and often deeply
satisfying.
I write this to offer another way of thinking about the current
exhibition at Tramway. When I first read Clare Henry's review, I was
disappointed that so much of the work had been written about literally.
I would Like to raise the level of debate about contemporary art and
discuss the real nature of the relationship between artists and
audiences.
Henry states that very few people are interested in visiting Tramway.
Yet, on the day she was writing her review, 600 people were enjoying a
children's circus, rehearsals for major Scottish-Canadian and
Scottish-Serbian collaborations were taking place, and 250 came to see
the exhibition.
She does make some useful points. She is right to expect us to help a
new audience look at art. But does she really think that sneering at the
work of artists in the exhibition is going to encourage an open-minded
response?
She also seems to misunderstand Tramway's place in the city. It is
meant to be ''on the edge'' and receives subsidy from both the city
council and the Scottish Arts Council to provide alternatives to the
city's other theatres and galleries.
The artistic community of the city leads the programme. It is vital to
the cultural and economic strength of the city that artists see Glasgow
as a viable place to live and work. Many now do, and Tramway plays an
important role in ensuring that continues.
Unsurprisingly, we want to increase the audience of our exhibitions
just as much as Henry. We feel a duty to help them develop an
understanding of the work, but the task is not as easy as she makes out.
We have determined that the best form of interpretation is personal. Our
gallery guides are trained and briefed with information about the
exhibition with leaflets providing background information only.
Contemporary art asks people to be perceptive and open to new ideas.
It demands time spent with the exhibition and time spent thinking about
the implications of apparently simple gestures. Every one of the
artworks in Trust wants to be investigated.
Take Felix Gonzalez-Torres' sweets. The piece, called Portrait of Dad,
is a simple pile of sweets and a picture of a father. It speaks on many
different levels -- of sweets as treats and sweets as placebos; of
fathers and sons and families and strangers; of memories and childhood
and the fat boy in the corner of the class. Each viewer will bring
something of themselves to Portrait of Dad.
There can be no correct solutions and we would be wrong to suggest
there could. It needs viewers who are willing to explore the work in
their heads and (in this case) their mouths.
Perhaps it is easiest to liken a visit to Trust to a journey. You have
to set out with a clear objective to arrive at some critical
understanding of the exhibition. There are signposts such as labels,
leaflets and conversations with the gallery guides, but in the end the
choice of destination is up to you.
To ask this of a visitor is demanding, and I understand that not
everyone has either the time or inclination to do so. Yet, for those who
go through this process the rewards are great.
* There will be a debate at Tramway about its visual arts programme
and its relationship to Glasgow at 5.15pm tonight  with Sam Ainsley
(Glasgow School of Art), Charles Esche (Tramway), Clare Henry (The
Herald), and Andrew Nairne (Scottish Arts Council). It will be chaired
by John Archer, head of BBC Scotland Music and Arts.

SOME slow handclapping, some feeble tuning, and over an hour after
some folk expected her, wee Vanessa-Mae finally flounced on last night
to a full house -- from weans to trendies to classical concert
commuters, onwards and upwards to aged 60 at least.
To say Vanessa-Mae's Red Hot tour is an oddball show is to understate.
There's something almost gothic in its set, and utterly bizarre in the
young violinist's programme -- which ranges from pseudo-Bach through
Cotton-Eyed Joe, her own set of Variations (unimaginative) on Paganini's
celebrated 24th Caprice, and a set of hits from Whitney Houston, Michael
Jackson and others. Eclectic, I guess is the word for it.
Well, no; amorphous would be more accurate. The girl can play, no
question of that. And her management is obviously cultivating the mix
'n' match classical-rock concept. But there's no real sense of focus in
it. Familiar numbers sit uneasily on her plugged-in fiddle (and the
battering volume doesn't disguise that). Unfamiliar numbers -- mostly
from her new album -- sound characterless, full of lovely but aimless
melody.
I'll give her this: in her classical set in the middle, she didn't
give them sweeties. It was in at the deep end with the finale from
Shostakovich's Second Piano Trio -- as tough as they come. Some Viennese
schmaltz from Kreisler softened the blow. (All of it, miked-up, was
tinny and harsh.) And she talks too much: it all sounds a bit twee and
gauche.
Frankly, and from the heart of an oldster, the opening acoustic set
from Kiki Dee -- intimate, throaty songs with the husky warbler and
blues shouter as good as ever -- was preferable.

Amsterdam, Wednesday
A 15-YEAR-OLD boy today became the first member of a Dutch criminal
gang suspected of brutal serial killings to be convicted for murder.
The boy, known only as D Peeters, is the youngest member of the
so-called Venlo Gang, a band of 22 males and one female arrested last
year in connection with multiple murders of immigrants and Dutch people
during 1993 and 1994.
Some victims were killed with knives, others butchered with spades and
meat hooks.
Peeters stood trial for the murder of three illegal Turkish immigrants
in the small town of Venlo, southern Netherlands. He was found guilty on
one count of murder and sentenced to serve at least six years in an
institute for the criminally insane.
The public prosecutors say they have evidence the gang murdered at
least seven people and possibly many more.
''Under interrogation, the suspects talked of many more murders,''
said a spokesman. ''But there is a legal basis on which we decide to
call something a murder case, and that applies to seven victims at the
moment. I cannot speak about the other killings because I don't know
whether we can prove them. We need more time to finish our
investigations.''

Washington, Wednesday
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton lives in a house that is all too often a target
for intrusion and attack by the disgruntled, the angry, and the just
plain crazy.
When pistol-packing Leland William Modjeski jumped the White House
fence he joined a list of intruders dating from the 1840s, when a
drunken painter threw rocks at President John Tyler as he strolled not
far from the spot where Modjeski was intercepted.
Ironically enough, the White House has proven to be a safe place for
Presidents and their families even though it has been assaulted over the
years by helicopter, plane, truck, cars, and a man with a semi-automatic
rifle.
None of the four assassinated US Presidents -- Abraham Lincoln, James
Garfield, William McKinley, and John Kennedy -- was in the White House
when he was killed. Nor were any of the other Presidents who have been
attacked over the years.
Harry Truman, President from 1945 to 1953, used to take his ''morning
constitutional'' stroll through downtown Washington accompanied by one
Secret Service agent even after a 1952 assassination attempt by Puerto
Rican nationalists.
In 1974, the nineteenth-century White House gates were reinforced
after a man named Marshall Fields strapped flares to his body on
Christmas Day, declared he was the Messiah and crashed his car on to the
grounds before giving himself up.
White House fence-jumpers are common, says the Secret Service. They
are pranksters, peaceful protestors, or sometimes mentally ill. There
have been 25 in the past five years.
In December, 1975, one of them roamed the grounds for an hour and a
half and approached President Gerald Ford's daughter in the driveway.
The rest never made it that far.
In February, 1974, Army Private Robert Preston buzzed the White House
grounds in a stolen helicopter and was shot down.
Just last September 12, a man named Frank Eugene Corder flew a stolen
Cessna 150L light plane into the back side of the White House, killing
himself but harming no-one else.
Francisco Duran, 26, a drifter from Colorado, is awaiting sentencing
next month for firing 30 rounds from a Chinese-made assault weapon
through the White House fence last October 29.--Reuter.

A FORMER solicitor is due to stand trial at the High Court in Glasgow
in November on fraud and embezzlement charges involving more than #3m.
The trial of Mr Giles Davies, 41, was set for trial in Glasgow next
month, but his counsel, Mr Neville Shaffer QC, told Lord Ross, the Lord
Justice Clerk, at a preliminary hearing in Edinburgh yesterday that his
client was unwell.
Mr Iain Bonomy, QC, Advocate-depute, told the court that the 12-month
time limit for bringing Mr Davies to trial would expire on July 4 and he
asked Lord Ross for the time limit to be extended to November 30.
Mr Shaffer said he was not opposing the time extension.
Mr Davies, who practised in Dumfries and Newton Stewart, faces three
charges. The first alleges that between December 23, 1983, and May 13,
1992, while acting as a solicitor in Newton Stewart and Dumfries, he
embezzled #1,780,598 and #610,658, the latter sum in dollars.
The second charge states that between December 20, 1991, and May 13,
1992, again while acting as a solicitor, he embezzled #1,153,927.
The third charge on the indictment alleges that he obtained #48,000 by
fraud between February 19, 1985, and February 22, 1985, by pretending
that he had been engaged as a solicitor with a power of attorney to
purchase a property in Ayrshire and that a bridging loan of #48,000 was
required.
The Crown alleges that Mr Davies, of Corwar House, Barrhill, Ayrshire,
did not hold a power of attorney, that no such bridging loan was
required, and that by means of the pretence, he obtained the #48,000 by
fraud.

pleasant surprise yesterday.
As she prepared to quit the Himalayas thousands of pounds worth of
climbing clothes and equipment which she had feared lost in an avalanche
at the weekend was recovered.
The equipment included her climbing suit and tents.
She will be home in Scotland by Saturday for a news conference at the

<TEXT>
THE Nigg oil rig yard on the Cromarty Firth was at a standstill
yesterday because of a wildcat strike by its 750-strong workforce.
The men at the steel fabrication yard walked out late on Tuesday after
holding a meeting.
The dispute seems likely to continue until the weekend.
Several hundred men at the facility are set to lose their jobs as
construction work on a series of small oil platform jackets and topsides
for Australian-owned Hamilton Oil and Gas, in Liverpool Bay fields,
nears completion.
But a platform for BP's Andrew field, in the North Sea, is still in
the early stages of construction at Nigg.
Recently the management of the yard was merged with the other main
Highland oil rig facility at Ardersier, near Inverness, under the BARMAC
banner.
Workers at Nigg say that the new American-owned consortium is not
taking into account their length of service when judging the selection
process for the coming redundancies.
Yesterday Mr Rab Wilson, an Amalgamated Engineering Union full-time
official, said that it was up to the management to speak to both
workforces collectively to clarify the jobs loss criteria.
He said Nigg workers ''seemed to be getting different signals'' from
those at Ardersier.
Yesterday a BARMAC management spokesman expressed disappointment at
the action.
He said talks about a common working agreement for both yards were
''at an advanced stage'' and that a ''final offer'' had been given to
shop-stewards.
Around 1000 jobs are expected to go at the two yards during the next
few weeks.

THE new boss of An Comunn Gaidhealach was a ''hitman'', it was
suggested at an industrial tribunal yesterday.
The tribunal, in Stornoway, was told that in his first week last year
as chief executive Mr Donald John Macsween did not speak once to the
national director, Mr Donnie Maclean, until the Friday -- when he
suspended Mr Maclean.
Even before he took up the post, Mr Macsween sent memos to Mr Maclean,
ordering staff not to speak to the press or sign cheques.
''Maybe Mr Macsween was a hitman -- it all fits in,'' said Mr
Maclean's solicitor, Mr Angus W Macdonald, in his closing submission.
Mr Maclean, 58, is claiming unfair dismissal after 16 years with the
body that organises the Royal National Mod.
Mr Macdonald said the chief executive also changed the office locks
after sending Mr Maclean home.
He questioned whether, with that background, Mr Macsween was
independent enough to conduct a fair disciplinary hearing for Mr
Maclean.
In his final submission, Mr David Walker, solicitor for An Comunn,
said the alleged use of the organisation's funds for private purchases
to be repaid later was not just ''bad practice'', as the applicant's
side had suggested.
''Even if we give the director the benefit of the doubt, which we do
not, the inference is that he was using An Comunn as some sort of
bank.''
The tribunal's findings are due in a few weeks.

SCOTLAND'S new councils must work harder to strengthen local
democracy, a leading local government specialist has warned.
Professor John Fairley, of the Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen,
said that while Scotland could be proud of the quality of many of the
services provided by local authorities, it would be difficult to take
pride in the state of our democracy.
The emphasis over the last 20 years in Scotland had been on the
effective delivery of services rather than on strengthening local
democracy.
Delivering a lecture entitled ''A new Agenda for Local Government''
last night the professor said: ''Where democracy is weak there is a
great danger that local authorities come to be seen primarily as
providers of services. This may render them quite vulnerable as there
are likely to be new, cheaper ways of delivering services as a result of
technological change.''
The difficulties facing democracy were not all new nor were they
unique to Scotland.
These weaknesses included the fact that representative democracy did
not actually represent certain groups well, including young people,
women, and ethnic minorities.
Surveys show that young people appear to lack information on voting,
he continued.
In this situation councils should consider a variety of methods of
making information available.
They should also actively seek to encourage the benefits of community
participation.
The Strathclyde region referendum on the future of water services
showed that such moves could be very effective.

Grozny, Wednesday
RUSSIAN troops clashed with Chechen separatists today in different
parts of the rebel province less than a day before peace talks were due
to start in the regional capital Grozny.
The rebels said they had attacked Kremlin troops near one of Grozny's
two airports, which federal forces have turned into a major base since
they seized the city in February.
''Chechen crack forces have now reached the northern suburbs and are
pushing back Russian guards,'' chief Chechen spokesman Movladi Udugov
said by telephone. A Russian Defence Ministry spokesman later confirmed
the heavy fighting.
But by 6pm no shooting could be heard in the heavily damaged city,
which appeared generally calm. Street vendors were busy offering goods
to people who took to the streets to enjoy the end of another hot summer
day.
The rebels accused Russians of launching a major offensive in
southeast Chechnya. Rebel commanders were quoted as saying Moscow's
forces had started all-out attacks on the southern villages of
Serzhen-Yurt, Agishty, and Dachu-Borzoi.
Russian military sources in Grozny said that their troops had used
artillery and aircraft against the separatists in the south, southeast,
and west of the region. It gave no details of the fighting.
The fresh clashes seriously marred the prospects for peace talks in
Grozny, scheduled for 10am tomorrow.--Reuter.

A MAN shouted defiance at a judge yesterday as he was jailed for life
for stabbing to death a store manager who tackled him after he was
caught shoplifting.
Carl Hughes, 19, yelled abuse as Mr Justice Kay ordered him to be
taken from the dock at Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court.
Hughes was found guilty of murdering Mr Duncan Clarke, 34, who had
tried to stop the knife-wielding shoplifter from running into an elderly
woman as he fled from a Littlewoods store in Cardiff.
The jury had heard there was no dispute that Hughes killed Mr Clarke,
who was 5ft 6in and weighed only eight stones, but he denied murder and
claimed his victim's death was manslaughter.
Sentencing Hughes, the judge told him: ''The man you killed, Duncan
Clarke, was decent and courageous and public-spirited.
''You are none of those things. It's quite clear to me having read
about your history that you are a vicious young thug and on that day you
became a ruthless killer.
''It's my impression that anybody who gets in your way is in
considerable danger. The public will need to be protected from you for a
very long time.''
The court heard that Hughes, from Penrhys, Rhondda, Mid Glamorgan, had
a history of violent crime and had been in prison a few months before he
killed Mr Clarke.
He was serving 15 months youth custody for a series of offences which
included pulling a knife and threatening a police officer after being
confronted on suspicion of shoplifting.
During a later arrest, he beat a policeman with a snooker cue.
The jury heard that Hughes stabbed Mr Clarke in the chest with a
three-inch knife last November.
Hughes was being chased after breaking free from a store detective
while being taken back into Littlewoods for stealing a box of lego.
He left Mr Clarke lying in a pool of blood.
Mr Clarke, from Canton, Cardiff, was manager of a handbag sales
franchise at Littlewoods and had rushed to help after hearing the
commotion.
The court was told that Hughes had been in council care since the age
of five and had never had a job.
He gave no evidence in his defence at the trial.
His barrister, Mr Leighton Davies QC, said: ''All we can hope is that
his young age means he will have time ahead of him to mature.''

Washington, Wednesday
ISRAEL and Syria have reached a framework understanding on security
arrangements and their military experts will discuss details in
Washington before the end of June, US Secretary of State Warren
Christopher announced today.
In a statement read by his spokesman, Nicholas Burns, Mr Christopher
said US special Middle East co-ordinator Dennis Ross would visit the
region next week and he himself would tour the Middle East soon
afterwards.
''I am pleased to announce that following the visits to Washington of
(Israeli) Prime Minister (Yitzhak) Rabin and (Syrian) Foreign Minister
(Farouq al-) Shara . . . a set of understandings on security
arrangements has now been reached,'' Mr Christopher said.
''This constitutes a general terms of reference, on which senior
military experts from Israel and Syria will meet under our auspices to
try to reach agreement on the security arrangements.''
The Israeli and Syrian ambassadors to Washington have been meeting
regularly since March to discuss security arrangements that would
guarantee a proposed Israeli withdrawal on the Golan Heights, captured
by Israel in 1967.
The talks have bogged down over a set of principles for the
arrangements, including a Syrian demand that they should be ''equal''.
Mr Christopher's announcement indicated that this problem had been
resolved but that the military experts would have to negotiate the
substance of the arrangements, such as the depth of demilitarized zones
on either side of the border and the nature of early warning systems.
He gave no precise dates for his Middle East trip except to say that
it would precede the military experts' talks in Washington. His schedule
suggests it would have to come some time after a trip to Haiti June 4-5.
Mr Burns told a news briefing that Mr Christopher had spoken on the
telephone twice to Mr Shara within the past 24 hours, suggesting that
details of the outline accord had been wrapped up then.--Reuter.

<HEADLINE>Court told of directors' excesses. Sheriff bans extravagant property men</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>978223354</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
TWO former directors of a retail property firm have been disqualified
from holding other directorships after the company crashed, owing more
than #1m.
Mr Hamish Henderson, former chairman of Caledon Park plc, was
disqualified by a sheriff for seven years. His fellow board member, Mr
Ian Ross, was banned for six years.
A case was brought by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry at
Edinburgh Sheriff Court, under the Company Directors' Disqualification
Act 1986.
The court heard that the men received ''excessive'' salaries and
benefits while the firm was struggling.
They ate and drank for free at a bar/restaurant leased by the firm,
and used it for private and family entertaining.
Each man ran two cars, a ''prestige'' one for himself and another
smaller one for his wife.
Mr Henderson, on a salary of #65,000, drove a #39,000 Jaguar XJ6 while
Mr Ross, paid #40,000 a year, had a BMW 730 worth #31,000. They also
incurred numerous parking fines, which were unpaid when the firm went
into liquidation.
Even without the cars and entertaining, 45% of the losses of Caledon
Park in the last three-and-a-half years up to June 1992 was due to the
directors' salaries.
The three-man board at the time of the liquidation also included an
accountant who was the finance director.
When the company did go under, the Bank of Scotland lost #582,987 and
other smaller creditors lost a total of #167,546.
Preferential creditors, including the Inland Revenue and the DSS for
tax and National Insurance, and the firm's employees, got 43p in the #.
Sheriff Isobel Poole heard that the firm, based at Orchard Brae House
in Edinburgh, was involved in five projects between its launch in 1986
and its liquidation.
An office development in Edinburgh's King's Stables Road was
successfully completed in 1989 and a joint venture with GA Properties in
Glenrothes, Fife, was completed and partially let when the firm failed.
Other projects at Maybury Road, Edinburgh, and in Aberdeen and Dundee,
however, ran into problems with such things as planning permission,
withdrawal of capital backers, and with Caledon Park failing to pay
professional fees.
It was decided not to sell the Glenrothes site until November 1993,
when it was hoped that a better price could be obtained.
Sheriff Poole found that it was, therefore, of crucial importance for
the firm to keep going until then and, to do that, it had to service its
loans, pay its bills, and not otherwise spend too much cash.
The company failed to keep going and the sheriff decided that the two
men had caused the firm to trade while insolvent, to the detriment of
its creditors.
They were also responsible for receiving ''excessive remuneration'',
for the ''unjustifiable and extravagant lease purchase agreements over
motor cars'' and for the ''misapplication of company monies in
entertainment which was extravagant''.
The sheriff said it was not unfair to describe the men's continuing to
''entertain'' and take perks in the form of meals and drink when the
company was struggling as ''outrageous''.
For their part, Mr Henderson and Mr Ross argued that their salaries
were not out of line with other similar firms' and that #72,000 spent on
entertaining over 40 months was not excessive.
''It was 'power-eating' and a fact of life in the property sphere,''
they said.
The cars were also a small item of expenditure and were necessary for
getting to important meetings and for ferrying important clients about.
When the firm went into liquidation Mr Ross managed to pay #8500
towards the full price of his shares in the company, but Mr Henderson
paid nothing.
For that reason Sheriff Poole decided to disqualify Mr Henderson for a
longer period.

<TEXT>
TWO married couples were among the 10 people who died in the Royal
British Legion coach crash on the M4 motorway, police said last night.
As crash investigators continued to search the scene and examine the
coach, police said driver Stephen Brown, 38, had told them he swerved to
avoid an object on the carriageway.
Mr Brown, a father-of-three, who escaped with minor injuries, told
police about the object during preliminary interviews.
Chief Inspector Jeff Brommage, deputy head of the Traffic Department
of Avon and Somerset Police, declined to describe the object reported by
the coach driver, but said ''one or two'' other witnesses might also
have seen it.
Police will question Mr Brown and the other witnesses in greater
detail at a later stage, but meanwhile they are ''urgently seeking'' the
driver of a blue vehicle close to or possibly in front of the coach
before the accident.
It could be that he, or possibly passengers, witnessed something of
the accident, said Mr Brommage, who appealed for any other witnesses to
contact police.
Preliminary examination by investigators from the Department of
Transport and police had found no faults in the coach's steering,
linkages or tyres, he said.
The tachograph showed the driving was within speed limits and the
driver had passed a breath-test soon after the crash.
In Christchurch, Dorset, flags flew at half-mast as family and friends
of passengers who died when the coach plunged off the motorway and
overturned, waited for news.
Ten of the 20 survivors from the legion group who were returning from
a day's outing to a Cardiff brewery are being treated at hospitals in
Bristol.
Police named six of those who died, including Christchurch married
couples John and Ivy Metcalf, both 86, who had both served in the armed
services during the Second World War; and 70-year-old William Cooper and
his wife Peggy, 66.
The other two were William Davis, 87, also from Christchurch, and
James Walsh, 68, from New Milton, Hampshire.
Two other passengers have been identified but their details would not
be released until today, a police spokesman said. Two more victims had
yet to be formally identified.
The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh have sent a message of sympathy to
the Royal British Legion, saying they were ''shocked to hear of the
tragic accident''.

THE Glasgow University academics whose work was allegedly
''sanitised'' by the Scottish Arts Council yesterday called on the
quango to retract any suggestions that they were professionally
incompetent.
They also demanded that SAC statements which implied they had exceeded
their brief or that methods were flawed should be withdrawn.
The Herald revealed on Tuesday that numerous criticisms of the SAC in
the original academic study were edited from the version for public
release.
The study, on artists' lifestyles, had found the arts council was too
bureaucratic, secretive, and unresponsive to the needs of those it was
supposed to represent.
The SAC's depute director, Ms Christine Hamilton, subsequently
justified the editing, mainly on grounds that the five-strong research
team from the Departments of Sociology and Social and Economic Research
had exceeded the brief, or on need to cut down on ''muddle''.
Yesterday, on behalf of the researchers, team leader Bert Moorhouse
issued a statement which clearly demonstrated their anger at perceived
attacks on their professionalism.
He said the team rejected any hints that the original report was
rewritten by the arts council because it detected flaws in research
methods or in the way the findings were presented.
He said the brief was followed closely by the team. The remit had
ranged from examining key problems affecting artists' professional lives
to reviewing SAC methods of assistance.

A FOOTBALL player who drove his car on to the pitch towards the
referee was sentenced yesterday to 150 hours of community service.
Goalkeeper Robert Crooks, 25, was so incensed by Mr Denis Cunningham's
decisions that he had already run the length of the pitch to abuse him.
Then, after being ushered to the changing rooms, Crooks, of Telford
Drive, Drylaw, Edinburgh, emerged with a broom handle, shouting: ''I'm
going to kill him.''
He was then thrown out of the sports ground altogether, but returned
in his car and drove on to the pitch at 30-50mph.
The depute procurator-fiscal, Mrs Anne Keenan, said that he was going
in the direction of the referee but, when Mr Cunningham moved out of the
way, did not steer towards him.
Crooks had been playing for Telford United against Carrick Hearts.
Edinburgh Sheriff Court heard yesterday that Crooks had been banned
for life from all organised football.
Crooks had admitted a breach of the peace in Union Park, Saughton Road
North, Edinburgh, by shouting and swearing and threatening violence to
Mr Cunningham.
He also admitted having an offensive weapon and another breach of the
peace by driving on to the pitch towards Mr Cunningham and putting him
in fear for his safety.

RACING greyhounds have been slaughtered by being thrown into a
rubbish-filled quarry pool and left to drown, according to the SSPCA.
The owners were not willing to pay to have them put down humanely by a
vet.
SSPCA inspectors revealed the seven rotting corpses yesterday. Some of
the dogs had first been knocked unconscious. One had had its skull
caved-in by a hammer before it was tossed into the pool.
Two had bricks tied around their necks and were bundled into sacks
before being dumped in the water. The rope had cut deep into their flesh
as they struggled to escape.
The SSPCA inspectors went to the quarry near Chapelhall, Lanarkshire,
and found the bodies after an anonymous tip off. They think children
playing at the quarry made the discovery, then made the phone call.
The investigators are keen to find the killers. They say the dogs have
been dumped there over a period ranging from a few days ago to several
weeks.
An attempt is being made to copy ear dog tag numbers from the animals
to try to trace owners.
However, dogs are sold on so often that tracing the last owner through
the original owner can be almost impossible.
SSPCA inspector Jim McCandlish said: ''Their killing was barbaric. The
poor dogs were obviously killed because they were simply not up to
scratch in the racing world.
''The dogs would have trustingly followed their owners up there quite
happily. If they were no longer wanted they should have been put down in
a humane manner by a vet.
''They had probably made their owners a pile of money in the past. But
it seems the dogs weren't worth looking after when they had passed their
prime.''

<TEXT>
CHRISTIANS must dispel the myth that sexual desire is unhealthy and
take a ''more straightforward attitude to sex'', the Bishop of Edinburgh
said last night.
In the second of his four seminars on sex and Christianity, the Most
Rev Richard Holloway, 61, said that he knew many of his remarks would
provoke controversy.
Referring to the headlines he created last week when was reported to
have said adulterers should not be condemned, he said he was glad his
comments had led to an ''open and productive'' discussion on sex and its
place within the church.
He went on to reveal that he had abandoned plans to become a monk
because ''he couldn't hack celibacy'' and confessed that his early
religious beliefs had left him in a state of sexual confusion.
He told an audience of more than 100 that he had once believed that
God would not approve of him unless he remained a virgin, and that when
he married his wife, Jean, 32 years ago he had felt trapped in a moral
dilemma.
The head of the Scottish Anglican Church told his congregation: ''Many
Christians have an unnatural attitude to sex.
''It seems we find ourselves genetically geared as sexual beings, but
we believe that God does not want us to express our sexuality.
''I was sent to a monastery when I was aged just 14, before I had even
reached puberty, and I honestly believed that if I wanted the approval
of God I had to be celibate.
''Eventually I left the monastery because I couldn't hack celibacy.''
In his closing remarks he said: ''To the question 'What is sex for',
biologically we know it is for the propagation of the species.
''But it should be remembered it is not simply procreative. It is
delightful and it is enjoyable.''

New York, Wednesday
SHE was once ''the world's richest girl'' and she grew up to become a
woman who believed that while you could not buy people, you could rent
them.
Now in death, tobacco heiress Doris Duke's oft-expressed theories
about people's fickleness and greed is being put to the test in a legal
battle over her will that could tie up her #750m estate for years to
come. The cast of characters could fit comfortably into any Hollywood
mini-series.
There is a disinherited adopted daughter plucked from the Hare Krishna
movement, a hard-bitten former New York prosecutor who suspects foul
play, two pet camels, a posse of doctors, a horde of lawyers,
disgruntled servants and -- in a starring role -- an alcoholic,
near-illiterate butler.
New York Surrogate Court Judge Eve Preminger on Monday dismissed
Irish-born butler Bernard Lafferty as the executor of Ms Duke's estate,
calling him greedy. She charged that Mr Lafferty squandered hundreds of
thousands of dollars on a ''profligate lifestyle'' that included
alcoholic binges, spending more than #400,000 on antiques, surrounding
himself with bodyguards, sleeping in Ms Duke's bed at her Los Angeles
mansion and having the estate pick up all his living expenses.
Although Ms Duke died in October 1993 at age 80, Mr Lafferty increased
the number of people working at her estates.
The judge based her ruling on a scathing report prepared for her by
former New York City prosecutor Richard Kuh.
Lawyers for Mr Lafferty cried foul, saying Ms Preminger never put Mr
Kuh's conclusions to a court hearing where they could be challenged.
They said they would appeal. Meanwhile, legal fees for Mr Lafferty and
the trust company he appointed to help him oversee the estate total more
than #8m so far.
Ms Preminger declined to comment on Mr Kuh's most sensational charge
-- that a doctor hastened Ms Duke's death by giving her a lethal dose of
morphine. The day after she died, Mr Lafferty, her closest companion in
the last year of her life, had her body cremated. Her own wish was to be
''fed to the sharks''.
Ms Duke was controversial in life as well as in death. She inherited
#180m in 1925, when she was 12 years old, and one of her first acts as
an heiress was to sue her mother to stop her from selling the family
estate. She later outraged neighbours by keeping pet camels.

Derek Reid looks at how Scotland has been stealing the show in recent
Hollywood productions such as Rob Roy -- winning fans across the world
who could become tourists
EDINBURGH may never have seen anything quite like this. Underneath the
magnificent skyline of the Old Town, 600 of the great, the good and the
fortunate, dressed in their finery, stepped out to launch a film made in
Scotland and funded in Hollywood.
Just what Rob MacGregor would have made of it is anyone's guess. There
was champagne, there was seafood, there was music; and there was trout
swimming under the dance floor.
Scots going to work the morning after the European premiere of Rob Roy
could be forgiven for believing that this display was at best
entertaining, at worst decadent, and irrelevant.
Yet the commercial success of Rob Roy could have a significant impact
on an industry that supports 180,000 Scottish jobs and generates #2
billion each year in the local economy. Tourism is Scotland's largest
industry, and in many areas of Scotland is the only industry with
realistic prospects of growth. But too often in the past the Scots have
regarded tourism as a ''candy floss'' industry, the received wisdom
being that unless you are hewing coal, building ships or pressing steel
you are not engaged in ''real'' employment.
Sadly, those industries are no longer the bedrock of the Scottish
economy. Nor are they likely to return and form the basis of a
manufacturing-led future. We have to face facts; and the fact is that if
Scotland is to prosper, then tourism must become recognised and
developed as a serious industry with unfulfilled potential.
Worldwide, tourism is growing at 5% per annum. That Scotland has not
kept pace with that growth over recent years is largely due to a decline
in the English market, a lack of cohesion within the industry and a lack
of resources for marketing and for capital investment in infrastructure.
Prescriptions for these problems will take time but encouragingly the
medicine is starting to work.
Throughout the world, competition in tourism is organised,
professional and well resourced. Scotland, a small nation, can never
out-spend our competitors, but we can outperform them. To do so, we need
to recognise opportunities as they arise, and exploit them.
In Rob Roy, Michael Caton Jones has presented Scottish tourism with a
gilt-edged opportunity, on two levels. First, the film stars Liam
Neeson, Jessica Lange and Scotland. The glory of the Highlands has never
been more vividly displayed than in this production. Secondly, the
film's production budget was $30m and its promotional budget $20m, and
it will be screened in every country in the world where there is a
cinema.
Those sums of money completely eclipse the budgets available to the
Scottish Tourist Board for marketing Scotland.
For such a beautiful country, Scotland has never been accurately
depicted by Hollywood. Leaving aside the embarrassment of Brigadoon, the
last film that made an impact in tourism terms was Local Hero, starring
Burt Lancaster. Visitors to Pennan, on the Moray coast, still queue
outside the famous telephone box near the beach to have their pictures
taken. The Highlander films, too, acquired cult status, particularly in
Germany and France. But both of these films were on a restricted release
and were not what the movie people call mainstream motion pictures.
Suddenly, in 1994, Hollywood came to Scotland in the form of Rob Roy,
Braveheart (Mel Gibson), Loch Ness (Ted Danson) and Mary Reilly (Julia
Roberts, John Melkevich). Scottish Screen Locations deserve praise for
playing a leading role in bringing these films to Scotland. Clearly,
there is a strong argument for strengthening this organisation, enabling
us to compete on equal terms with countries like Ireland.
At the Scottish Tourist Board, we believe that of the four films shot
in Scotland last year, Rob Roy remains the one with the greatest
potential to stimulate tourism. For four reasons:
* It was shot entirely on location in Scotland
* It has a Scottish director (Michael Caton Jones)
* A Scottish soundtrack (Capercaille)
* Lastly, and crucially, it presents Scotland's unique scenery in the
way it should be portrayed, in wide-screen panoramic splendour.
Further reasons for our excitement are that there are plenty of
examples around of TV programmes and films that have stimulated tourism.
Anyone who has been to Boston will have seen the healthy queue that
forms each day outside the famous Cheers bar.
Here at home, Granada TV's Coronation Street studio is one of the most
popular visitor attractions in the UK. Dances with Wolves made Kevin
Costner's name, but also secured a prosperous future for tourism to
South Dakota.
But perhaps the best example of Hollywood-led tourism is Crocodile
Dundee, starring Paul Hogan. The Australian Tourism Commission had
already recruited Hogan to present its new advertising campaign in the
US when the Crocodile Dundee films were made. The success of the films
-- and the imagery of Australia on the screen -- presented the
Australian Tourism Commission with the ideal conduit through which to
promote a tourism message. Americans responded to that message and
tourism from the United States to Australia increased by 20% and has
since been consolidated.
Can Scotland achieve similar results with Rob Roy, Braveheart and the
rest? Time will tell. But it would be negligent of us to let an
opportunity like this slip through our fingers. That is why the Scottish
Tourist Board has been working alongside MGM, United Artists and others
to stimilate tourism associated with the film in America, in Europe and
in the UK.
In the days before Edinburgh's big party, the first Rob Roy visitors
had begun to appear in the Tourist Information Centre in Callander. They
were American, they had seen the film, and had re-arranged their holiday
in London to take in Rob Roy country. They will assuredly be followed by
many more, all of them requiring accommodation, good food and excellent
service. If Scotland fulfils their expectations, our tourist industry
could be the lead player in the long-term regeneration of Scottish
industry.

Jeddah, Wednesday
MORE than 500 tourists were aboard a blaze-hit cruise liner today as
it was being towed to the Saudi port of Jeddah.
The fire crippled the luxury ship's engines and left it drifting in
the Red Sea under a baking sun.
Passengers mustered on the decks of the 27,000-tonne Albatros when
fire broke out early yesterday. No-one was hurt.
Lloyd's Shipping Intelligence Service said a small fire broke out in
one of the engine room boilers. Dousing the flames left the area partly
flooded and the ship drifted for more than a day without power.

Washington, Wednesday
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton today shrugged off the latest threat to his
security as ''just another day at the White House'' after an armed
intruder was shot inside the grounds of the heavily protected mansion.
Mr Clinton's laconic comment was reported by aides as his first public
reaction to last night's episode in which both the alleged intruder and
a Secret Service guard were wounded in the left arm by a bullet fired by
another guard.
A man identified as Leland William Modjeski, 37, described by police
as armed with an unloaded handgun, scaled the spiked, wrought-iron White
House fence and was tackled some 30 to 50yds from the residence by
Secret Service guard Scott Giambattista, were wounded by a bullet fired
by another guard, authorities said.
Doctors at George Washington University Hospital who treated the two
men said both were in good condition after surgery and predicted they
would be released from the hospital within three or four days.
The incident was an embarrassment for security authorities because it
came just days after Mr Clinton had ordered new security procedures
including the closing of a section of Pennsylvania Avenue outside the
White House to traffic.
Federal prosecutors today charged Modjeski, recently fired from a
pizza delivery job, with forcibly assaulting Secret Service officers and
interstate transportation of a firearm with intent to commit a felony.
Each charge carries a maximum of 10 years in prison.
A hearing was set for next Tuesday, and prosecutors said they would

Prosecutor Eric Dubelier told reporters Modjeski did not have a
criminal record but there was some indication of past mental health
problems. He did not elaborate and said investigators were looking into
his motives.
Modjeski's neighbours in the Washington suburb of Falls Church,
Virginia, expressed shock at the arrest of a man they described as quiet
and not known as a trouble-maker.
Tony Perez, who lives a few houses away, said ''he was a really quiet
neighbour'' who seldom talked with others.
White House press secretary Mike McCurry said: ''the President was
very satisfied that he was well protected and stressed that he never
felt he was in any danger.''

Washington, Wednesday
NORTHERN Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew tonight held a historic
meeting with Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams, then said he failed to
receive the message he wanted to hear from him over the arms issue.
Sir Patrick said he had sought a positive response from Mr Adams about
weapons, but reported after the private meeting at a leading Washington
hotel which lasted just over 30 minutes: ''I regret I did not get one''.
He said he regarded the meeting as useful and added: ''I would
describe it as civil''. Sir Patrick went on: ''I conveyed the message
and I hope I conveyed it in a civil way''.
Gerry Adams said they had ''a useful meeting, a frank and friendly and
positive exchange of views''.
Sir Patrick told reporters on entering the room at the Washington
Sheraton Hotel conference venue that he would shake hands with Adams,
who arrived later and disappeaed behind a closed door.
When the two men finally met Sir Patrick immediately presented Mr
Adams with a two-page statement in which he said investment in Northern
Ireland was influenced ''especially by peace and confidence that peace
will endure.''
''Certainly investors are wisely showing more interest in Northern
Ireland, and that is very welcome; but investors in general make
decisions for the long term. They need to know that in Northern Ireland
a peace is in place which they can rely on to continue.
''Sinn Fein under your leadership can now best promote that confidence
and encourage jobs for Northern Ireland by using its influence with the
IRA to get substantial progress on the decommissioning of their stock of
arms and explosives.''
He said he would be making the same point ''just as bluntly'' to
loyalist groups.
Before the meeting began, Adams said he was willing to discuss
decommissioning arms and explosives, but wanted other issues to be
broached as well.
He said the talks should include the withdrawal of British troops from
Northern Ireland and the freeing of 800 IRA prisoners.
Afterwards Sir Patrick added: ''I left Mr Adams in no doubt about the
importance that the Government attached to substantial progress being
made by the Provisional IRA in the decommissioning of arms.
''That means getting rid of them so that cannot be used again, ever.''
On being told Adams had called their meeting ''friendly'' Sir Patick
said: ''I would describe it as civil.
''I think a meeting of that kind should be civil. I do not think an
uncivil meeting is a sensible one to have.''
''I conveyed the message, and I hope I conveyed in a civil way.''
Sir Patrick went on: ''I want to see all parties with a democratic
mandate represented. What I will not do is to sit down and negotiate
with a party that is inextricably associated with a paramilitary
organisation that is doing nothing to reduce its stock of arms. I have
made that very clear.''
He said that during a visit to Boston earlier this week he had met
potential investors who were still unsure because of the arms question.
Asked whether the meeting had brought the positions of the government
and Sinn Fein closer together, Sir Patrick replied:
''I hope that Mr Adams as a result of this meeting has a clearer idea
of the strength with which the Government holds to its view that it
cannot sit down and negotiate the future political structures of
Northern Ireland with a party that remains associated with a
paramilitary organisation that has made no progress in decommissioning
its arms.''
Sir Patrick arrived here this afternoon for President Clinton's
conference on economic development in Ireland, and went straight to a
meeting with Vice-President Al Gore and the Secretary of Commerce, Ron
Brown.

THERE is no better illustration of the difficulties of our ever-closer
union with the European powers than the publication of the consulation
document on identity cards. Many Tories welcome the prospect of more use
of identity cards, but we fear that they could be an excuse for losing
control of our borders.
At the Tory Party conference last October, the Home Secretary said:
''In time, carrying your identity card would seem as natural as carrying
a credit card is at the moment.'' The Prime Minister, we were told, was
''convinced that ID cards could help cut crime''.
The conference supported it and were critical only of the delay. The
Home Secretary said he wanted to stimulate a ''national debate'' on
identity cards. There is an easy way of starting a national debate. You
publish a document and then you make a statement in the House. After the
statement all and sundry express their opinions.
Yesterday the consultation document was published, but the Government
had no intention of making a statement. The idea of ID cards has run
into trouble. The trouble is mostly European trouble.
The document is frank. ''In many continental countries the need to
maintain checks on the population, particularly in frontier areas, has
led to the widespread use of identity cards.
''In the UK our island geography has meant that there has not been the
same need to seek to provide evidence of individual identity. . . . It
might be thought that the whole concept of an identity card is better
suited to the more codified nature of the continental legal systems, and
that the British common law tradition is not concerned with the need to
identify people going about their lawful business.''
The Single European Act of 1986 provided that ''the internal market
shall comprise an area without internal frontiers in which the free
movement of goods, persons, services and capital is ensured''.
The effect of the Act is only now coming through. We are no longer in
control of our own destiny. We can no longer rely on our own sovereign
Parliament for our laws. The European Court of Justice will pronounce
upon the meaning of the treaty. It is assumed that Britain will obey.
There are issues of huge importance which remain unresolved. It is not
clear whether we are to be obliged to dismantle our border controls in
order to allow the free movement of persons. The Government says it will
fight to keep our border controls. What happens if the court rules
against Britain?
Who are the people to be allowed free movement? European nations have
very different laws and attitudes towards their respective former
colonial territories.
Their different histories make for different attitudes towards
granting asylum. I recently came across an example of how Europe may
confound our laws on immigration.
In 1984 the Indian Army stormed the Golden Temple at Amritsar in the
Punjab. According to government sources, two or three thousand people
were killed. I am told by my Sikh constituents in Wolverhampton that
since then about 50,000 Sikhs have been granted political asylum in
Britain. However, for good historical reasons, the Germans were more
liberal than the British in granting refugee status.
It is believed that about a quarter of a million Sikhs have, since
1984, gained political asylum in Germany. If we have no border controls,
the Sikhs now in Germany could come to Wolverhampton. Our immigration
controls would be broken on the anvil of European integration.
So insidious and so successful has been the process of federal control
and advance that many of us fear a new agenda. The danger is that the
Government may persuade us to accept the introduction of ID cards for
domestic reasons. When ID cards are in place, it may then be said that
border controls are no longer necessary.
If I had to predict a cause of final rupture between the UK and
European Union, I would choose immigration. John Major, beware!

Ann Milnes Roberts recalls how a minor motoring offence in America led
to arrest, humiliation and fear because of missing ID
THE prospect of identity cards in Britain makes me recall what
happened when I said I didn't have ID in a world where it was
compulsory.
We'd been living in America for a couple of years, and I knew it was
an offence to drive without a licence. But on that warm spring day, I'd
swapped handbags and left the licence behind. Collecting my husband from
a meeting in an unfamiliar part of town, I was flagged down by two
policemen. I'd failed to spot a ''No Right Turn During Peak Hours''
sign.
I was asked to produce my licence, and when I couldn't the police
tried to check my identity on their central computer. This points up the
weak spot in any introduction of ID legislation: the computer was down.
I was arrested and taken to jail.
In the police car my bag was searched for guns and knives. I have an
artificial leg so they said that they'd refrain from putting me in
handcuffs. At the police station, I was put into a holding cell, white
tiled, no seats, with a couple of drunks and drug addicts. My
fingerprints were taken.
A policewoman entered the cell and asked me to put my hands above my
head and stand against the wall. She donned rubber gloves and ran her
hands over me in a body search. Nothing in my life has ever been so
degrading. And all the time, more and more suspects were being put into
the cell: men, women, drug addicts, drunks, prostitutes, non-licence
carriers.
After an hour, the central computer came on line, confirming my
identity, and a shamefaced sergeant, embarrassed that his men had spent
so much time on such an unlikely criminal, invited me out of the cell
into his office. The clerk continued with my paperwork. She yelled
across the police station: ''Can the suspect read and write?'' The
sergeant nodded his head wearily. ''She's a journalist. I guess she
reads and writes pretty well.'' All this time I'd been taking notes. He
saw trouble ahead.
My husband turned up with my licence. I paid a $10 fine and was free
to go. The events of that afternoon changed the way I saw the world.
Later I described what had happened to me on a radio programme and the
station was flooded with calls from other women.
One doctor was stopped as she rushed to hospital. Wearing a white coat
and stethoscope, she was handcuffed, taken to the station and held until
someone brought in her licence. A mother with her baby, driving to meet
the school bus, was arrested, baby and all, unable to get a message to
her waiting child.
I've told this story whenever people argue that the righteous have
nothing to fear from the police and that nobody with a clear conscience
should object to carrying identity cards. Some say that I knew the law,
and had only myself to blame. But be careful. ID cards might be fine
most of the time, but a determined law breaker isn't going to refrain
from crime because he might be stopped and asked for ID.
And once the police have this power, it will be blacks, teenagers,
travellers, people on the fringes of society who will get hurt -- and
once in a while, middle-aged, middle-class, disabled women. And with no
written constitution or Freedom of Information Act Britain will have
taken another dangerous step along the authoritarian road.

A PLEA to seek ways of establishing more crofts in the Highlands was
made yesterday by Kirk elder Iain MacGregor, of Kishorn, Ross-shire, who
brought a little of the crofter culture to the General Assembly by
introducing himself in Gaelic, and later reciting a poem in Gaelic
verse. His call, backed by churchmen, urged the Government to seek ways
and means of adding further crofts to those already in existence in the
North of Scotland.
He said many crofts which had formerly been working concerns were now
fallow, to the detriment of others and the local environment, and, under
the present system, could not be regenerated. He went on to reveal that
there was a huge demand for crofts, and said new legislation was
required to make land available for new crofts and to regenerate those
which had become disused. A new wave of crofting could have a spin-off
for the community, he claimed.

James Freeman examines whether national identity cards would be a
valuable, if expensive, weapon against crime, or whether the money could
be better spent on more conventional and less controversial methods of
policing
THE introduction of a national identity card scheme in the UK might
cost as much as #500m, with an annual running cost of #100m. The
question on the lips of many people concerned by crime in general is
whether this vast sum of money would not be better spent on the police
service rather than on a scheme which is bound to be controversial and
may be of dubious value.
The police service, it has to be said, is not the driving force behind
the current debate, though that has not always been the case in recent
years.
Time and again the police have proved that they can reverse the rising
graph of recorded crime; one key factor, if the circumstantial evidence
is to be believed, has to be full staffing. The freeing up of officers
by the employment of more civilians in desk jobs has proved a major
route to success but, of course, chief constables need more cash to
carry on doing this.
Pumping #500m into the police, as opposed to the vast array of
measures currently flowing from the Home Office designed to cut the cash
spent on the police, could have an enormous beneficial effect on
communities everywhere.
However, leaving aside this argument, most police are in favour of ID
cards to a greater or lesser degree. Mr Ron Hadfield, chairman of the
international affairs advisory committee of the Association of Chief
Police Officers (ACPO), the English organisation, and chief constable of
West Midlands Police, summed up the mood by extending a muted welcome to
Home Secretary Michael Howard's consultation paper, while emphasising
that the police are not forcing the debate.
He then reverted to perhaps the weakest of the pro-card arguments --
that the ability to prove identity using a multi-purpose identification
card would give many advantages to the holder.
ACPO favour a voluntary scheme and believe that, once introduced,
people would take to the cards to the extent that it would become
increasingly difficult to operate without one.
In advance of the green paper, the English organisation, Justice, said
there was no research, either in the UK or in countries which have ID
card schemes, to support the view that the cards would be an effective
counter measure against crime.
On the other hand, the experienced people at the top of the Scottish
Police Federation, the voice of grass-roots policing, say that a
national identity card would be a protection for the law-abiding citizen
against fraud, theft by bogus workmen and ''many other crimes committed
by people pretending to be someone they are not''.
Banks, building societies and other organisations who already issue
cards would stand to benefit, federation secretary Douglas Keil said
yesterday, adding -- perhaps significantly -- that ID cards would make
the job of the police that much easier by reducing the time taken in
confirming identities.
The banks and building societies are, of course, well able, with their
vast profits, to introduce fraud-proof plastic cards with photographs
and fingerprints which, with the available swipe technology, would wipe
out card fraud at a stroke. It is merely a matter of willingness to
spend the money. The Royal Bank paved the way, an industry source saying
yesterday that their pilot scheme of cards with photos had been an
unqualified success. Not once had such a card been used fraudulently or
forged.
Also on the police front, while the Northern Ireland experience of the
past 25 years perhaps sets it apart, some useful lessons have emerged.
An RUC source points out that the NI driving licence carries a
photograph and, although the law through the UK is the same in that a
driver has five days in which to produce his licence at a police
station, the licence-with-photo proved useful to countless NI people
stopped at checkpoints and asked to identify themselves.
It became a useful tool for the police and a quick, foolproof and
welcome ID for decent people who were giving their beleaguered police
force their support against the terrorists.
Any debate will have to address the idea of privacy in a modern
Western-style democracy, although few could define precisely what
privacy means. If it is taken as a person's right to remain undisturbed
and to have freedom from intrusion, then that would surely include
physical intrusion such as the necessity to carry and produce an
identity card.
Then there is the whole area of who has a right to the information
contained on any smart card. If I have a criminal conviction, or am HIV
positive, should such information be available to the counter clerk in
the bank or the DSS, or anyone else with a machine capable of reading
the magnetic strip? Should my local police station be able to tell at a
glance how much, or how little, I have in my bank account?
John McFall, MP for Dumbarton, said yesterday that the Home
Secretary's consultation was a cop-out; that he had been reined in by
his Cabinet colleagues and by the Prime Minister, who is on the record
in Birmingham last month as saying that ID cards ''would not deter
crime''.
But he welcomes the debate which he -- along with practically everyone
else -- suspects may be complex, counter productive and ultimately
inconclusive. With Mr Howard's recent record in relation to the police
and crime, many will conclude that this is yet another ''magic bullet''
solution which has little chance of success.

A CALL for a crackdown on law and order failed to find support with
the General Assembly yesterday.
The Rev James Black of East Kilbride asked the Assembly to support a
tough call to the Government for more police resources and to encourage
the wider use of close-circuit television in town centres in the fight
against crime.
Mr Black also called for a review of the sentencing policy for violent
crime and of the life imprisonment penalty which he claimed gave rise to
''confusion and cynicism'' among the general public.
He claimed many people did not realise sentences of under four years
were automatically halved, while a life sentence meant 10 or 11 years.
''It seems that the criminal justice system is no longer mirroring the
urge society feels when you hear of attacks,'' he said.
The Assembly supported the case for more resources but rejected the
appeal to clamp down on criminals when a vote was taken.

AS the Kirk called on all paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland to
lay down their arms yesterday, the Moderator of the Presbyterian Church
in Ireland thanked ministers for their prayers for peace.
In an impassioned address during the influential Church and Nation
Committee's debate on international affairs, the Rt Rev Dr David
McGaughey said: ''There is a fragile peace in Ireland at this moment and

He said regular meetings were taking place between the four Churches
in Ireland, and the ceasefire had been seen as ''an answer to prayer''.
In conclusion, Dr McGaughey said: ''Thank you for listening to us and
please continue to pray for us.''
* The Church of Scotland's minister in Jerusalem, the Rev Colin
Morton, yesterday warned of an impending crisis in the Middle East. The
former Prestonpans minister and Lothian Regional Councillor said:
''There is despair. There are the seeds of violence and despair,
well-watered and fertilised.''

A REVIEW of the boundaries of Scotland's eight European Parliament
constituencies was announced by Scottish Secretary Ian Lang last night.
He said in a Commons written reply that the Boundary Commission would
begin the task next week but he was unable to say how long it was likely
to take.
The last review of Euro-seats in Scotland took place in 1983.The move
follows changes this year to the boundaries of Commons constituencies,
which are used as the basis for the Euro-seat boundaries.

Secretary Malcolm Rikind over fears of heavy redundancies at the royal
naval dockyards at Rosyth and Devonport and a refusal by the MoD to give
assurances on redundancy pay and pension entitlements. About a further
2000 jobs are likely to be cut if the Government goes ahead with plans
to sell off the two dockyards, according to Transport and General
Workers' Union national secretary Jack Dromey. He was speaking at
Westminister yesterday during the latest lobby of Parliament aimed at
saving the yards, the two workforces, and their pension and redundancy
entitlements in the event of the sale proceeding.

IN a debate on economic and industrial interests, the Assembly called
on the Government to ''reduce the pressure on individuals to accept
humiliating levels of pay''.
To this it added words by Mr W J Thomas, a Dunbar elder, to ask the
Government to ''discourage the granting of unacceptably low levels of
pay and unacceptably high levels of pay and fringe benefits''.
The Assembly expressed concern at ''the increasingly short-term,
poorly paid, and insecure nature of employment'' and reaffirmed the
''desirability of secure and satisfying jobs''.
It accepted a motion to call on the Government to introduce
legislation to protect the wages of the low paid.
The Assembly rejected a call to support wealth creation.
Mr Paul Walker, an elder from Canonbie and assistant director of the
CBI in Scotland, moved that the Assembly recognise that wealth creation
was the provider of economic prosperity and the enabler of worthy social
problems.
His motion sought explicit support of the re-creation in Scotland of a
culture of enterprise, industry, and individual initiative.
Mr Walker said he was not arguing for unwarranted high pay,
competition, or market mania, but Scotland needed to translate its
skills into saleable products which would generate wealth.
The Rev Andrew McLellan, convener of the Church and Nation Committee,
opposing the motion, said the impression the business community had was
that the church was against wealth creation but this was slightly
unfair.
Capital investment, enterprise, and initiative were essential but
wealth creation was not by itself a good thing without asking how wealth
was created and shared.
Mr Walker's motion was clearly defeated.

AN appeal move on behalf of a convicted murderer sentenced to life in
prison 18 years ago looks likely to fail today.
Lawyers acting on behalf of Andrew Smith have been told by the
Justiciary Clerk to the High Court in Edinburgh that papers have been
found showing he has already had an appeal.
The new appeal was due to be heard by a bench headed by the Lord
Justice General, Lord Hope.
An official yesterday said that there had been a simple oversight. A
footnote, indicating that an appeal had already been heard, was spotted
by Lord Hope and a search of the archives had indicated that Smith had
previously fallen at the first hurdle, appearing on his own behalf
before the late Lord Wheatley, Lord Pearson, and Lord Thomson only to be
refused leave to proceed.
The official said: ''It is not a matter for recrimination, more
explanation . . . but it looks like Mr Smith will have to go to the
Secretary of State for Scotland.''
The Secretary of State can order a case to be reopened, even if it is
time-barred, by referring it back to court.
A jury in Glasgow convicted Smith, then 18, of murdering a man in a
Larkhall bar by punching him and knocking him to the floor. He served
six years of his sentence, but has been subject to life licence recall,
mainly for drink-related misbehaviour.
Smith, currently held at Noranside Prison, Angus, said yesterday: ''It
is yet another disappointment but I have overcome many disappointments
in the past. I have no memory of any appeal, but then I was 18 and had
just been given a life sentence and did not really know what was going
on.
''I will keep on fighting to get my appeal heard.''
Mr Angus McLellan, of the Dundee law firm Bruce Short which acts for
Smith, said yesterday: ''We researched this before launching the motion
for leave to appeal, which is on the basis of new evidence.
''We remain convinced that this case must get back into court and must
be heard.''
The new evidence involves an analysis of the victim's injuries by Mr
Derrick Pounder, professor of forensic medicine at Dundee University.

POLICE have arrested 20 people and seized guns, #1m worth of stolen
share certificates, and counterfeit currency in an operation against an
organised crime network, Scotland Yard said yesterday.
Detectives involved in Operation Dodger also recovered ammunition and
stolen cars in a series of raids in London, Luton, and Birmingham.
Among 10 weapons recovered were a high-calibre rifle, a machine
pistol, and an outlawed self-defence ''gas'' gun.
The counterfeit currency included #15,000 worth of what is known as
''wash dollars'' -- dollar bills bleached to make them look like $100
bills.
Officers from Scotland Yard's organised crime squad displayed the haul
at a news conference in London.
The raids, carried out in conjunction with West Midlands and
Bedfordshire Police, followed an eight-month investigation.
The 20 people held were being questioned last night.

Political Correspondent Stuart Trotter describes the sombre mood at
Westminster as both Houses paid tribute to Lord Wilson
IN THE course of nature, Parliament, from time to time, finds itself
paying tributes to a former Prime Minister who has just passed
away.Quite correctly, Members embrace Dr Johnson's sensible observation
that ''in lapidary inscriptions, a man is not upon oath.''
They recall the good and avoid what was controversial in the career in
question. So it was yesterday. The business of both Houses was billed as
''tributes to Lord Wilson of Rievaulx,'' not critical analysis of his
political record.
One biography of Wilson was subtitled ''Yorkshire Walter Mitty'' -- a
reference to Wilson's habit in his volumes of memoirs of rewriting the
history of his administrations so that disasters appeared as triumphs,
with the Premier always coolly in charge of events.
The payers of tributes abstained from delivering as fulsome
compliments to his governance of Britain as he did himself, but avoided
recalling the futile and damaging defence of the pound in 1966; the
inability to reform the trade unions; the weakness that allowed the
Northern Ireland executive to be overthrown; and the savage cuts in
services valued by his party and the nation.
Only a couple of references recalled his almost constant paranoia
about Cabinet plots against him.
However, as Mr Tony Benn observed with a quizzical glance at John
Major, ''That's not uncommon.''
From time to time, speakers' situations seemed to parallel that of the
man they were praising.
Mr Major, who could hardly have been more generous, applauded almost
wistfully Wilson's ''ability to conciliate, often a scorned attribute''.
Mr Blair spoke of Wilson's election in 1964 seeming to usher in a new
age of hope which he might pardonably wish that 30 years or so on a
Blair election might also seem to do.
Lord Wilson's pipe came in for a good deal of notice -- ''an effective
brand image for his party'' said Lord Cecil, Leader of the Lords.
His raincoat, at one time almost as famous, seemed to rate only one
mention, and Paddy the golden labrador who was Britain's first dog for a
time, none -- perhaps a punishment for nearly drowning his owner by
capsizing a boat they were sharing.
The wit, the prodigious memory, the hard grafted transformation of
himself from dull parliamentary and media performer to star, were all
recalled.
Current events intervened occasionally. Jim Molyneaux, of the Ulster
Unionists, dismissed the idea that Wilson's only political principle was
keeping his party together.
Nothing disreputable about that, he added dryly. ''Though some of us
are more successful than others.'' Everyone seemed to look at the Prime
Minister.
Lord Marsh, a former Labour Cabinet Minister who was sacked by Wilson,
converted to Conservatism and now sits on the cross benches, observed
that to call Wilson a fixer was to underestimate him. ''He was a prince
among political fixers,'' he said, recalling from his inside seat that
Wilson had to contend with a Cabinet ''whose admiration and affection
for him was somewhat muted.''
Sir Edward Heath was generous about a Wilson ability which has
certainly eluded him to chat up all sorts and conditions of men.
Mr Gerald Kaufman revived memories of Wilson as HP Sauce's greatest
unpaid promoter, who could not understand Roy Jenkins's taste for
repasts more sophisticated than steak and chips covered with about
half-a-bottle of the stuff.
Roy suggested to the peers that Wilson's resignation, long cloaked in
mystery, may actually have followed the first signs to him that his
powers were waning. ''If so it was a noble decision''.
Every speech mentioned Wilson's personal kindness which is well
documented.
Lord Jenkins said that he never liked being unpleasant to anyone, not
always the case with people who shared his thirst for power.
On those qualities of good humour and kindness many people were
prepared to go on oath. and that is a good epitaph for anyone.

THE Kirk's General Assembly is often likened to the nearest thing to a
Scottish Parliament we have had for 300 years. In this scenario, the
Moderator is the Prime Minister (primus inter pares), the committees of
the Kirk are the Government, and the conveners of these committees are
the Cabinet Ministers.
This analogy can easily be disputed, but of all the days of business
Church and Nation Day comes closest to acting out the
quasi-parliamentary scenario. However, on this occasion the Prime
Minister and mover is not the Moderator but the convener of the Church
and Nation Committee.
He stands at the rostrum (dispatch box) and is expected by tradition
to make a keynote speech, field all kinds of detailed questions on a
wide-ranging report, defend his corner, and decide which amendments to
accept and which to reject. The convener, at the end of a gruelling day
in a fetid hall lacking in oxygen, usually pours himself a stiff drink.
Andrew McLellan is a teetotaller and denies himself that privilege but
yesterday he certainly earned it. Arguably one of the most able Church
and Nation conveners in the past generation (making him above the par of
several ex-Moderators) his success, in my view, has a lot to do with his
ability to combine in one persona so many of the facets within the Kirk.
Despite having crossed the to wrong side of 50, he is boyish and
bouncy, with an eager grin. He comes over as the fresh-faced alternative
to tired and crusty ministers. He talks the vocabulary of born-again
evangelicals, looking bright eyed and sincere as he does so, but at the
same time can claim the allegiance of the Kirk's establishment, among
whom he mixes easily and has many friends.
Politically he is a fellow traveller of the left, an ex-Liberal town
councillor with friends among the Iona Community, and he is the darling
of broadcasters who he goes out of his way to accommodate. McLellan's
predecessor could rouse the ire of his opponents with a style that
relied less on consensus. Ironically, he was an ex-civil servant and
less of a preacher/teacher than McLellan.
This man of many jobs also holds down a city centre church with a
demanding congregation. Part of his success is also that he combines a
sense of humour with a steely resolve and a keen intellect. He can smile
and say no without appearing to be hurtful, manipulate without appearing
to be interested in power. Yet throughout this appearance of being all
things to all people, his consistency remains undented and even his
opponents would not accuse him of being two-faced.
Yesterday his message was that the Church must dance to a different
tune from that of society as a whole. This Lord of the Dance led the
Assembly through a minefield of deliverances without treading on any
(literally as well as metaphorically, since self-destructing landmines
were one part of the arms trade of which his committee had disapproved).
It will be highly unlikely if he will self-destruct on his way to the
Moderatorial chair.
Despite the talents of the convener and the less contentious tone of
the report, Church and Nation day has never been so poorly attended in
recent years. Usually the public galleries are packed, the balcony
studded with VIPs, and the commissioners' benches full. Yesterday there
were only a few weel kent faces in the balcony and plenty of room on the
benches. Several other conveners I know had paid Church and Nation the
ultimate insult of playing golf instead of listening to the debate. As
for the Commissioners, they seemed more excited about worship the day
before than the setpiece of Church and Nation.
Is this a backlash against a previously high profile? A few years ago
the Church and Nation committee was being accused by the Government of
politicising the Church. As they ponder their lukewarm reception this
week, the committee may wonder whether it is preferable to be attacked
than to be ignored.

ROBBIE DINWOODIE reports on the last day of the Perth and Kinross
campaign
VOTERS go to the polls today in Perth and Kinross, with the only doubt
surrounding who will come second in the by-election behind a runaway SNP
bandwagon.
It is likely that Nationalist candidate Roseanna Cunningham will
garner more than double the number of votes of her nearest challenger --
a mantle claimed yesterday by each of the three main rival parties.
The runner-up will probably be New Labour standard-bearer Douglas
Alexander, but he looked unaccustomedly isolated yesterday, with only
the party's Scottish general secretary Jack McConnell by his side, in
contrast to the parade of Shadow Cabinet figures who have flanked him
during the last three weeks.
It looked very much to the press as if the leadership had deserted as
a loser a candidate they had built up as a certain winner.
Mr McConnell denied this, saying the top team had to be at Westminster
yesterday, although this did not stop SNP leader Alex Salmond or Mr
Archy Kirkwood, of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, being at the side of
their candidates, while Employment Secretary Michael Portillo was in
Perth to support Tory candidate John Godfrey.
Mr McConnell insisted that Labour doubling its share of the poll would
be a real achievement, and, in a tribute to Lord Wilson, he drew a
direct parallel with another young Labour leader who modernised his
party and went on to become Prime Minister.
However, the worry for Labour was that while it was claiming Tory
defections straight across to it, there was poll evidence of significant
numbers of its own supporters slipping across to the SNP. This would
damage its prospects of making the inroads required to support its
argument that there were no longer ''no-go areas'' in Scotland for
Labour.
If the polls have underestimated Tory support and Labour followers are
disheartened by the surge that never was, then it becomes harder to
predict second place with certainty.
If Tory support really is in meltdown, however, and if the polls have
failed to pick up the Liberal Democrats' highly focused targeting
strategy in the landward areas, fourth place is not impossible for the
party defending the seat held by the late Sir Nicholas Fairbairn with a
majority of just over 2000 votes.
Mr Portillo said yesterday that Mr Godfrey had been a ''absolutely
superb candidate'' who had run a hard-hitting campaign, and he insisted
that constitutional change posed a threat to jobs in Scotland.
Mr Godfrey made a final appeal to voters to think carefully before
casting a vote for the ''cul-de-sac'' of separatism and to reject
''narrow-minded nationalism.''
Liberal Democrat candidate Veronica Linklater claimed the Tory vote
was crumbling and their style of campaign had won them few friends. She
completed her hustings with a final impassioned plea: ''I urge people to
vote according to their consciences and their principles and for the
issues that they really believe in.''
SNP leader Alex Salmond called the Tories' campaign the most
disreputable he had come across and said New Labour had aped much of the
same language.
Ms Cunningham said that the SNP had put forward a positive agenda. She
said: ''Our campaign has worked because it has engaged people's hopes
for Scotland's future, while our opponents have shamelessly and
unsuccessfully tried to generate fears and smears.''
Five other candidates are contesting the seat. They are:
Gary Black, Natural Law Party; Michael Halford, Scottish Conservatory
and Unionist; Robin Harper, Scottish Green Party; Vivian Linacre, UK
Independence Party; and Lord David Sutch, Official Monster Munch Raving
Loony Party.

FRESH accusations that the Government is moving towards full-scale
privatisation of the health service were made at Scottish Question Time
in the Commons yesterday.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson raised new concerns over
the plans by Grampian Health Board to invite open competition for the
provision of hospital services in Stonehaven, while a row also broke out
over nurses' pay.
Before questions began, Mr Robertson released a letter to him from
Scottish Secretary Ian Lang which, Mr Robertson claimed, disclosed ''an
unprecedented step towards the privatisation of NHS hospitals.''
The letter said it was important that Grampian Health Board explored
all funding options (for Stonehaven) and that it was, therefore, drawing
up specifications stipulating the quality standards and service outputs
it expected to be delivered as a basis for competitive bids.
''I would expect the board to give all the bids received full and fair
consideration and to be rigorous in ensuring that the preferred provider
is capable of delivering the service specification to the highest
standards,'' Mr Lang said. ''It will be for the board to select which
option, in its opinion, best addresses the service criteria and the
needs of the people of Stonehaven.''
Mr Robertson said: ''Ian Lang has effectively given carte blanche to
Grampian Health Board to contract out NHS services to the private
sector. Despite repeated questioning by Labour on this subject, he still
has not given the people of Stonehaven any indication as to which
services he would not be prepared to see contracted out to the private
sector.
''This letter confirms our worst suspicions that, as far as the
Scottish Office is concerned, anything goes, and this is the thin end of
the wedge for Scotland's health service. Unless it is stopped, what is
happening in Stonehaven will happen elsewhere.''
In the House, Mr Robertsonsaid the Prime Minister had said in 1991
that there should be no privatisation of the health service either
piecemeal or as a whole.
''There is now no doubt whatsoever that it is the contrast between the
words and the reality on privatisation that has led the Scottish party
into electoral free-fall.''
Scottish Office Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton told him: ''If
you feel like that, why did you say in January that Labour was not
opposed to public-private partnerships, which is precisely what we are
talking about. The great advantage of bringing in private funds is to
make public services go much further.''
On nurses' pay, Lord James held firmly to the Government line that
there could be no return to national pay bargaining.
Mr George Foulkes (Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley -- Lab.) who
received a written answer on the matter on Tuesday, said the
Government's claim that nurses in Scotland would be getting 3% was
''entirely bogus.''
He added: ''The truth is total chaos and disarray, with only eight of
the 47 trusts offering 3% without strings. Others are seeking to reduce
the conditions of service by removing statutory holidays or changing the
conditions of service.''
Mr Foulkes demanded a return to collective bargaining on a national
basis to give all nurses the pay increase they richly deserved. Lord
James replied: ''The answer is no. The great advantage of local
negotiations is that local pay can be a great advantage in making local
services more responsive to local needs.
''It does not mean less pay, it means fair pay taking local services
into account.''

AN NHS trust which made a #3.5m surplus last year has swung this year
into a #8.3m deficit.
Grampian Healthcare was one of the examples used by Labour MP Alan
Milburn to illustrate what he claimed was a ''national lottery'' where
staff pay and treatment depend on the financial standing of individual
hospitals.
Quoting last year's accounts, Mr Milburn showed how the performance of
trusts could vary between one extreme -- East Gloucestershire's surplus
of #6,459,000 -- and another -- North West Thames's deficit of #5.1m.
Mr Milburn said: ''The NHS has become a national lottery -- producing
losers as well as winners. Without changes to the health market, the
treatment of patients and the pay of staff will become increasingly
dependent upon the financial standing of individual hospitals.
''Funding for health care is being decided by commercial rather than
clinical considerations. The health service cannot be run like a series
of competing firms without doing untold damage to patient care.''
However, the Scottish Office released unaudited figures for this year
showing that only two trusts in Scotland were in deficit -- Grampian
Healthcare and the Victoria Infirmary in Glasgow, with a deficit of
#4.3m. Both trusts attributed these to major property value write-offs
which did not affect the financial viability of the trusts in any way.
''Since last year, we have closed down Kingseat and House of Daviot
hospitals, and they have still to be sold, so that is taken off our
asset value,'' said a Grampian spokesman. ''It just shows how
nonsensical it is to bandy these figures about.''
The Victoria's deficit arises from the closure of the Samaritan
Hospital. Chief Executive Barrie Small said: ''Once that is taken into
account, we will have a net trading surplus of #427,000.
The total gross surplus generated by the 39 trusts in existence before
April 1 was #31.9m, with the biggest surplus, #3.1m, generated by
Edinburgh Royal Infirmary.
A Scottish Health Department spokesman said: ''It is quite erroneous
to refer to these as profits. After the trusts have made a return on
their debt burden, they simply put the surplus into their capital
spending account.''

SCOTTISH Secretary Ian Lang last night promised a cheaper and better
rail service for Scotland after privatisation.
As MPs raised concerns about rail services between Scotland and
England, he pledged that any cuts or restrictions on rail fares would
apply throughout the United Kingdom and made clear his view that
privatisation was the best way forward.
The rail issue was raised at Scottish Question Time by the Liberal
Democrats' Transport spokesman Paul Tyler -- MP for Cornwall North --
who is leading a campaign to save the sleeper service between the West
Country and Scotland, due to cease this weekend.
He said that if the Secretary of State was taking such an interest,
why did he not address the problem of a service which carried 32,000
people a year and was of huge importance to the tourist industry at both
ends of the country?
Mr Lang pointed out that there was a subsidy of #44 per passenger on
the route, which worked out at #1.4m a year for a sleeper which was
''roughly half occupied.''
The Scottish Secretary said he had been taking ''a close interest'' in
the future of the railways. He and the Transport Secretary agreed that
the Scottish economy would continue to derive substantial benefit from
the continuation of sleeper services to and from Scotland and that such
services remained important.
Labour MP Sam Galbraith (Strathkelvin and Bearsden) said: ''You may be
taking a close interest in these matters but you are not doing very much
about them.'' He demanded: ''When will you stop lying down in front of
the privatisation express?'' Mr Calum MacDonald (Western Isles -- Lab.)
argued that all parts of Scotland had to be on an equal basis in terms
of transport links with the rest of the country, and if Mr Lang did not
accept that then he did not care about the social and economic future of
the Highlands.
From the Labour Front Bench, Mr John McFall said that if the Prime
Minister was serious about listening to the people of Scotland the
Government would abandon this ''folly'' of privatisation immediately.

HIGHLANDS and Islands Enterprise is commissioning a #30,000 study to
build an economic case for retaining and advancing Highland rail
services.
This was announced yesterday just eight days before the British
Railways Board is due to appeal against Lord Kirkwood's reprieve for the
Fort William sleeper pending public consultation. British Rail has also
announced cuts in the services to Oban, Fort William, Kyle, Wick and
Thurso.
A ScotRail spokesman said last night ''We would certainly try and
co-operate with such a study, where possible, but we would not be able
to release information which was commercially confidential.''

THE self-styled leader of the Scottish National Liberation Army, Mr
Adam Busby, was yesterday released without charge along with two other
men after being questioned in Dublin about activities linked to the
outlawed terror group.
An Irish police spokesman said a report was being prepared for the
Director of Public Prosecutions.
The men were arrested by Special Branch detectives in Dublin on Monday
in connection with possible explosives offences. They were held under
anti-terrorist legislation which allows people to be kept in custody for
48 hours without charge.
The spokesman dismissed a suggestion that Mr Busby, 47, from Old
Kilpatrick, near Glasgow, had been held in conection with the
forthcoming visit to Dublin by Prince Charles.
Mr Busby left Scotland 12 years ago. He has been living in Dublin
since allegedly breaching bail in Scotland after being charged with
damaging a military vehicle.
The SNLA, which wants independence for Scotland, has been blamed for a
string of letter bombs and hoaxes over the years.
It gained notoriety in the 1980s with a wave of letter bombs sent to
prominent figures, including the then Prime Minister, Mrs Margaret
Thatcher. All were intercepted or defused without causing injury.
In March this year the SNLA claimed to have sent out six letter bombs
timed to coincide with Labour's Scottish conference in Inverness.
One was addressed to the Shadow Scottish Secretary, Mr George
Robertson, and another went to Labour leader Tony Blair's home in
Durham. None went off.
It is believed Strathclyde Police launched a move last month to start
extradition proceedings to bring Mr Busby back from Dublin.
Grampian Police also has an outstanding warrant for his arrest.

THE controversial Free Church of Scotland minister, the Rev Professor
Donald MacLeod, last night warned that his church would face ''serious
haemorrhaging'' if its General Assembly failed to lay to rest today
long-running allegations against him.
Professor MacLeod, speaking publicly for the first time since Lothian
and Borders Police confirmed it was investigating a complaint against
him, said that if the Assembly session, which he said he would not be
attending, did not clear him, he would feel emotionally he had reached
the point of no return.
''If that happens it's the worst scenario, and it would mean another
two years of turmoil because of the speed of church administration,''
said Professor MacLeod, who stated that it would be difficult to stay
part of a body ''putting procedures before person and before justice''.
Professor MacLeod, who has held the chair of systematic theology at
the Free Church College in Edinburgh since 1978, said he would have to
think very carefully about the future direction of his career.
He said he would need to explore options if it went against him. ''I
might not be a minister at all. I might go somewhere else. Obviously it
affects others besides myself, and I know that if the Assembly goes
against us, many people will give consideration to their own futures.''
The church, he said, could face serious haemorrhaging, although he
would not be encouraging people to leave. However, it could prove
''fatal'' in the light of its financial situation, he warned.
The professor, who would not comment on the police investigation
affecting his personal life, has rejected calls from supporters to be
present at the private session debating a report from the church's
Training for Ministry Committee.
Last October, it dismissed allegations against Professor MacLeod, who
claims he has been the victim of a ''smear'' campaign.
Committee members have cleared the professor three times in nine
years, and his supporters claim the revival of allegations is due to a
body of church members opposed to his views.
Professor MacLeod would be able to address this afternoon's private
session, in Edinburgh, as a member of this year's Assembly, but last
night made it clear he would not be attending.
''I will not be near the place and I will leave it to the brethren. I
had been asked to go and speak, but I don't see any point in being in
the middle of such interchanges. I don't see any need to sit through it.
I don't have anything to defend myself against.''
He said there were those who wanted the issue referred for a
continuation of the investigation by the church.
''I made the decision last year that I would not be a party to any
formal discussions of these issues.''
The professor, who claimed he was ''content and fairly optimistic'',
said the matter should be ''a closed book'', and not re-opened.
''It's an important point in my life. There has been a lot of goodwill
towards me.''
It is expected that lawyers acting on behalf of Profesor MacLeod will
monitor the debate. They will decide if there are grounds for a
defamation action if they consider that his reputation and integrity had
been brought into disrepute at the Assembly.
Meanhwile, the report being drawn up by Lothian and Borders Police, in
the wake of an investigation into a complaint against the professor, is
now not expected to be submitted to the procurator-fiscal for another
week.
It had been anticipated that the report would reach the fiscal's
office in Edinburgh this week, but authorities there have now ruled that
out.

THE sheriff who holds the fate of #4m Everton and Scotland striker
Duncan Ferguson in his hands will be asked today to look at two videos
of football field violence.
The videos will form part of Ferguson's plea in mitigation that
players who have committed worse violence on the field than the former
Rangers player have been dealt with by football's own disciplinary code
rather than the criminal courts.
Ferguson, who came on as a substitute for Everton in last Saturday's
FA cup final, is due to be sentenced by Glasgow Sheriff Alexander Eccles
after being found guilty of assaulting former Raith Rovers defender John
McStay.
Ferguson claimed that the clash was accidental but the sheriff decided
that he had head-butted Mr McStay deliberately during a league match at
Ibrox.
In view of Ferguson's three previous convictions for assault, the
sheriff deferred sentence until today for background reports.
Yesterday at the High Court in Edinburgh, Ferguson's counsel, Mr
Donald Findlay QC, told Lord Ross, the Lord Justice Clerk, that he was
seeking recovery of two videos in the hands of Scottish Television.
The videos feature the Scottish Junior Cup Final last May between
Largs Thistle and Glenafton Athletic in which two players from each side
were sent off, and a pre-season friendly between Hearts and Raith Rovers
when Hearts defenders Craig Levein and Graeme Hogg became involved in a
punch-up.

A SOLICITOR has lost his unfair dismissal claim against Glasgow law
firm Anderson Fyfe.
Mr Colin Forbes, of Netherlee, Glasgow, took Anderson Fyfe Solicitors,
of St Vincent Street, to an industrial tribunal after his job was axed.
The Glasgow tribunal heard he was made redundant after two years with
the firm as an assistant solicitor.
Mr Forbes denied his post was redundant.
The tribunal heard that by April last year Mr Forbes should have been
considered for an associateship but he was subsequently told his future
lay elsewhere and he started looking for alternative employment.
The tribunal heard Mr Forbes had met his performance targets but was
less than efficient in certain of his administrative duties. He had not
received any warning about his performance, legal or administrative.
Around the same time the firm's litigation business was contracting
and it was decided there should be a redundancy. Mr Forbes workload was
largely unaffected by the downturn but a score sheet was drawn up based
on qualifications, experience, and ability to do certain types of work.
Mr Forbes finished bottom.
When told he was being considered for redundancy, Mr Forbes contended
he wasn't redundant -- he had a heavy case load and a significant amount
of work about to come to court.
Mr Forbes, who got another job in Aberdeen, wanted the tribunal to
order his reinstatement but the firm said it would not be practicable.
They had not taken on a replacement and there had been no upturn in the
workload.
In its findings the tribunal said it was satisfied that the partners
genuinely believed they were dismissing Mr Forbes on the grounds of
redundancy. There was no question of him being sacked on a pretext
because he had not come up to the mark.

VALUABLE computer components are being kept in a safe suspended 40ft
above the factory floor at Digital's plant in Ayr and an
around-the-clock guard has been mounted after a spate of thefts.
Ayr Sheriff Court heard yesterday that the extreme measures had been
introduced after thousands of pounds worth of equipment was stolen
between last April and May.
Craig Miller, 25, of Tower Drive, Gourock, was jailed for two years
yesterday for his part in the thefts. Miller persuaded two of his
colleagues at Digital's Ayr computer plant to smuggle out #20,000 worth
of computer parts in their clothing, the court heard.
He then sold them on to an underworld contact in Greenock. Miller,
Jack Irving, and Steven Docherty, were working on the nightshift when
they hatched their scheme.
A robbery at a computer factory in Greenock had been given widespread
media coverage. When they read how much the equipment they worked with
could fetch on the black market, they decided to help themselves. The
court heard that Miller had become enmeshed in a criminal network in
Greenock.
and he lived in fear of retribution from his former masters.
Miller admitted stealing 80 Intel microprocessors between April 1 and
May 9 last year. He also admitted stealing 500 Flash microchips. Depute
Fiscal Alison Wyllie said the microprocessors were worth #19,000 and the
microchips #3728.
When police raided Miller's girlfriend's flat they found #1000. They
also found some of the microchips hidden in his car. The car and the
#1000 were forfeited by the court.
Jailing Miller for two years Sheriff Robin McEwan told him: ''You were
involved in a scheme which was carefully planned and executed at
considerable profit.''
Docherty, of Irvine, had earlier been jailed for 18 months and Irving,
of Ayr, for 15 months.
Miller's solicitor told the court earlier that new security measures
at Digital included the suspended safe and the 24-hour guard.

FRANCIS AULD, the man tried for the murder of 19-year-old Hamilton
student Amanda Duffy -- a charge found not proven by a jury -- has
decided not to defend a #50,000 civil action brought against him by her
parents.
Mr Peter Anderson, the Edinburgh lawyer acting for the Duffys, said
yesterday: ''I am sure they will regard this as the equivalent of an
admission of responsibility on Mr Auld's part, although no doubt he will
see it differently.''
But last night, speaking at their home in Hamilton, the Duffys seemed
taken aback by the news and reluctant to speculate about its
implication. Clearly upset, Mrs Kate Duffy said she and her husband had
not had an opportunity to discuss Mr Auld's decision with their lawyer
but added that she was ''gutted''.
Mr Auld's decision was announced yesterday in a statement issued by
Brodies, the Edinburgh solicitors acting on his behalf.
In the statement Mr Auld, who is now understood to be living in
England, maintained his innocence.
He said: ''I was tried for a crime I did not commit and I was fairly
acquitted by a jury of 15 people. My family and I have been through
enough and I have no wish to become involve in a personal matter with
anyone.''
Brodies said: ''Mr Francis Auld has advised us that it is not his
intention to become involved in the civil action which Mr and Mrs Duffy
have raised against him.
''In accordance with those instructions we are taking no further steps
in the proceedings. It will now be for Mr and Mrs Duffy to decide what
further action they intend to take.''
Mr Duffy said last night he and his wife intended to go away for a few
days on business. He said the couple had not had an opportunity to talk
to their solicitor during the day and added that he was reluctant to
make any detailed comments until they had done so.
He said: ''Because of the legal implications I'm not prepared to say
anything and get it wrong. I don't want to stick my neck out until I've
spoken to our solicitor.''
Mrs Duffy said: ''I'm gutted. It has already cost a lot of money.
There's nothing else I can say until I've spoken to the solicitor.''
Earlier the couple's daughter, Angela, said as far as she understood a
decision not to contest the case was ''an admission of guilt on Mr
Auld's part''. She said her parents had wanted to go to court.
Mr Anderson said in Edinburgh that Kate and Joe Duffy would now need
time to consider what their next steps would be.
If they wish they can go to the Court of Session to ask a judge to
grant a decree for #50,000 against Mr Auld in his absence then take
steps to enforce it.
But the Duffys have made it clear all along that they are not seeking
cash, but rather redress for what they see as the injustice of Mr Auld's
acquittal and a judicial declaration that he was responsible for their
daughter's death.
Following a court decree they could arrest any bank accounts Mr Auld
has in Scotland and get an inhibition against any Scottish property he
owns, but this is likely to be an academic issue.
Lawyers who spoke to The Herald yesterday were not surprised by Mr
Auld's decision not to contest the case. Most said that was exactly the
advice they would have given had they been acting for him.
The advantages of defending the action would have been that if he had
won he could have presented the case as a further clearing of his
reputation. It would also have been a way of protecting #50,000,
assuming he had that sort of sum to protect.
By not defending he has denied the Duffys the opportunity of another
public airing of the allegations against him which a highly publicised
court hearing would have provided.
In another case at the Court of Session, the widow and children of
Greenock taxi driver Raymond Mullan have also raised an action following
the decision of a High Court jury to acquit the man charged with his
murder.
Mrs Margaret Mullan and her three children are claiming #100,000 from
Mr David Anderson, of Nelson road, Gourock, who was charged with
stabbing Mr Mullan through the heart during a taxi journey from Gourock
to Greenock in February 1990.
As in Mr Auld's case, the jury returned a not proven verdict against
Mr Anderson.
A legal debate in the Mullan case is expected soon and the Court of
Session will have to make a policy decision as to whether actions for
damages of the Duffy and Mullan type should be allowed following an
acquittal by a jury in criminal proceedings.

SOCCER star Paul Ince was relaxing with his family last night and
looking forward to resuming his England career after being acquitted of
threatening Crystal Palace fans and attacking one of them.
The 27-year-old Manchester United midfielder, whose international
football career was thrown into doubt, smiled broadly and heaved a huge
sigh of relief as magistrates at Croydon, south London, announced their
not guilty verdicts.
Immediately after the hearing the Football Association confirmed that
the player was back in favour.
Ince was picked by England coach Terry Venables on Tuesday for the
squad for the forthcoming Umbro Cup matches, having been omitted from
the friendly with Uruguay in March.
An FA spokeswoman said: ''We're very pleased the matter has been
resolved.''
United's assistant secretary, Mr Ken Ramsden, said: ''Our reaction is
one of delight and relief.''
Magistrates took minutes to clear the player of one charge of
''assault by beating'' and another alleging threatening behaviour in the
wake of team mate Eric Cantona's ''notorious'' Kung Fu-style attack on a
Palace fan at Selhurst Park on January 25.

A MAN was cleared of attempting to gouge the eye of a Western
performer, but found guilty of assault and breach of the peace, at the
High Court in Edinburgh yesterday.
John McMillan, 27, known as Desperate Dan in Western circles, was
cleared of attempting to gouge out the eye of Mr William MacGregor,
known as Wishbone, and attacking his former wife Miss Lorraine Parker,
also known as Hellcat.
After an hour's consideration a jury acquitted him of the most serious
charges he faced after a Country and Western night at an Edinburgh bar
ended up in a showdown.
The jury cleared him of charges of attacking Mr MacGregor, 41, to his
severe injury, permanent disfigurement and permanent impairment of
vision.
But he was found guilty of a reduced charge of assaulting the East of
Scotland fast draw champion by fighting with him at the Clermiston Inn
on March 13, 1993.
The jury also acquitted him of assaulting Miss Parker, 32, to her
permanent disfigurement by forcing his finger inside her nose, but found
him guilty of a breach of the peace at the bar.
McMillan's defence counsel, Mr Robert Anthony, said the offences were
''out of character'' for his unemployed client.
Judge Lord Johnston told McMillan, of Wester Hailes Park, Edinburgh,
that he was prepared to give him a chance by deferring sentence on him
for a year.
But the judge warned that the threat of a jail sentence would be left
hanging over him if he got into further trouble.

SAFEWAY is to cut 4800 jobs throughout Britain but create 7500 new
ones as part of a restructuring plan, it announced yesterday.
The move follows an efficiency review aimed at keeping up with market
leaders Tesco and Sainsbury.
Safeway will open 34 new stores over the next two years, creating the
7500 jobs, and will increase spending on marketing and customer services
by #25m.
But the parent company, Argyll, has also announced job losses because
of the closure of a number of Safeway and Presto stores, mainly
affecting managers and supervisers.
Around 1800 jobs will go because of store closures and another 3000
will be axed over the next few months through efficiency programmes.
The job losses will include about 1400 at 20 of the company's older
and smaller Safeway stores which have been closed or are due to close --
one of which is in Hamilton -- and 400 at 27 Presto stores the company
said it would close two weeks ago. A total of 18 Presto stores in
Scotland are among those to be closed, with the loss of 250 jobs.
Safeway has a district office and distribution centre at Bellshill in
Lanarkshire and district offices in Edinburgh, Saltcoats, and Paisley.
Argyll chief executive Colin Smith said yesterday that he hoped to
redeploy some staff. Voluntary redundancy and early retirement will be
on offer, but he could not rule out compulsory job losses. The
redundancies will cost Argyll around #50m.
Safeway's sales were up 5% in the first seven weeks of the year and Mr
Smith said.
The company's Safeway 2000 review will be completed by the summer, two
years after it began, Mr Smith added.
Two of the new Safeway stores due to be opened this year are in
Scotland, at Airdrie, and Baillieston in Glasgow.

THE chairman of Rolls-Royce yesterday told shareholders that employees
at the company's doomed East Kilbride plant in particular, and the
British people in general, would have to learn to move to where their
jobs took them.
Sir Ralph Robbins, accused of displaying blatant arrogance, also
defended the board's decision to shut the company's ''remote''
engineering and support plant in Lanarkshire and the plan to switch the
work to Derby on sound commercial grounds and by adopting the infamous
''On Yer Bike'' solution first put forward by Lord Tebbit.
However, pressure from a lobby of East Kilbride workers at the
Rolls-Royce annual meeting in London forced the company into opening a
fresh dialogue with the unions over the planned closure.
The gap between management and unions remains wide, but serious talks
over the proposed loss of 600 jobs are now expected to resume before the
weekend.
The company, however, still insists the work will move south.
Workers in the US thought nothing of moving with the job, Sir Ralph
told shareholders.
He himself had been on the move constantly during his 40 years with
the company. In future as Rolls-Royce business became more and more
global, he would expect people to move to American and Australia, or
wherever. If they did not want to, then the company would find someone
else who would.
Those whose jobs were under threat in East Kilbride, he said, had been
offered alternative work at Derby and at another company plant.
Workers, would have to learn that in future they could not expect the
job to come to them, he declared.
His remarks infuriated Mr Owen Thomas, one of the leaders of the
campaign to save the jobs in East Kilbride.
It ill-befitted someone on a salary of half a million pounds to
lecture those on working class pay on moving home, he said to loud
applause from the large turnout of shareholders in the Queen Elizabeth
11 Conference Centre.
The rebuke in front of shareholders brought an immediate concession
from Sir Ralph.
The workers' representatives having failed over several weeks to
obtain a meeting with the board over the planned closure were suddenly
offered talks.
''The whole operation to come to London was hugely successful. We will
have to see where it now takes us,'' Mr Owen said.
In January the company announced the engineering work and customer
support work would cease at East Kilbride by the end of the year, but
had subsequently brought this date forward to June.
Exercising his right as a shareholder to question the chairman, Mr
Owen demanded to know how 40 years of work and expertise could be
switched from East Kilbride to Derby in four weeks.
Sir Ralph told shareholders that the move to Derby was inevitable.
Bringing all the engineering works into the one hall would not only
bring substantial savings it would vastly improve efficiency.
The company's main competitor in America had claimed to have cut its
engineering workforce in half to 5000, he said. In these circumstances,
Rolls-Royce could not continue to carry on engineering at a remote site
at East Kilbride.
For many of the shareholders it was the first time that they had heard
of the Scottish new town.
There was severe criticism that the board had awarded themselves wage
increases of around 27% while the workforce was restricted to pay rises
of only 2%.

<HEADLINE>Government fails to identify a favoured national scheme. Howard puts six ID-card options</HEADLINE>

THE Government backed away from imposing a compulsory national
identity card scheme yesterday by refusing to endorse any of the options
contained in its long-awaited green paper.
Home Secretary Michael Howard said ID cards would help the fight
against crime, but he chose to remain neutral over which system he and
the Government favour.
The six options in his green paper, which range from the status quo to
a fully compulsory scheme, will be put out to consultation. Mr Howard
insisted that both he and the Prime Minister believe there are distinct
advantages to ID cards.
However, the Government's hesitancy reflects internal splits over the
issue. Despite strong grassroots support among Tories, who see ID cards
as a way of identifying criminals, several Cabinet members are known to
be opposed to such a scheme on libertarian grounds.
Mr Howard dismissed reports of a Cabinet split. ''The Government as a
whole is committed to the approach set out in this document. No further
decision has been taken so there can hardly be any question of
disagreement.''
The compromise that is expected to come out of the debate is a
voluntary extension of the Government's plans to introduce photographs
on the driver's licence and an identity card for benefit claimants.
These two measures are expected to cover a majority of the population.
Labour said the green paper highlighted the divisions in the Tory
Party. The Shadow Home Secretary, Mr Jack Straw, said: ''The downgrading
of ID cards has left a gaping hole in the Government's strategy on law
and order.''
He added: ''We are opposed to the introduction of compulsory ID cards
which are alien to the British tradition of strong individual liberty.''
A voluntary scheme could be too expensive.
''There is a powerful case for improving the security of existing
documents such a driving licences, bank and credit cards, and social
security benefit books and cards. This would help tackle the growing
fraud problem in Britain,'' he said.
The Liberal Democrats condemned the introduction of any scheme. Home
affairs spokesman Simon Hughes said: ''Even if a voluntary scheme were
to be introduced, it would lead to demands for people to produce the
official card in an increasing number and variety of circumstances.''
Part of the pressure for ID cards comes from Europe, where national
identity cards are in extensive use and are an accepted cultural
feature. But Mr Howard sought to reassure Euro-sceptics in his party who
believe it may lead to abolishing frontier controls.
The options Mr Howard proposes are:
* The status quo, with no changes to current plans, leaving people to
rely on such documents as the new photo driving licences, birth
certificates, and passports to confirm their identity in the UK.
* A separate voluntary identity card to be used as a travel document
in Europe and an identity document in the UK.
* The use of the photocard driving licence as a de facto identity
card.
* A combined driving licence and identity card, with a separate
identity card available for non-drivers.
* A multi-function Government card which would also be used in place
of various existing documents.
* A compulsory ID card.

GREENPEACE failed yesterday to win an English court order preventing
Shell dumping the disused Brent Spar in the Atlantic when the judge
ruled that it would be ''improper'' for an English court to seek to
review a Scottish case.
Mr Justice Popplewell ruled in the High Court in London that it was
not in his jurisdiction to review ''the making of what is essentially a
foreign administrative decision''.
The judge accepted it would be more difficult for Greenpeace to launch
a similar challenge in the Scottish courts. But he said the group could
probably put forward its arguments through nominated individuals.
The environmental protest group defended its decision to use the
English court system to challenge the dumping of the disused oil loading
terminal -- despite the fact that previous legal action had taken place
in the Scottish courts.
The group denied its actions had been a ''slap in the face'' for the
Scottish legal system.
Greenpeace's legal director, Ms Sarah Burton, said it would be an
''extraordinary person who would stand up against Shell and the
Government''.
Lawyers for the environmental campaigners had asked for leave to seek
a judicial review of Scottish Secretary Ian Lang's decision to license
the Spar's disposal in deep water 150 miles north-west of the Outer
Hebrides.
Ms Burton said the case had been taken to the High Court because the
pressure group had legal standing in England but not Scotland.
She added: ''Our advice was that there was jurisdiction in either
court because the Secretary of State for Scotland has an office in both
Scotland and England and the decision he made was a decision of the UK
Government.
''The effect of that decision would be equally felt in every part of
the UK because it involves an installation at sea.
''Also, the basis of the challenge was his failure to apply
international law agreed by the UK Government, not just the Scottish
Office.''
She said the Scottish courts took a much narrower view of what groups
had legal standing.
In a press release yesterday afternoon, Greenpeace claimed the English
High Court decision had been based on a ''legal technicality''. It said:
''This decision means that no British court can hear Greenpeace
challenge the Government. In effect it is a decision by the UK
Government to allow Shell to dump toxic chemicals and radioactive waste
at sea.''
Ms Burton denied that this wording was a slap in the face for the
Scottish courts.
The original interdict against the protesters on board the Brent Spar
had been sought through Scottish courts.
Ms Burton said the original interdict and Greenpeace challenge were
entirely different because the former was a private matter and the
latter of public importance. She said: ''If this is a slap in the face
for the Scottish legal system then it is by its own Secretary of
State.''
She said the Scottish Office could have given an undertaking not to
challenge the legal standing of Greenpeace in the Scottish courts but
refused. She declined to comment further because her experience was in
the English system.
She said Scottish legal advisers would be consulted over the next
step. Greenpeace might back an appropriate individual willing to front a
legal action or the group might choose to appeal against the High Court
ruling, she said.

TRIBUTES to Lord Wilson were paid by former colleagues, adversaries,
and admirers with many focusing on his leadership skills, some on his
approachability, and others on his sense of humour.
Sir Edward Heath said: ''I think probably his most remarkable feat . .
. was to bring his party together after Hugh Gaitskell died and then to
win the '64 election even though it was by such a small majority.''
Lord Callaghan: ''He was by nature a conciliator and the least
self-assertive of men, but he fought with the doggedness and
determination of a true Northerner when he had to.
''He was the most successful leader that Labour has ever had, winning
four elections out of five.''
Baroness Thatcher: ''I always admired his wit and often appreciated
his kindness.''
Joe Haines, Harold Wilson's former press secretary: ''Quite the nicest
of men I have ever worked for. He was fun to work with. He could knock
himself and had no sense of self-importance whatsoever..''
Baroness Castle: ''He told me more than once 'I've always seen it as
my duty to hold this party together and nothing will shift me from
that'. So he was prepared to adopt ignoble attitudes for a noble aim.''
Lord Jenkins: ''We sometimes had our ups and downs together and
represented rather different streams of thought and style within the
Labour Party, but I remember him with a lot of affection.''
Michael Foot: ''He knew howto win political victories, which was a
very good thing. That's one thing we will remember him for.''
Lord (formerly Reg) Prentice: ''He was a nice man, kindly and very
considerate towards people. This was even though he was cross with me
from time to time over my actions.''
Lord (Len) Murray: ''He was a breed of politician, like Churchill,
Macmillan, and Callaghan, whose attitude to politics was shaped by the
war.
''He regarded unions both as a force for progress and a possible
obstacle to change. He was challenging us to face reality and inventing
new realism.''
Jack Jones: ''His great contribution was in trying to get a united
Labour movement. A lot of people sneer about his beer and sandwiches
approach but the fact is he was prepared to tackle the problems faced by
working people.''
Jeremy Thorpe: ''He was a good friend and a formidable opponent. He
was a great parliamentarian and a dedicated democrat.''
Frank Steele, a diplomat in Ireland during Harold Wilson's government
in the early 1970s: ''He had Alzheimer's disease and Lady Wilson has
been terrific in the way she has looked after him. She will be terribly
sorry but also mercifully relieved. The last few weeks have been
terrible for her.''
Tony Benn: ''He was a very kind man, full of common sense -- very
amusing, colourful, and imaginative. When people look at the balance of
his contribution, it was enormous. He strongly supported Clause 4, won
four elections, and worked with the left unlike most Labour leaders
since.''
Neil Kinnock: ''Harold Wilson will long be remembered as a leader of
great political skills whose mission was the social and economic
modernisation of Britain. His huge abilities and his humour won him
respect and affection.''
Michael Howard: ''What he did was for the best of motives and the best
of intentions. He was a devastatingly effective parliamentary
performer.''
Sir Bernard Ingham: ''He was an enormously capable debater on the
floor of the House. He also had an enormous sense of humour. To be
frank, he reminded me so much of John Major -- entirely different
personalties, but similar in the circumstances in which they found
themselves. Harold Wilson spent most of the time trying to hold his
party together and the parallel is rather interesting.''
Jimmy Knapp: ''It is easy to forget how Harold Wilson dominated
politics in the 1960s and 1970s. He often involved himself personally in
trying to resolve disputes, which is unheard of now. He also led
Cabinets of far superior ability to recent Tory Cabinets.''
George Robertson: ''Harold Wilson was a dominating influence on my
generation -- and his inspiration before 1964 brought many like me into
the Labour Party. His skills as a communicator were remarkable and his
impact often dramatic. His rapport with the British public was quite
unique and hugely valuable to him.''
Alex Salmond: ''He was the best opposition leader of this century . .
. he was a man of the people and a master of the sound bite. Probably
the first UK politician to realise the potential of television, many of
his phrases have entered modern political vocabulary.''
Paul McCartney: ''He was a very nice man, a really nice bloke and
he was very canny too. We discovered that when we were at some show
together one night, Harold and us the Beatles, and some TV company asked
us (the Beatles) to interview Harold and they gave us a mike.
''We started talking to him but he just took the mike off us and put
it in his jacket pocket and carried on smoking his pipe.''

FLYING conditions were ''fine'' last night despite the thunderstorm at
the time of the Bandeirante's crash, the managing director of
Leeds-Bradford airport insisted.
While there was low cloud and rain in the area at the time of the
crash, the exact situation would not be known until investigators
studied Met Office reports, said Mr Bill Savage.
The pilot would have been relying on instruments to fly in what were
termed ''instrument meteorological conditions'', he added. These meant
the pilot relied on instrument read-outs rather than visual reference to
the ground.
He told a news conference: ''Conditions were fine for flying.
''We have been operating normally all day and are continuing to
operate normally. We would not be able to operate outwith Civil Aviation
Authority safety requirements.''
The aircraft would have had three crew -- a captain, co-pilot, and
stewardess -- and 16-18 seats, depending on the layout.
Mr Savage said: ''We are devastated about this tragic accident. Our
sympathy goes out to everybody concerned.''
He said Leeds-Bradford had worked closely with Knight Air for several
years, adding: ''The airline's safety record has been exemplary. We are
not going to speculate or comment about what might have been the cause
of the accident.''
The airline's commercial director, Mr Tim Russell, said the aircraft
had taken off from Leeds after arriving from Southampton for its
scheduled connection.
Knight Air operates four of the same twin-turbo prop make and two
other business aircraft. Three daily scheduled flights leave
Leeds-Bradford for Aberdeen.
The airline has been in business aviation operations for about 13
years, and has been operating scheduled flights for 18 months from
Leeds-Bradford.
Mr Russell said: ''I must emphasise we have great experience in moving
business passengers from Leeds-Bradford and other airports, and have
experience of operating throughout Europe. Our scheduled flights operate
throughout the British Isles.''
He was unable to say why the pilot had requested to return to
Leeds-Bradford airport, or to give any details about the message.
However, he did confirm that on May 9, another of the company's
scheduled flights to Aberdeen put down at RAF Leeming, North Yorkshire,
after taking off from Leeds-Bradford. He could not confirm that it was
the same aircraft involved in last night's crash. He did not know the
exact circumstances of why it landed at the RAF base.
However, he said it landed under normal procedures appropriate to the
incident at the time.
''I would point out that from time to time incidents do occur with
aircraft. Thankfully, until this moment, our particular record, in terms
of safety and reliability, has been exemplary,'' said Mr Russell.
Commuter air traffic -- a regular feature in the US -- is still in its
infancy in the UK, but is set to grow.
Operations like the one run by Knight Air faced immense difficulties
until the 1993 ''open skies'' policy in Europe opened up more flight
possibilities.
Until then, small aircraft operators were limited to starting up
within the UK. Very few of these domestic routes proved particularly
lucrative, and a number of new companies quickly went out of business.

THE House of Commons united in grief yesterday after the death of Lord
Wilson, Labour's most successful Prime Minister. He died peacefully in
his sleep at the age of 79.
Harold Wilson as Prime Minister had provided for the fledgling Tony
Blair his historic achievement for their party of being the ''natural
party of government''.
Mr Blair, who was just 22 when Lord Wilson resigned in 1976, said
simply: ''Harold Wilson set out to become the best -- and he did.''
Mr Major's tribute to Harold Wilson was generous. He admired his first
class brain and his grasp of politics.
Lord Wilson's guiding influence, Lady Falkender, said she was at his
bedside until two hours before he died. She said she bade farewell at St
Thomas's Hospital, London, with a squeeze of the hand, but no last
words.
His former private and political secretary, as Marcia Williams, said
she sat alongside his wife Mary. Lady Falkender, 63, whose volatile
partnership with Mr Wilson spanned almost 40 years, said: ''He was very
peaceful indeed. No words were exchanged as he drifted in and out of
consciousness.''
Lady Wilson, dressed in mourning black, later sat in the public
gallery alongside a tearful Lady Falkender listening to the tributes.
Nobody mentioned precisely the great Wilson achievement of uniting a
party in desperate times and persuading the public that it could rule.
The Prime Minister and Mr Blair were in their teens when Wilson was
surviving in the middle 60s as Prime Minister night after night with
majorities of one or two and a rampant solemn Labour left wing.
Mr Major in his tribute spoke of his ability to bring even Labour
opponents into his Ministry. ''And of course he was the only British
Prime Minister to have presided when Britain won the World Cup. A
remarkable man,'' said Mr Major who confessed he watched him on
television and followed his techniques on the radio.
The Prime Minister said Lord Wilson was ''a complex man, a clever man,
a man who could be bruised and hurt and who never wore the
armadillo-skin of the fictional politician''.
He added: ''In the ledger of life his credit balance is very high. It
is a privilege for me as one of his nominal political opponents to pay
tribute to him and I do so unreservedly.''
Mr Blair confessed that he was only 11 when Wilson was dominating a
decade of politics. He did not see him against Harold Macmillan in the
Commons. He did not witness his destruction of Sir Alec Douglas-Home in
his year of premiership following Macmillan.
He did not see the new Tory leader, Margaret Thatcher, set about
Wilson as Prime Minister and his successor Jim Callaghan. Mr Blair saw
none of this, but Lord Wilson's death yesterday has reminded the Commons
and the nation that Labour can form a respectable and trustworthy
government.
Wilson and the Beatles, who received OBEs from him, were the 60s. Mr
Blair told the Commons yesterday: ''In 1964 he symbolised the new mood
of change, after 13 years of unbroken Conservative rule.''
He added: ''It is fashionable now to knock the 60s and no doubt, like
any age it had its share of faults. But for many it was a time when
opportunity began, horizons opened and ambition and aspiration were
spread to a multitude of people previously denied them.''
Wilson took government after what he called 13 years of ''wasted Tory
years''. Within two years Mr Blair hopes to take government after what
he will call 16 or 17 wasted Tory years. The whole House of Commons was
aware yesterday of the poignancy of the situation of the death of Lord
Wilson of Rievaulx.
The presence in the public gallery of his widow, their sons and
daughters-in-law along with Lady Falkender indicated that the malicious
press reports about their relationship over 30 years was maligned.
Lady Falkender is said to have been one of the elements in his
astonishing decision to resign as Prime Minister at the height of his
powers in March 1976.
Nobody in the Commons yesterday thought this presence of Lady Wilson
and her husband's controversial political secretary worth remarking.
Yesterday Parliament praised Wilson in the Lords and Commons, but
particularly in the Commons where he had always been recognised as a
brilliant performer.
Many present like Sir Edward Heath, now Father of the House, who had a
ding-dong election battle with Wilson in the 60s -- Wilson won four of
them -- were content to be reminded by Heath and others of the
brilliance of the man at the Despatch Box.
The Prime Minister acknowledged that Wilson was the consummate
politician in his moving tribute. It was the Ulster Unionist leader, Mr
James Molyneaux, who emphasised this when he insisted that Wilson's
achievements should not be regarded solely as keeping his party united.
Mr Molyneaux said poignantly: ''It is only that some are better at
doing this than others.'' Mr Major who needs Mr Molyneaux's Ulster
Unionist votes as his majority falls to about nine with the Perth and
Kinross by-election tonight led the laughter in the Commons on this
Wilsonic party political joke.
Even Wilson in his heyday of intrigue and skulduggery, could not have
imagined that his legacy to the Labour Party by his death yesterday
could have been so apposite.

THE last contact I made with Harold Wilson was the morning after the
last General Election in 1992.
I telephoned Lady Wilson, in the obscure hope that she might relay a
reflection from the former Labour Prime Minister on the Conservatives'
fourth successive victory. She did not exactly say so, but I formed the
distinct impression that he did not know there had been an election. It
was very sad.
They were packing to leave for the Scillies that day. They continued
to lead life in a similar routine to that they had followed through much
of their lives. When they were in London, until relatively recently they
would turn up occasionally at political receptions and diplomatic
cocktail parties and Harold would chat and smile and have a drink,
although Mary would remind him that he wasn't really meant to.
The difference, though, was that Mary was always there, always at his
side, tactfully ensuring that nothing went wrong, smoothing over any
difficulties that emerged in the conversation, reminding him of the
names of people he had known all his long life. She seemed perfectly
reconciled to performing this service for him, but there was something
slightly odd about it: almost as if they were occupying the reverse
roles of their former lives.
The one place to which Mary did not accompany him was the House of
Lords. He continued to go there and there were, of course, plenty of
people around to help him if he needed it -- many of them his own former
Cabinet Ministers -- but he still cut a sad, rather pathetic, and lonely
figure.
He seemed almost completely to have lost his long-term memory. It was
a cruel blow for a man who had prided himself on a prodigious memory and
would frequently astonish the House of Commons by playing tricks like Mr
Memory and unexpectedly citing dates.
I had learned that something was wrong in the mid-80s when I went to
interview him at the time of the Spycatcher revelations by the late
Peter Wright. I arrived at their flat in Westminster and Mary
unexpectedly announced that she would join us for the interview. It was
just as well she did. She was vital.
''You remember, Harold,'' she would say, trying to nudge his memory,
when he looked puzzled by some of my questions. But it didn't work. And
then he turned to her and asked: ''What was the year in which we had two
elections?''
It was an extraordinary question coming from him, particularly as the
year in question was only just over a decade beforehand.
They had both always been very kind to me. During the early 1970s, in
Wilson's period as Opposition leader, I worked for the Labour Party
newspaper, Labour Weekly, and went to interview Mary Wilson about her
poetry in their house in Lord North Street. It was a charming small
early Georgian terrace house and it felt comfortable -- although not as
homely as their former house in Hampstead Garden Suburb which I had also
visited.
When Labour won the subsequent election in 1974, it was easy to see
why Mary Wilson put her foot down and insisted that they kept their
house as their home and merely used No 10 for business purposes.
The interview must have gone well (although I do remember putting my
foot in it by mentioning the Private Eye spoof Mrs Wilson's Diary which
she simply hated) for ever afterwards she always had time to talk to me.
At official receptions in No 10, which she was known to dislike and at
which she was sometimes to be found sitting alone on a sofa, she would
seek me out and ask my news. As she seemed to approve of me, it seemed
that he, too, was always ready with a kindly word for an impressionable
young reporter.
I remember telling her once that I had just landed a job on the
Guardian. ''Oh Harold!'' she said, ''Did you hear? The Guardian!''
''I was offered a job on the Guardian once,'' he retorted. I seem to
recall that he said he had decided to accept a job in the Government
instead. His greatest kindness was that even as Prime Minister, and even
more so after his retirement, he was always available for an interview,
a quote on some topic of current interest.
Another friend of mine, who is now in a distinguished post in
broadcasting, also found him very kind. She was sitting once with a
stop-watch during a live interview between the Prime Minister and her
political editor. The wire from the personal microphones to the
cameraman had caught in the hem of her dress. It was at the time of
crochet dresses and each time any of them moved her dress unravelled by
a few more yards.
It was a long interview and she sat there in increasing horror. When
it ended, Wilson's first question was to check that she was all right.
He had seen what was happening and watched her alarm. ''I don't remember
a word that I said,'' he told her.

TWELVE people were killed last night when a commuter plane en route to
Aberdeen crashed in a tree-lined valley in West Yorkshire during a
thunderstorm.
Witnesses at the scene told of wreckage scattered across a cornfield,
leaving bodies and fragments of plane strewn over 300 yards.
The Brazilian-built Embraer Bandeirante had been carrying nine
passengers and three crew when it crashed beside the A61 at Dunkeswick
in West Yorkshire.
It had taken off from Leeds-Bradford at 5.46pm. Minutes later the
pilot radioed a request to return to the airport: the plane then
vanished from air traffic control radar.
A Civil Aviation Authority spokesman said the plane -- call sign
Knight Air 816 -- was operated by Knight Air, which is based at
Leeds-Bradford airport.
On May 9 one of the airline's Bandeirante aircraft made an emergency
landing at RAF Leeming in North Yorkshire after reporting engine
problems. The plane landed safely and the passengers were transferred to
the company's other Bandeirante.
It was believed six of yesterday's victims lived in Scotland,
including one from Glasgow and four from the Grampian area.
The flight had been due to arrive at Aberdeen at around 6.45pm.
Last night Mr Robbie McGregor, the Scottish general manager for
Servisair, the handling agents for Knight Air in Aberdeen, said that the
Bandeirante aircraft had an excellent safety record and had been flying
the Aberdeen to Leeds/Bradford route for two years.
He said the pilot, first officer and stewardess from the crashed
aircraft were all from the Leeds/Huddersfield area.
He said there had been relatives waiting for passengers at the airport
but they had been looked after by representatives of Aberdeen Airport
and Grampian police.
As police and ambulances rushed to the scene, one witness, Mr Anthony
Pickard, told how he had called the rescue services on his mobile phone.
He said there was ''utter carnage'' after the plane broke up on
impact. ''It was a horrific sight. The plane was just in pieces, spread
over a very wide area and there were bodies strewn all over the field.
It was not the sort of thing I would want to see ever again.''
Mr Pickard, whose daughter Sally, a nurse, also went to the scene,
said there was ''little or no chance'' that anyone could have survived.
He said he had first heard the plane, which appeared to be having
problems, as it flew over his garage. It then vanished behind a hill.
Seconds later he and other residents heard ''a huge explosion''.
The scene is just two miles from Harewood House, the stately home of
the queen's cousin Lord Harewood.
Ms Sharon Moore, deputy manager of the Harewood Arms hotel nearby,
said: ''We heard a loud bang, like a clap of thunder, but it turned out
to be the plane coming down.
''There has been torrential rain and thunder and lightning in the area
for the last three hours or so.''
Other witnesses said the weather conditions had been appalling, with
torrential rain and thunder and lightning.
At the cordoned-off crash site, the police officer in charge, Chief
Inspector Paul Gregory, said rescue workers had been severely hampered
by the muddy conditions and the field's remoteness.
''It's very difficult for the fire brigade, police, air-sea rescue and
the ambulance service, but they are doing their very best in these
difficult conditions,'' he said.
The emergency services were forced to scramble across a water-logged
field to reach the crash scene which was 600 yards from the nearest
road.
The field where the plane crashed is part of the 1000-acre Prospect
House Farm, owned by Mr Peter Trickett.
Mr Trickett said the aircraft had come down near the River Wharfe.
He had not seen the crash but another local resident, who gave her
name as Mrs Franklin, said she heard the aircraft ''spluttering'' as it
flew over the village.
''It was flying very low and was obviously in trouble but it seemed to
have picked up again. Then, the next thing we knew, there was a big bang
and we knew it had crashed.''
She said the plane had dug itself into the field very deeply with the
force of the impact.
Divisional Officer Colin Chadfield of North Yorkshire Fire Brigade
said two fire engines had arrived at the scene within 15 minutes. He
said nine casualties were confirmed inmmediately.
Police cordoned off the area and set up an aircraft accident site near
Harewood Bridge, six miles north-east of the airport.
Inspectors from the Department of Transport's air accident
investigation branch were travelling to the area last night, a
department spokesman said.
He said they would be examining the wreckage and if necessary would
take parts to the AAIB headquarters at Farnborough, Hampshire. ''If they
find anything that has any implications for other aircraft they will
contact all operators as soon as possible,'' he said.
One man waiting for the delayed return flight to Leeds said he and his
fellow passengers had been given the choice by Servisair of a free taxi
from Aberdeen to Leeds or waiting until the flight took off.
''This is my first time on the flight so I am now a bit apprehensive
about taking it,'' he said. Some passengers opted to take the taxi ride
to Leeds. Others waited for another flight today.
Transport Minister Brian Mawhinney expressed his sympathy to the
families of those in the accident and called for an early report from
investigators. ''I am extremely grateful to the emergency services for
their prompt response,'' said Dr Mawhinney.
The plane took off in rapidly reducing visibility after what had been
a hot, hazy summer day that ended in thunderstorms. The nearest houses
to the crash scene were about a mile away in the village of Dunkeswick.
Weather conditions could hold the key to investigators working out
what went wrong.
A thunderstorm was raging at the time, presenting the crew of the
small commuter aircraft with serious problems.
The main danger during a thunderstorm -- especially to a small plane
-- is that air currents and turbulence could be so severe that they
actually break up an aircraft in flight.
Another thunderstorm problem is ice forming on the wings and
tailplane.
The twin-engined Bandeirante are common short-haul aircraft. More than
500 are currently flying throughout the world.
In production since 1968, they were the foundation of Brazil's air
industry and are powered by twin Pratt and Whitney engines built in
Canada.
They are commonly used as commuter planes and are popular with
businessmen.
An information line has been set up by Grampian police on 01224 639111
ext. 2531 or 2532.

THE old order changeth, giving place to new: that's as true of
restaurants as anything else, and in novelty-hungry Glasgow it's truer
than almost anywhere else. The last time I was in the building that is
now the Thai Fountain at Charing Cross, quite a few years ago, it was
just The Fountain, one of the tony old school of Glasgow French
restaurants devoted to that elaborate school of haute cuisine in which
things were stuffed with other things stuffed with other things yet, and
the only things richer than the clientele were the sauces.
Me, I was washing the dishes then; but although I've fallen to the
level of journalism since then, the changing of the guard at 2 Woodside
Crescent suggests a subtler change in Glasgow dining habits over the
years. What many of us seem to want nowadays in a good dinner is
lightness, fragrance, delicacy, and a touch of the exotic, things that
Thai cooking in general and the Thai Fountain in particular are well
qualified to supply.
Open for just a year now, the Thai Fountain has been gradually
bringing Glasgow's regular browsers and sluicers around to a more
sophisticated idea of what Thai food is like, conquering the received
image of white-hot, chilli-packed soups and stews. Thailand being where
it is in the world, its cuisine is a piquant melange of influences
including the tang of Szechuen Chinese, the coolness and fragrance of
Malaysian cooking, the creaminess and mildness of southern India, and
even a touch of North Africa in the spices department.
But if you're still a shade nervous about those chillies, the Thai
Fountain's menu marks with little chilli signs those dishes that could
conceivably be a problem to those of a tender palate -- and really,
they're remarkably few on a list of 99 items. Tastes you're at least as
likely to encounter include lemon grass, lime leaf, coriander, and an
indescribable but unmistakable Thai favouring called galan-ka -- all of
which you'll find in the Thai Fountain's celebrated soups, a bowl of
which should be a part of any meal you have here.
Like many eastern cuisines, Thai cooking goes in strongly for a poetic
line in names for its dishes: starters at the Thai Fountain included
Bags of Gold (dry bean curd wrappers with an ''exotic stuffing'') and
the main courses feature Hot Pan Beef (Weeping Tiger) -- whose title is
explained with a footnote to the effect that ''the tiger will be weeping
for more''. At the Thai Fountain, the exotic and wonderful starts with
the written word.
The Thai classic of green curry with coconut milk, with its
contradictory tastes of sweet and sour and hot and salty, is done as
well at the Thai Fountain as I've tasted anywhere, even in Amsterdam
where Thai restaurants are two to the guilder, and another speciality of
the house, the ever-present Thai Satay, defied its status as a cliche of
Thai cooking.
Knowing that the eyes and the nose are as much the organs of appetite
as the tongue, the Thai Fountain puts a lot of care into the
presentation of its food, which is a veritable picture on a plate: one
almost feels one should take a Polaroid and then go home. Scents, too,
are enchanting, sharp and sour and and sweet in turn, and things like
these do a lot to make a meal a pleasure. Never at the Thai Fountain
does one get the feeling that the meal placed in front of one is going
to be an endurance course as much as an item of nourishment: this is
food to tickle the palate, not beat it to death with a big stick.
The physical surroundings are equally pleasant and predisposed to
serenity: two rooms, one larger and dimmer than the other, with a
pleasant, slightly underwater green feeling about it; the other has by
comparison a crispness and brightness that suggest lunch more than
dinner.
Prices at the Thai Fountain are eminently reasonable for the standard
of cooking -- starters are from roughly #4 to #7, with entrees in the #7
to #11 range -- and there are two-course lunch (noon to 2pm, #6.90) and
pre-theatre (6pm to 7pm, #11.90) available. The best bargain on the
card, perhaps, is the Thai Banquet at #22 per person, which is an
excellent way to sample nine or 10 different dishes from the
restaurant's repertoire.
The wine list, meanwhile, covers around 50 labels and has a strong
selection of decent bottles in the #10 to #20 range: I'd recommend
something like a nice floral Alsace to go with the milder dishes, and
perhaps a big beefy burgundy to accompany the stronger meat courses.
Congratulations to the Thai Fountain on its first birthday: many happy
returns.

FOLLOWING the success of The Scottish Council on Alcohol's awards
inauguration last year, the Council is expanding its scheme to reach all
employment sectors backed by its 28 affiliated local agencies. At a
launch ceremony held recently, the council reiterated its aim to
recognise Scottish employers who have shown best practice in the
implementation of alcohol policies and procedures for helping employees
with problems in the workplace.
Sponsor of the initiative is the Portman Group which was set up in
1989 by the eight leading UK alcohol producers to promote sensible
drinking and tackle alcohol-related damage.
In a message at the launch of the awards scheme, Lord Fraser of
Carmyllie, Minister of Home Affairs and Health, said: ''I wish to
commend the SCA for its enterprise in devising and implementing this
worthwhile scheme. I am sure that this initiative will serve as an
important catalyst in persuading employees in Scotland to develop
policies in the workplace for dealing with problems arising from alcohol
misuse..''
Entries are invited from any employer in Scotland operating a policy
which addresses alcohol problems. An operational policy is the only
necessary entry qualification but this must have established clear
procedures enabling management to deal with problems in the workplace
arising from alcohol misuse.
The company must also promote the adoption of guidelines on safe and
sensible drinking throughout all levels of the organisation and promote
a training programme on safe and sensible drinking at the workplace. It
is perfectly acceptable if this is part of an overall employee
assistance policy.
By taking part in the awards scheme a company will raise the profile
of an important health-related issue, enhance employee relations, and
put to the test existing policies.
It has attracted the full support of the Scottish Office, Cosla,
Scottish Enterprise, STUC, Scottish Chambers of Commerce, Institute of
Directors and the CBI in Scotland, whose director Lex Gold is
vice-chairman of the award's national judging panel.
In launching the awards on behalf of The SCA, Lex Gold, said: ''The
primary assets of any company are its employees. This scheme recognises
the fact and encourages all employers to adopt sensible policies and
practices to help minimise problems of alcohol misuse in the workplace
and to help those with alcohol problems.''
Market research company System 3 Scotland was commissioned by The SCA
to consider awareness of and attitudes towards alcohol in the workplace.
Almost 1100 adults who were considered representative of the Scottish
adult population in terms of age, sex and social class were interviewed
in March this year.
The findings of the research revealed that those in the highest social
groups ABC1 were aware of drinking at work but did not view this as a
major source of problems. It also stated that employees were in favour
with the introduction of workplace policies to assist those with alcohol
problems and these would be well received.
The SCA's executive director, Douglas Allsop, said: ''Through our
specialist employer advisory service A Working Concern we have already
heightened awareness in the importance of alcohol policies and staff
training in this field. A good workplace alcohol programme can help
reduce absenteeism and improve labour relations.''
A Working Concern was pioneered by the SCA and it provides employers
with a range of services tailored to meet the individual needs of a
company with support from experienced staff who will help develop
effective policies relating to alcohol in the workplace.
Dr John Rae of the Portman Group, said: ''The success of last year's
awards has been extremely encouraging. We are delighted to be supporting
the SCA which shares our own aims of promoting sensible drinking and
preventing alcohol misuse.''
Highly commended and excellence category winners will receive framed
certificates and a desk-top trophy. Winners will also have the right to
use the award symbol on all stationery for the three-year duration of
the award.
Winners of awards last year were convinced that involvement in the
scheme brought important benefits. Mr Ian Fyffe, welfare officer of the
Post Office, said: '' An alcohol policy educates employees about the
harmful effects of excessive alcohol use and helps to identify problem
drinkers at an early stage and encourages them to seek help.
Application forms can be obtained from The SCA, 137/145 Sauchiehall
Street, Glasgow, G2 3EW and all applications must be received by Friday,
July 28. All award winners will be invited to attend a reception to
receive their prize on November 20.

RACE results should be announced within 30 seconds of a finish thanks
to the introduction of high-tech camera equipment in the judges' box.
Trials began yesterday of the ''Hawkeye'' system, designed to produce
almost instant images and greatly speed up photo-finish verdicts.
The black and white system, to be used in tandem with the current
colour photo-finish process, will have an immediate impact on off-course
betting. ''We operate the only colour photo-finish system in the world
but its major disadvantage is that it is not fast enough for the
off-course market,'' explained Racetech managing director Sim Harris.
''This new system will enable us to call the result of most races
within 30 seconds and will be gradually introduced over the next few
months.''
Senior judge Jonathan Dimsdale said: ''In some jump races the result
can be announced nine minutes after the off when races are timed to take
place every 10 minutes.
''That leaves the off-course punter one minute to collect his winnings
and reinvest. In future we hope to announce 80% of photos within 30
seconds.''
* LOOK for Jolto making amends for a recent Lingfield defeat when he
contests the Kidsons Impey Trophy at Goodwood this afternoon.
The consistent six-year-old made a pleasing reappearance in the
Victoria Cup at Ascot.
In this very competitive handicap Jolto set out to make all the
running and kept on once headed to finish close behind the
well-handicapped Jawal.
Favourite for his next outing over seven and a half furlongs at
Lingfield, Jolto was disappointing, fading to finish sixth to Greenwich
Again. The Goodwood track should suit this front-runner ideally and
Jolto is taken to make all the running and put a smile back on his
supporters' faces.
At the same meeting Son Of Sharp Shot can win his fifth consecutive
race. Trained by John Dunlop, he has won both his starts this year, most
recently quickening well to win a good handicap at Chester.

ERIC Elwood has won a recall to the Ireland team for their opening
match against New Zealand in Johannesburg on Saturday.
Elwood is preferred to Paul Burke for the fly-half berth, and the
Irish hope his kicking ability can help them spring a Pool C surprise
against the All Blacks.
''We will not be intimidated at the thought of playing New Zealand,''
said Ireland manager Noel Murphy. ''They are one of the leading
contenders for the World Cup, and this is a very tough game. But we are
happy that this is our first group game.
''We may have a reputation for being unpredictable, but there have
been times when we rise to a challenge. Just look to the last World Cup
and remember how we nearly beat Australia.'' Team:
J Staples; R Wallace, B Mullin, J Bell, S Geoghegan; E Elwood, M
Bradley; N Popplewell, T Kingston (captain), G Halpin, N Francis, G
Fulcher, D Corkery, P Johns, D McBride. Replacements -- M Field, P
Burke, N Hogan, A Foley, P Wallace, K Wood.
* ROMANIAN Tiberiu Brinza has lost his battle against injury and will
miss his country's opening match. A damaged shoulder has ruled out the
27-year-old No.8 for the Pool A match against Canada in Port Elizabeth
tomorrow. Team:
G Solomie; I L Colceriu, N Raceanu, R Gontineac, I Rotaru; N
Nichitean, D Neaga; O Slusariuc, A Gealapu, T Oroian, C Cojocariu, S
Ciorascu (captain), G Vlad, I Negreci, G Leonte.

TWO Scots proved better than one yesterday in the second round of the
men's doubles at the world championships in Lausanne, Switzerland, when
Alistair Gatt and Craig Robertson beat fellow Scot Bruce Flockhart and
his Irish partner Eugene McKenna 15-13, 15-6.
However, joy for Gatt and Robertson was brief as they were beaten by
Jon Holst-Christensen and Thomas Lund in a later round.
Scotland's top women's doubles partnership of Elinor Allen and her
sister Jenny Williamson lost to world No.8 pair Xingyong Peng and Jin
Zhang 15-7, 15-3 to end Scottish interest in the event.
The Scots almost managed to take a game from the 1994 Dutch and German
Open winners in the first, when they led 12-10, but the Chinese proved
just too fast.
The match was Williamson's last in a Scotland shirt after a career
which earned her more than 100 caps. Results:
J Haldane and G Martin lost to A Jorgensen and L Olsen 15-13, 15-13; A
Gatt and C Robertson beat B Flockhart (Scotland) and E McKenna (Ireland)
15-13, 15-6; J Williamson and E Allen lost to X Peng and J Zhang (China)
15-13, 15-7; C Robertson and A Gatt lost to T Lund and J
Holst-Christensen (Denmark) 15-4, 15-1.

CHRIS Eubank should expect no more than a token gesture of hardship
when he meets Argentinian Bruno Godoy on Saturday night at the King's
Hall, Belfast.
Godoy arrived in Ireland yesterday claiming he would ''knock out''
Eubank, but his record of 29 wins, 10 defeats, and five draws suggests
otherwise.
The 32-year-old from Neuquen could hardly have had a worse start to
his professional career in 1987, when he was stopped in the third round
on his debut, and since then he has suffered seven more defeats inside
the distance.
Far from being a raging bull, Eubank's comeback opponent seems quite
reserved, although naturally he sees the opportunity to pull off a major
upset which could turn his career and life around.
''I have nine children and they all need feeding, so that's my main
motivation and I believe I will beat Eubank on Saturday night -- though
I realise he is a very strong fighter,'' said Godoy.
''This would give me a great chance to help my family and help the
kids at the gymnasium which I run.''
Eubank, who will be having his first fight since losing the World
Boxing Organisation super-middleweight title to Dubliner Steve Collins,
is expected to fly into the province tomorrow for the weigh-in.
Ulsterman Eamonn Loughran, meanwhile, is keen to impress his local
fans in his first fight at home for 15 months when he defends the WBO
welterweight title against the Dominican Republic's Angel Beltre, on the
same bill.
Loughran got a welcome boost yesterday when he was presented with the
Northern Ireland boxer of the year award, and he said: ''I hope I can
put on a show worthy of this award.
''It's going to be a good night at the King's Hall and I want to go
out and give the public a good performance.''

PATTY Fendick and Jill Hetherington, former US Open champions, were
the first pair to reach the semi-final stage of the women's World
Doubles Cup at Craiglockhart yesterday when they recovered from a poor
start to beat No.3 seeds Nicole Arendt and Laura Golarsa.
The American and her Canadian partner were playing their first match
together since reaching the final of the Australian Open in 1989, and
lost the first four games to last week's Italian Open semi-finalists
before finding their form.
Fendick and Hetherington then reeled off the next eight games for the
loss of only six points and looked to have the match under control when
they established a 4-2 lead in the second set.
But Arendt and Golarsa broke Fendick's serve in the eighth game and
forced a tie-break, which the American-Canadian pair won for a 6-4, 7-6
victory.
Their opponents in tomorrow's semi-final will be second-seeds Manon
Bollegraf and Rennae Stubbs, who beat teenage wild cards Julie Pullin
and Lorna Woodroffe.
The English pair, surprise winners of last year's national
championships, were watched by British team-manager Anne Jones and
showed glimpses of their raw potential as they pulled back from 5-2 down
in the first set before the Dutch-Australian partnership clinched a 6-4,
6-3 victory in 66 minutes.
Australian Stubbs, best friend of Steffi Graf, later joked: ''It was
almost as cold as this at the German Open last week but this is the
first time I've played in fog.''
Former world No.1 Tracey Austin, who last played at Craiglockhart as a
15-year-old in the 1977 Scottish grass-court championships, partnered
John Lloyd to an entertaining 7-6, 6-1 victory over Roger Taylor and
Wendy Turnbull in the first round of the Legends event.
Austin, who kept her tracksuit on throughout the match much to
Taylor's dismay, showed she had lost little of her sharpness and
enthusiasm for the game.
''I still love to play,'' said Austin, ''and there is no pressure in
these Legends matches. We just go out there and have a good time.''
Today's order of play:
2.0pm -- M McGrath (USA) and L Neiland (Latvia) v M Lindstrom and M
Strandlund (Sweden). J Kriek (S Africa) and V Wade (GB) v J Lloyd (GB)
and T Austin (USA). K Adams and Z Garrison-Jackson (USA) v D Graham and
L Harvey-Wild (USA). R Taylor (GB) and W Turnbull (Australia) v R
Emerson (Australia) and J Durie (GB).
* CASTLE Farm continued the defence of their men's Everest National
Club League title yesterday when they edged past Newlands 4-2.
The Newcastle side were without Ross Matheson, Andrew Foster, and Gary
Henderson who are in Paris for the French Open qualifying, but proved to
have sufficient strength in depth to win three of the four singles and
one of the two doubles rubbers.
Former Scottish junior champion Calum McKnight survived a match point
on his way to a 3-6, 6-4, 7-5 win over Simon Parkinson and then teamed
up with Malcolm Watt to beat Parkinson and Sean Damer 6-1, 6-0.
Newlands women suffered their third successive whitewash when they
lost to Edgebaston Priory, a side which included national champion Jo
Ward.
The Glasgow side now must beat either Gosling or Holcombe Brooke in
this weekend's remaining fixtures to avoid relegation. Results:
Men. Castle Farm 4, Newlands 2 (T Spinks beat J Barnett 6-1, 6-2; J
Fox beat M Watt 6-4, 7-5, S Damer beat E McGinn 6-4, 7-6; S Parkinson
lost to C McKnight 3-6, 6-4, 7-5. Spinks and Fox beat Barnett and McGinn
7-5, 7-6; Damer and Parkinson lost to Watt and McKnight 6-1, 6-0).
Women. Edgebaston Priory 6, Newlands 0. (J Moore beat H Lockhart 6-2,
6-3; J Ward beat N Burns 6-2, 6-1; T Wainwright beat M Love 6-2, 6-1; K
Rickett beat J Shaw 6-0, 6-0. Moore and Ward beat Burns and Lockhart
7-6, 6-4; Rickett and Wainwright beat Love and Shaw 6-0, 6-1).

DAVID Barr, the holder, was in sparkling form last night despite
torrential rain which dogged the second round of the Regal Glasgow
Bowling Association Championships.
Barr needed just 12 ends to coast to a 21-2 win over Wellcroft's Sam
Greer on Fairfield.
Former world indoor champion Hugh Duff, from Cumbernauld, notched up
his second successive 21-7 win when he beat King's Park's Frank Toland
at Foxley, while veteran campaigner Donnie MacDonald, from the Glasgow
Gas club, an internationalist in the 70's, also is through to next

CLAIMS that England players could earn up to #30,000 a year as part of
a lucrative sponsorship deal still being negotiated have been labelled
''wide of the mark'' by a Rugby Football Union spokesman.
According to a radio report, six major companies are competing for the
right to back England to the tune of #60m over four years, which would
be the most lucrative rugby union sponsorship deal in the world.
The RFU confirmed that sponsorship discussions were on-going, but said
that players, who would be paid for promotional work, would not earn
enough to merit becoming full-time professionals.
* ERIC Elwood has won a recall to the Ireland team for their opening
match against New Zealand in Johannesburg on Saturday. He is preferred
to Paul Burke at fly-half, and the Irish hope his kicking can help them
spring a Pool C surprise against the All Blacks.
''We will not be intimidated at the thought of playing New Zealand,''
said Ireland manager Noel Murphy. ''They are one of the leading
contenders for the World Cup, and this is a very tough game. But we are
happy that this is our first group game. Team:
J Staples; R Wallace, B Mullin, J Bell, S Geoghegan; E Elwood, M
Bradley; N Popplewell, T Kingston (captain), G Halpin, N Francis, G
Fulcher, D Corkery, P Johns, D McBride. Replacements -- M Field, P
Burke, N Hogan, A Foley, P Wallace, K Wood.
* GARETH Thomas and Andy Moore will make their debuts for Wales in
their opening match against Japan in Bloemfontein on Saturday.
Bridgend threequarter Thomas will play on the left wing -- making his
international breakthrough in his first year in senior rugby.
Moore, the 6ft 3in, 20-year-old Cardiff scrum half, has also won a
place in the starting line-up following an impressive display in
training.
At the other end of the scale, former Wales captain Ieuan Evans wins
his fifty-second cap. Team:
A Clement; I Evans, M Hall (captain), N Jenkins, G Thomas; A Davies, A
Moore; M Griffiths, G Jenkins, J Davies, D Jones, G Llewellyn, S Davies,
E Lewis, H Taylor. Replacements -- W Proctor, D Evans, R Jones, S Roy, R
Evans, J Humphries.
* MANA Otai, the New Zealand-based No.8, will captain Tonga in their
opening Pool D match against France in Pretoria on Saturday. Team:
S Tu'ipulotu; A Taufa, U Va'enuku, P Latu, T Va'enuku; E Vunipola, M
Vunipola; M Otai (captain), I Fenukitau, F Mahoni, F Mafi, W Lose, T
Fukofuka, F Masila, S Fe'ao.

MIKE Tyson will return to the ring with a fight against 26-year-old
fellow American Peter McNeeley on August 19. The former world
heavyweight champion's first bout since being released from prison in
March will take place at the MGM Grand hotel in Las Vegas, and will be
his first fight in more than four years.
McNeeley has a record of 36 victories and just one defeat, but his
career has so far been loaded with lightly-regarded opponents.

A TWO-WEEK training camp in Lyons, followed by a trip to Winnipeg to
compete in the Canadian National championships, will make it a hectic
July for Scotland's leading swimmers.
An eight-strong team will be selected for both events following next
month's Scottish championships, and it will be at least some consolation
for those who missed out on a place in the British team for the European
championships in Vienna in August.
Graeme Smith is the only Scot to gain European selection, and the
France-Canada double will help such as Fraser Walker and Alison Sheppard
continue their build-up towards next year's Olympic bid. It would have
been a real set-back if they had not had some form of major event to
look forward to this summer.
''We have to include foreign trips in the programme to keep the
swimmers motivated,'' suggested Scottish team manager, Danny McGowan.
Meanwhile, Scotland is to join the English-backed campaign to prevent
synchronised swimming being excluded from the next Commonwealth Games,
in Kuala Lumpur in 1998.

THE Camanachd Association's development plan for the next four years
and a contentious proposal to introduce penalty shoot-outs to decide
Camanachd Cup finals which end in a draw will be the main talking points
at the annual meeting of clubs in Fort William tomorrow night.
The 32-page development plan has been hammered out by officials at a
series of meetings over the last few months and it will be presented for
approval before being passed on to the Scottish Sports Council, where it
will be produced in its final form.
Discussion of the document will be led by president Duncan Cameron,
who has overseen its production so far. He said: ''The paper has two
main themes -- increased participation at all levels of the game and
improved performances in all its aspects.
''The plan represents our vision of where we want to go, and it will
be vital in terms of projecting our requirements to various agencies,
such as the Scottish Sports Council, and also to other bodies whom we
may be hoping to attract in terms of funding.''
One of the key points in the plan is that it is a ''shared ownership''
with clubs. The association is calling on all clubs to adopt their own
development plans to run alongside the association's plan for the
future. A new membership is also being proposed with a #5 subscription
for adults, #10 for clubs, and #10 for associations.
The proposal to end Camanachd Cup finals with a penalty shoot-out in
the event of a draw is unlikely to attract the two thirds majority
required for such a move.
Other hoary old chestnuts liable to be roasted tomorrow night include
indiscipline and falling standards.
The report by Louis Stewart, chairman of the disciplinary committee
makes alarming reading.
No fewer than 56 players have been dealt with by his committee after
having been ordered off, an increase of 22 (64%) on the previous year.
Thirty-eight players have also been dealt with for having three
cautions, an increase of 41%, and one club official was suspended for
making abusive remarks to a referee.
Meanwhile, the referees' committee say they will need 40 new referees
to relieve the pressure on the existing pool of match officials.

MAYBE it is fitting in the last week of what has been a bizarre season
that a couple of days before the great finale at Hampden, two teams with
some of the finest traditions of any in the country are meeting head-on
in a confrontation to decide which one of them will be playing in the
top league next season.
In times gone by, Dunfermline and, in even more recent days, Aberdeen,
would have been sound candidates for a place in the cup final on
Saturday, rather than uncertainty about participating in the premier
division. But they have to face up to the realities of a play-off second
leg which the Pittodrie side enter with a 3-1 advantage.
Normally, it would be inconceivable that Aberdeen could be beaten by
two or more goals in such circumstances, but there has been very little
predictable about the relegation and promotion competitions this season,
and the Fifers are so full of confident determination that they will
need to be treated with the utmost respect.
They looked a decent team in the first leg at Pittodrie, and if they
had not lost a third goal in the closing minutes, they would be much
fancied to overtake their rivals for the coveted premier spot.
However, they are undeterred, and their manager, Bert Paton, has
decided to use the bugle call approach, literally, to try to achieve
what would be one of the Fife club's greatest victories. Two members of
the Royal Marine Band, David Green and Buster Brown, from Pitreavie
Maritime HQ, Dunfermline, have offered to lend the inspiration of their
ceremonial bugles. Paton has accepted happily.
''Charge is what my boys must do if they are to overturn the 3-1
defeat at Pittodrie,'' he said. ''We are coming out with all guns
blazing. There will be no holding back and the first goal will be of
supreme importance.''
He likened the importance of tomorrow night's game to Dunfermline's
European Cup-winners' tie against Valencia in 1962, when Jock Stein was
manager. ''We started the second leg four goals down but we beat
Valencia 6-2 at East End Park.
''Now we can create history by doing it again in the first premier
division promotion play-off. Sunday's game at Pittodrie has shown my
team they are every bit as good as Aberdeen. All we lacked were the
breaks.''
One jarring statistic might temper too much optimism. Dunfermline have
not beaten Aberdeen at home since 1972. The newly appointed Aberdeen
manager, Roy Aitken, has no intentions of seeing that record ended. His
reaction to the noises coming from East End Park was typically
forthright: ''No-one here is interested in anything that Dunfermline
have to say. We will do our talking on the park where it matters. They
are a good, strong experienced side. But if we approach this game
correctly, there will be no need to worry.
''I have no fears that my players will be ready. They will be
committed and up for a very important game. Any questions which have
been asked of them have been answered over the last couple of months.
Lots of people doubted their ability to handle this situation. They have
proved them wrong.
''It has given me satisfaction to see the way events have unfolded.
The players have given me everything I have demanded, but now they must
do it one more time.''
Aberdeen, who will be backed by 7000 fans, have Billy Dodds back after
suspension, and Paul Kane, who is also available after a ban, will be
used at some stage. Dunfermline have only 14 fit players from whom to
choose after Marc Millar and Paul Fenwick were ruled out.
* JIM Brown, the former Scotland goalkeeper, could make a dramatic
return to football at Wembley this weekend at the age of 43.
Brown, who began his career at Albion Rovers, has not played first
team football for almost seven years, but will be on the bench for
Chesterfield's third division play-off final against Bury.
First choice 'keeper Andy Beasley is out for two months after having
suffered a fractured cheekbone in last week's semi-final against
Mansfield and his deputy, Billy Stewart, has been nursing an ankle
injury.
Chesterfield's appeal to the Football League for special permission to
sign a goalkeeper was rejected, so Brown, who is now the club's
commercial manager, will cover for Stewart on Saturday.
* CLYDEBANK yesterday signed 20-year-old striker Scott Miller from
Possil YM. The youngster played for the club as a trialist in the recent
reserve match against Rangers in which Terry Butcher and other former
Ibrox men took part.

BECAUSE of financial restrictions, there will be no replacement for
any of the nine male athletes who have withdrawn from the Scottish
district teams selected for the Inter-county Championships at Bedford on
Sunday and Monday.
Walker Martin Bell, multiple title-winner and the most successful Scot
at these championships in recent years, is on UK duty in Hungary, while
Euan Calvert (800m), Grant Graham (mile), Robert Quinn and Adrian Callan
(5000m), Tom Murray (10,000m), Graeme Croll (3000m steeplechase), Dave
Barnetson (high jump) and Dave Allan (hammer) have all withdrawn for a
variety of reasons, mostly work-related.
''We took 79 competitors last year, but selected just 40 this time,
because money rules,'' said track convenor George Duncan yesterday. ''It
costs #120 per head, and rather than send people who who have not
reached the standard, we would rather spend the money on paying for
deserving youngsters to go to the AAA Junior Championships.''
Two women have withdrawn, Vikki McPherson, who has opted out of the
5000m because she races at Portsmouth on Saturday, and hurdler Sarah
Richmond, because of exams. They have been replaced, by hurdler Claire
McIntosh, and Alison Curbishley (400m).
It was at this contest last year that Pitreavie sprinter Ian Mackie
broke through. Though qualifying for the 200m final only as a fastest
loser, he took third in the final. Later he won bronze at the World
Junior championships in Lisbon.
Mackie is competing again, at 200m, and it will be interesting to see
how he fares against teen prodigy Ross Baillie. All eyes will also be on
the Victoria Park lad in the hurdles, where the East representative is
Ken Campbell, who twice broke the Scottish record last year.
The rivalry between Aileen McGillivary and Mel Neef, which produced a
catalogue of national and native records indoors during the winter, is
renewed, with both named for the 100 and 200m. Teams:
Men. 100 metres: J Henderson; 200m: I Mackie (both East), R Baillie;
400m: H Kerr (both West), J Beattie (E); 800m: A Young (W), J McFadyen
(E); 3k steeplechase: W Jenkins (W); 110m hurdles: K Campbell (E),
Baillie; 400m hurdles: M Davidson (N), B Middleton (E); Triple jump: N
McMenemy (E). Shot/discus: B Robb (E), S Hayward (W).
Women. 100/200m: A McGillivary (E), M Neef (W); 400m: A Curbishley
(E); 100m hurdles: C McIntosh (W); 400m hurdles: J Low (W), L Silver
(E); 3000m walk: V Snook; High/triple jumps: L Brown (E); Triple/long
jumps F Watt (W); Pole vault: G Marshall (W); Shot: A Grey (W), H Cowe
(N), T Shorts (E); Discus: C Garden (E), Grey, Cowe; Hammer: H McCreadie
(W), Garden; Javelin: L Jackson (E), J Walker (W).

DAVID Coulthard, preparing for Sunday's Monte Carlo Grand Prix, has
added his voice to the Nigel Mansell debate by telling the former world
champion that he should have quit when he was ahead.
''If he had bowed out after his last grand prix win in Australia that
perhaps would have been a fitting way to end,'' said Coulthard of
Mansell's decision to make a full-time comeback this season at the age
of 41. ''I have always admired his determination and the way he drove
cars made him so exciting to watch.
Mansell has left the door slightly ajar on the possibility of a grand
prix return sometime in the future, but Coulthard believes they will all
be closed as far as the top teams are concerned.
''My feeling is the only way you will see him come back is if it is
with a chance of winning,'' said Coulthard. ''It's difficult to see him
doing it if he can't be competitive.
''But it's unlikely he will get another top team now. When you think
of Nigel in Formula 1 or IndyCar you think of top-class racing, and
maybe that option is not there now.''
Mansell's hopes of a return to Williams were dashed when the team
decided to sign Coulthard, while Ferrari and McLaren will now
concentrate their interests on Germany's world champion Michael
Schumacher, whose contract with Benetton is up this year.

THE Scottish sailing fraternity may be saluting 20 years of what has
long since become the UK's second biggest regatta after Cowes Week when
a record armada of 289 boats head for Tarbert this evening to partcipate
in The Rover Series, but sadly, however, those boats which have perhaps
contributed most to the event's growth will not contest this opening
race.
The 30-plus smaller, fast, ultra lightweight boats of the
recession-beating new Sportboat class are deemed too unsafe for the
curtain-raising 100-mile offshore race which tonight musters at the twin
start lines of Gourock and Bangor, Northern Ireland, bound both for the
haven of Loch Fyne.
Instead, many forego the dubious pleasures of an overnight trip under
sail for the safety and comfort of a passage by road with their craft on
a trailer.
This sudden growth, fostered by a back-to-basics desire to sail faster
against similar small boats which require a minimal complement of crew
and maximum skill, marks a backlash against the financial excesses of
racing big expensive boats.
These 40 and 50-footers always suffered a built-in obsolesence due to
advances in design rules and technology. Sportboats such as the Melges
24, conceived by America's Cup winning starting helm Buddy Melges and
enjoying exponential growth in the USA, offer the chance to go sailing
with a crew of a four or five at speeds which 10 years ago would have
been enjoyed only by a boat twice its 24ft size, and three times its
#25,000 cost.
Accounting for the 10% increase on last year's entry, the Sportsboat
class -- one of 10 racing divisions at the Clyde Cruising Club-organised
event this year -- offers countrywide mobility cheaply. It is only these
new generation designs which have yielded any significant entries from
England's south coast.
Ten Melges 24s and 11 Slovenian built J &amp; J eight-metres will be the
core attraction in the Sportboat class which was set up last year.
Geoffrey Howison, who won in 1990, has brought his BHB 41 Local Hero X
from Australia to race in Class 0, while defending Rover Series holder
Alex Duffus will be racing in Class 1 in his meticulously prepared Sigma
400 Eclipse V.

LESS than a year after he joined Motherwell, Phil O'Donnell played in
the Tennents Scottish Cup final, scored a goal and collected a winner's
medal.
Less than a year after having joined Celtic for #1.7m, O'Donnell will
play in the Scottish Cup final, might well score a goal, and is in the
team that is odds-on to win the trophy.
It might just be that Celtic have bought a lucky omen as well as an
international player.
He reckons the pressure on him that afternoon in May, 1991, was
virtually non-existent, a different scenario from what will be the case
for him and every other Parkhead player as they attempt to win the first
major prize for the club in six years.
''I had played only 14 games for Motherwell when I was told on the
morning of the final that I was playing, and really, I was able to go
out and enjoy it. I'd like to think I could score a goal again, this
time for Celtic.''
He acknowledges that the fact that Celtic are expected to win will
make it much more of a mental as well as a physical test for his current
team, but he does not think his status as the club's costliest player
will worry him unduly.
O'Donnell, who keeps a level head on young shoulders, would like to
repeat the fun he had in that historic victory of the Lanarkshire team.
''I can remember everything about it, the build-up, how fantastic a game
it was, and the day itself. We were very relaxed. Motherwell had a great
bunch of lads at the time.''
He is certain the experience will benefit him when he trots on to the
same stage at Hampden again on Saturday, and perhaps the one lesson he
takes with him for this action replay is that the day is there to be
enjoyed.
One of the team-mates then who had a big influence was the late Davie
Cooper, whom O'Donnell says helped him a lot in his time at Motherwell.
''It is good to have memories of him from then, too.''
O'Donnell was absent from the Coca-Cola Cup final as he was
ineligible, but suffered along with the 40,000 other Celtic supporters
at Ibrox in November as his team were beaten in the penalty shoot-out by
Raith Rovers.
O'Donnell believes Celtic have played their best football in the cup
and reckons it might be simply because they knew each time there was
only one chance to succeed. He does not like talk, however, that
Celtic's name is on the trophy for this season. ''You can never say
that, but the fact that we played probably our best two games of the
season in the semi-finals against Hibs gave us a great lift.''
He agrees that the winning of the first trophy in such a long time
would have an enormous effect on everybody connected with Parkhead. ''It
would remove a lot of the pressure the players have felt here for four
or five years. I am only eight months here and I feel it myself. It is
also the first Scottish Cup final for many of the players.''
There is no cockiness in the O'Donnell make-up and it is no surprise
that he has a healthy respect for Airdrie, understandably, since he
played in the Motherwell team which was beaten 2-1 by them in the third
round of the Coca-Cola Cup last August.
''To be honest, I don't think it matters who you play in a final,
whether it is Rangers or a team from the third division. In the cup, it
can go any way on the day.
''Airdrie are expected to sit back, but when they beat us at
Motherwell they came out and had a go at us and played really well. I
think they are a good footballing team and they might come at us right
away.''
O'Donnell, who may have to undergo an operation on a troublesome groin
injury after the final, sums up his team-mates' task succinctly enough.
''We know what we have to do and it is up to us to go out and do it.''

HAGGS Castle veteran Jim McAlister took a large stride towards his
second consecutive victory at Blackwell yesterday with a two-under-par
68, which put him within one stroke of the lead in the Ben
Sayers/ProQuip Senior Club Professional championship.
The 56-year-old Scot, who captured the Scottish Seniors title at
Dalmahoy last Sunday, sits on the shoulders of pace-setters Tommy Horton
and David Butler at 139, one under par.
Sharing the lead on 138 are former European Tour player David Butler,
who excelled on the greens, and Tommy Horton, whose two-over-par 72 was
caused largely by finding the lake at the short ninth and taking
double-bogey 6. Leading aggregates:
138 -- D Butler (Coombe Wood) 70, 68; T Horton (Royal Jersey) 66, 72.
139 -- J McAlister (Haggs Castle) 71, 68.
140 -- T Squires (Boston) 68, 72.
143 -- J Johnson (Ipswich GC) 75, 68; B Huggett (unattached) 70, 73; D
Huish (North Berwick) 69, 74; D Craik (Frilford Heath) 71, 72; P Leonard
(Dunmurry) 69, 74.
144 -- R Browne (Laytown &amp; Bettystown) 71, 73; S Wilson (Trentham) 72,
72.
Other Scottish qualifiers: 149 -- G Will (London) 78, 71; J Hamilton
(Brickendon Grange) 73, 76; G Gray (Dumfries &amp; County) 73, 76; D Mills
(Crieff) 74, 75. 152 -- M Moir (Hamilton) 77, 75; S Murray (Hendon) 73,
79.
Scots who missed the cut: 154 -- A Gauld (Germany) 77, 77. 156 -- I
Smith (Hazlehead) 76, 80. 157 -- M McCrorie (Strathaven) 77, 80. 158 --
J Hume (Gullane) 77, 81. 165 -- J Steven (Glasgow) 83, 82.
* GARY Weir scooped the top two prizes in the Ben Shotgun Pro-Am at
Cardross yesterday, winning the individual prize by a stroke with a
three-under-par 68 in windy conditions and helping his playing partners
to the team prize.
He reached the turn in 34, one under par, and despite bogeying the
tenth he bagged three further birdies to deny John McTear pole position.
Leading scores:

<TEXT>
THE backlash has begun -- just as West Indies promised it would when
they flew in two weeks ago. Courtney Walsh and company gave England's
batsmen a smart cuff around the ear with a superbly-disciplined bowling
performance at Trent Bridge yesterday.
And when the rain-interrupted first Texaco Trophy international
resumes this morning, Brian Lara will be poised to put England firmly in
their place
The English total of 199 for nine looked a long way short as West
Indies reached 76 for the loss of Carl Hooper.
And with 35.1 overs remaining, another 124 runs should be within
range.
Their early tour form had indicated a team in decline following that
historic home Test series defeat by Australia. But yesterday's display
suggested a swift return to normal service -- and a whole heap of new
problems for England.
Apart from Alec Stewart and, briefly, Mark Ramprakash, no home batsman
threatened to break a West Indian stranglehold clamped on by Walsh, and
tightened by Ian Bishop.
Stewart top-scored with 74, Ramprakash made 32, but no other player
went beyond 15 as Walsh claimed three for 28 and Bishop -- appearing in
his first international for two years after a long fight against back
injuries -- returned figures of one for 30 in 11 overs.
The entire innings contained only twelve 4s -- 11 of them to Stewart
during his 127-ball stay -- and a solitary six, struck over long-on by
Ramprakash off the bowling of spinner Hooper.
Walsh started England's problems when having captain Mike Atherton
acrobatically caught at slip by Lara during the tenth over.
And Graeme Hick, Graham Thorpe, and Neil Fairbrother could not give
Stewart much support either as the home team struggled to get out of
first gear.
Hick and Thorpe both edged catches behind while Fairbrother's leg
stump was uprooted by a wicked in-swinger from Bishop.
And when Stewart was bowled by Hooper -- changing his mind after
initially intending to sweep -- England were struggling on 125 for five.
A combination of bad light and showers then interrupted West Indies'
progress towards their victory target.

Scotland 2, Ecuador 1
STEPHEN Crawford, who has had a fine season with Raith Rovers,
yesterday added another achievement to his credit when in Toyama, he
scored what proved to be the winning goal for Scotland against Ecuador
in his full international debut.
Crawford's strike with just seven minutes of the Kirin Cup match
remaining will not, however, earn him selection for the squad for next
month's European Championship qualifying tie against the Faroe Islands,
subject to the more experienced strikers being fit.
''It is a serious business in the Faroe Islands,'' said Scotland coach
Craig Brown, ''and although Crawford scored the winner, that will be a
job for experienced players.''
Crawford took the adulation which followed his first appearance for
the national side in his stride. He is aware that he still has much to
learn although it has to be said that this latest performance will do
nothing to dampen speculation over a move to Rangers.
''It was great to score for Raith Rovers when we beat Celtic in the
Coca-Cola Cup final,'' said Crawford, ''and to win the league this
season but things are just getting better for me and this tops it all so
far.''
The success was no less than the Scots deserved, although it has to be
said that Ecuador are not the strongest opposition they are likely to
meet.
In a forgettable first half Scotland should have taken the lead a
minute before the interval when Capurro gifted possession to Darren
Jackson close to his own penalty area, but the Hibs striker saw his shot
well saved by Cevallos.
Scotland pressed forward more frequently in the second half. Craig
Burley found Scot Gemmill inside the box after 51 minutes, but although
he beat Guaman, his powerful drive was blocked by the keeper.
Derek Whyte almost gave Scotland the lead in 65 minutes but his
first-time volley was palmed over by the Ecuador keeper. Cevallos was
busy frustrating Scotland again from a corner kick when Crawford, who
had just replaced Jackson, collected a loose ball and struck a low drive
towards goal.
The opening goal finally arrived with 15 minutes left. Scotland won a
corner on the right, Derek Whyte delivered to the near post, Crawford
tried to get a shot in but the ball broke kindly to John Robertson, and
he back-heeled it across the line from close in.
In 79 minutes Ecuador astonished everyone by equalising. Their goal
came courtesy of a penalty which was awarded when Brian Martin was
judged to have fouled Eduardo Hurtado, and Ivan Hurtado stepped up to
beat Jim Leighton with the minimum of fuss.
It was unfortunate for Leighton who did not have a save to make during
either of Scotland's two games in Japan.
Crawford then restored Scotland's advantage, swiftly dispossessing
Capurro and then exchanging passes with Burley before sending a low
drive beyond Cevallos from 12 yards.
That assured the Scots of their victory and now it is up to Japan to
beat Ecuador by a bigger scoreline if they are to deprive Craig Brown's
team of the trophy.

RANGERS last night were on the verge of signing Paul Gascoigne, who
emerged from seven hours of talks in London which resolved his
compensation claim from Lazio, but when the Ibrox club looked up from
transfer business they discovered that they remain quite a distance from
their main goal, Champions' League football.
UEFA revealed their seedings list for next season's Champions' League
and the premier division champions were frozen out, while English
champions Blackburn Rovers were seeded sixth, even though they have no
European pedigree at all.
The rankings will be an extreme disappointment to the Ibrox side, who
failed to beat AEK Athens in last year's prelims, but who are still the
only British side to have actually played with the elite in the
Champions' League. Blackburn fell at the first hurdle of last season's
UEFA Cup competition -- they lost to part-time side Trelleborgs -- but
are favoured by a system based on the size of a club's potential
television viewing audience.
The more cynical have always known England's champions would be seeded
because they have a large TV audience -- the most potent factor in
modern day football.
Indeed, all of the top eight seeds, the new defending champions Ajax
apart, represent countries with large populations. The Dutch club are in
as defending champions followed by Juventus, Nantes, Werder Bremen or
Borussia Dortmund, Real Madrid, Blackburn, Porto, and Spartak Moscow.
In the past clubs were able to take their own co-efficient -- points
earned through European appearances -- or that of their national
associations, depending on which was the higher. However, for next
season UEFA seem to be insisting that only the national co-efficients
will count, but any system which would have excluded Ajax had they not
beaten AC Milan in last night's European Cup final can only be regarded
as suspect.
Rangers can console themselves and galvanise their effort to win
through the August prelims and reach the Champions' League by completing
the signing of Gascoigne now that he has settled with Lazio. ''The
Gascoigne era with Lazio is over,'' said a spokesman for the Italian
club who have agreed a #4.5m fee with Rangers.
The 27-year-old is being pursued by Chelsea, Aston Villa, and Leeds
United, but Rangers chairman David Murray insisted yesterday that
Gascoigne would be signing for Rangers, and it seems he will do so
within a day or so after one or two more minor details have been
finalised.

Ajax 1, AC Milan 0
TWO teenagers, one Dutch, and one Nigerian, brought all the innocent
confidence of youth to bear in the European Cup Final in Vienna last
night.
And that was enough to give Ajax victory over the ageing stars of AC
Milan.
Patrick Kluivert, still just 18-years-old, scored the late goal for
the team from Amsterdam, which settled this final.
It arrived just six minutes from the end and the tall Dutchman raced
towards the touchline in triumph after he saw his low shot hit the net
Both he and Nwankwo Kanu, also 18, had been thrown into the game in
the second half by their coach, Louis Van Gaal, the man who discovered
them and has lovingly nurtured their talents.
Both youngsters made immense contributions. The lanky Kanu made life
uncomfortable for the formidable central defenders of Milan, Franco
Baresi and Alessandro Costacurta.
And Kluivert was able to make much more of an impact on the game than
Finnish ace Jari Litmanen, who had been shackled so successfully by the
close marking of Marcel Desailly.
The two teenagers brought fresh confidence to Ajax, something they had
been missing in the first half, especially as the game neared the
interval. In a spell then they found it hard to survive a period of
intense pressure from the Italians.
Marco Simone was desperately close to giving the Italians the lead,
and the game could have swung beyond the reach of the Dutch champions if
that had happened.
But Ajax held on and when the changes came in the second half they
began to display more and more of the glorious passing movements which
had been their trademark throughout this competition.
Kanu arrived on the scene first to replace another teenager, Clarence
Seedorf. That meant changes to the Ajax formation.
Van Gaal put Kanu up front, and pulled De Boer -- who almost scored
with a header -- back into midfield and suddenly Ajax began to take
control. Then, when Kluivert appeared after 67 minutes, there seemed to
be even more purpose to the Dutch side's play.
Earlier there had been suggestions of nervousness and at one stage it
looked as if the experience and resilience of Milan would win the day.
But Van Gaal had the courage of his convictions. He had emphasised
before the game the belief he had in his young players in the way they
played the game.
In the end it was their youth, and their self belief, and their skills
which carried the Dutch team to this triumph.
For Milan the game marks the end of an era when they dominated at home
and in Europe. They have already lost their domestic championship, now
they have also lost the Champions' Cup and next season they will play
among Europe's also-rans in the UEFA Cup.
The Italians had arrived in Vienna hoping to equal Real Madrid's
record of six wins in the tournament. That is now a memory and must wait
until the Italian giants regroup and rebuild.
Instead this could be the start of a period of domination by Ajax.
They will lose the influence of Frank Rijkaard who has said he will
retire from the game.
But they seem to have a never-ending supply of youngsters and those
who tasted victory last night will have a new maturity in their play
next season.
AJAX -- Van der Sar, Reiziger, Blind, Rijkaard, F De Boer, Ceedorf,
Finidi, Davids, R De Boer, Litmanen, Overmars. Substitutes -- Grim,
Bogarde, Kanu, Kluivert, van Vossn.
AC MILAN -- Rossi, Vanucci, Maldini, Albertini, Costacurta, Baresi,
Donadoni, Desailly, Massaro, Boban, Simone. Substitutes -- Ielpo, Galli,
Eranio, Lentini, Stroppa.
Referee -- I Craciunescu (Romania).

In South Africa
FRANCOIS Peinaar, the South African captain, stretches all 6ft 4in,
and 16[1/2] stones of himself in the warm autumn Cape Town sun.
It is the calm before the storm that will be the first game in this
1995 World Cup, and he has been taking his team's last few sessions as
they lie in wait like caged lions for the appetising encounter with
Michael Lynagh's Australia.
He says that the short tour to Scotland and Wales taught them much.
''We learned a lot, especially when we came up to your place, Scotland,
and came up against your rucking technique,'' he said ''We have studied
all of the videos of our games, and some of your club games, and we have
tried to take lessons from them all.''
In a well orchestrated campaign, the South Africans have been at pains
to portray themselves as underdogs and the Aussies as runaway favourites
for a match they say will need a super human effort.
But the pressure on Peinaar and his team is enormous, united as they
are under a slogan that portrays themselves as representing ''one team
-- one country.'' So much pressure that some players are saying that
they have not read a paper or watched the television for months to stay
concentrated on this one match.
However, their camp must have confidence as each press conference is
announced as ''the ninth of 52 press conferences -- if we reach the
final. ''There are, of course, political overtones to this game,'' says
Peinaar. ''But that is in a broader sphere. Previously we might have had
only two million people supporting us, but now we know that we have the
whole country, including blacks and coloureds, and that makes 40 million
people on our side. Therefore we have the slogan we have.''
He bullets forth points of information on the Australians that gives
an insight into the kind of preparation that his team has been through.
''We are ready. We know that Michael Lynagh has an average of 16.5
points per game, we know that the Australians have scored direct from
kick-offs three times recently, we know that in their last
international, David Campese, playing on the wing, still managed to
touch the ball 22 times in the game.''
He chews the words out with a tone that cannot hide respect. ''We also
know the threat posed by John Eales in the lineout. But we have our game
plan worked out. We have developed as a team. We think that we have a
more mobile pack, but their's is bigger. It will be interesting.''
The irreverent Campese has already given this game an edge. James
Small, the South African winger, missed the November tour because of
disciplinary measures after a night club ''incident'' in the coastal
resort of Port Elizabeth.
Small, born in Scotland, confided that the last time he met his
opponent, all the Australian wizard said to him was: ''Been in any night
clubs recently?'' before walking on into the night. There could be the
odd incident or two on the wing.
Bob Dwyer, the quiet Australian coach, says that it would be dangerous
to read everything into this one game against the hosts as, barring a
draw, one team has to win and it could be very close. Besides, there was
a long way to go.
''I agree with that,'' says Peinaar. ''Great minds think alike. If one
team wins, then so be it. It is not the end of the world, and it could
all be down to one mistake. There is no doubt that this will be a game
with big hits, but I do not think that there will be off-the-ball
problems. The kind of discipline I am concerned about is giving away
penalties for Lynagh to kick.''
The selection of Joel Stransky at inside centre has caused a deal of
eyebrow lifting in South Africa, many pundits saying that the stand-off
is out of position, but the South African management, including Peinaar,
disagree. ''We learned on the tour to Scotland the value of playing in
units, whereas before we had been playing a more individual style. Joel
is a fine player and will do well.''
Admirers of South African attire will be pleased to note that they
have not been allowed to wear the shoulder pads that even schoolboys
wear out here. ''No pads, that's all they said to us,'' says Peinaar.
''Just as well,'' said Michael Lynagh, ''because there would be no
sense, would there, in just one team wearing them.''
Just how far the South Africans have come since they rejoined world
rugby will be seen in this opening titanic game. They say they have a
plan should they go points down, or up.
Australia, though, with household names like Phil Kearns, Tim Gavin,
and John Eales have the greater experience on their side. Lynagh, for
instance, has more caps than the entire South African team. Whatever,
Cape Town will come to a stop when the action starts in Newlands.

THE opening ceremony for the Rugby World Cup in Cape Town today will
involve 1500 performers and include a welcoming speech by President
Nelson Mandela.
The ceremony will be staged immediately ahead of the opening match in
Cape Town between South Africa and the defending champions, Australia,
and will include all of the country's races and cultures.
''This is the time we want to show our new unified nation,'' said a
spokeswoman. ''The ceremony will reflect the host city and the host
country.''
Meanwhile, Scotland completed preparations for their opening match
against Ivory Coast at Rustenburg tomorrow with a private training
session at the Police Training College in Pretoria.
Today the Scots will stick to their usual pre-international schedule
with a light runaround for the public and media, but the hard graft has
now been completed.
Yesterday team manager Duncan Paterson was at pains to point out that
he expects the Ivory Coast side to be much more focused than that which
leaked almost a century of points against Northern Transvaal in a
warm-up game last month.
''People speaking about the number of points we will score against
them is just nonsense,'' he said. ''Look at it this way: on any Saturday
at Ibrox or Parkhead, Rangers or Celtic would have put 10 goals past
Costa Rica, but Scotland were unable to do that.
''We should put all this nonsense about the number of points we will
score into the background. Ivory Coast are playing for their country in
the World Cup and it's a completely different stage.''
The fringe players within the Scottish squad who have not made
tomorrow's side, or who are sitting on the bench, are obviously
disappointed that what may have been their best chance of getting an
early World Cup outing has passed.
The uncapped Cameron Glasgow, Edinburgh Academicals' Jeremy
Richardson, John Manson, who has been overlooked in favour of an
out-of-position Paul Burnell, and even Scott Hastings, who only makes
the bench, are cases in point.
However, Paterson said that following the selection meeting the
management had made it clear to the players that the 26-strong squad was
still of paramount importance.
''Everybody can't play and I am sure that everybody is mature enough
to realise that,'' he said. ''They are supporting the players who will
play on Friday. If we are going to win the World Cup then 100 per cent
undivided attention from everyone is vital. Nothing else will do.''
Ivory Coast fly-half Athanase Dali has been handed the the role of
captain against the Scots. Team:
V Kouassi; P Bouazo, J Sathicq, L Niakoiu, C N'Gbala; A Dali
(captain), F Dupont; A Ble, E Angoran, T Djehi, A Kone, G Bado, P Pere,
I Lassissi, D Sanoko.

South Africa,
THE South African government and the country's Rugby Football Union
are spending millions of rand on a development programme aimed at
attracting blacks to the traditionally Afrikaner dominated game of
rugby.
Earlier this week President Nelson Mandela issued a statement of
intent which made it clear that the Springboks, who open the Rugby World
Cup in Cape Town today against Australia, will never again field an
all-white side.
The South African squad, which lost its only black player, Chester
Williams, through an injury, is, said Mandela, the last of the
lily-whites.
''Many onlookers will be examining the composition of our country's
team and comments will touch on the lily-white nature of the side, when
other teams from Africa will be featuring people of colour,'' said
Mandela.
''I am advised by sports minister Steve Tshwete that this is the last
World Cup in which the majority of South Africans will not be
included.''
The injury-induced exclusion of Williams has come as a severe blow to
advocates of rugby for blacks. In Pretoria the face of Williams features
on advertising hoardings and in countless magazine advertisements, and
his late withdrawal means that a role model for millions of young blacks
has been denied his place on the world stage.
South Africa is a vast country with a population of nearly 43 million,
of whom 75% are black. Given those figures, Mandela's concern that the
black majority are not just under represented on the world rugby stage
but, since Williams' withdrawal, virtually invisible, is very real.
However, it is a concern mirrored by the rugby authorities in South
Africa. In an interview with The Herald, SARFU chief executive Edward
Griffiths revealed that 40% of the income derived from the World Cup --
in the region of #1m -- will be devoted to taking rugby to the black
townships.
''There are about 350,000 registered adult rugby players in the
country, of whom some 85-90,000 are non-white. Our aim is to redress
that balance so that the South African national side will, very soon,
reflect the true breakdown of the population,'' said Griffiths.
''Thirty per cent of our total income is geared towards redressing
that balance and 40% of the income from this World Cup will be directed
towards that aim as well.''
Griffiths added: ''Our aims are two-fold. As soon as possible we wish
to field a team that reflects the racial mix of the country, and
secondly we want to broaden the base of the game to ensure that rugby is
the true national sport of all South Africans.
''Throughout South Africa's recent history there have been huge
divisions and that is as true of rugby as it has been in the country at
large. We achieved unity within rugby -- with merger of the white and
non-white unions -- in 1992 and now we have to put that unity into
practice.
''This means that we have to achieve a degree of trust and do away
with the notion that rugby is an Afrikaner dominated game. It is a huge
challenge but it is one that we intend to achieve.''
The SARFU employs development officers in all of the 23 townships. In
all but the most reactionary areas the huge black population is seen as
an untapped source of raw rugby talent.
The township of Mamelodi, 20 kilometres south of Pretoria, is one area
where the rugby bug is beginning to bite. The rugby pitch serving 70,000
is a green oasis amid a desert of red dust and ramshackle homes.
Peter Maimane is coach to the Mamelodi Rugby Clinic. He has, like so
many of his township contemporaries, been unemployed since leaving
school.
Twice a week the Mamelodi clinic attracts nearly 200 youngers ranging
in age from eight to 19.
Maimane, who plays for the (white) Pretoria club, Eerstrust, and who
also has played for the Northern Transvaal President's XV and NT
under-23, says: ''In the last two years we have built this up from
nothing.
''It is difficult to get boys to come along. Football is the big sport
in Mamelodi. The most difficult thing was getting the pitch. The boys
can play football anywhere, but without a grass pitch, which was built
by the Pretoria City Council, you cannot play rugby.''
Maimane says that despite the efforts of themselves and the Northern
Transvaal Rugby Academy, the game still is seen by many older blacks as
the sport of the Afrikaner.
''They still look at rugby as a game for whites but, more and more,
there are people like me who see it as a game for everyone.''

Wales will be keen to bounce back after a Five Nations' wooden spoon.
Ian Gordon examines how a captaincy change may hold the key.
ASK any Cardiff supporter the reason behind the club's three-year rise
from near-relegation to Heineken League champions and the answer will
always invariably be: Alex Evans.
But ask Evans himself and the highly-respected Australian is in no
doubt about the importance of Mike Hall in Cardiff's re-emergence as the
top team in Wales.
''What we have achieved at Cardiff would not have been possible
without Mike Hall as captain,'' said Evans of the man whose reign as
skipper has run tandem with his tenure as coach.
''His part in the revival of the club cannot be overestimated,'' added
Evans of Hall, who guided the club to their first league title this
season after their SWALEC Cup triumph last year.
It was inevitable then that when Evans was asked to come to Wales'
World Cup rescue following the departure of the entire management team,
his shake-up would involve Hall taking over as captain of the national
side.
Thus, barring injury, the 29-year-old self-employed property
consultant will win his 40th cap when he leads his country for the first
time in the opening group game against Japan in South Africa later this
month.
The decision did not meet with unanimous approval in Wales -- but that
was partly down to the universal popularity of record-breaking skipper
Ieuan Evans.
With Hall -- who made his Wales debut on the ill-fated 1988 tour to
New Zealand as a replacement in the first Test -- there is no half-way.
People either like him or dislike him.
''Mike is one of those people who is not afraid to speak his mind,''
added Evans.
''That does not endear him to some. Some people do have it in for him
because of his outspoken views.
''But when there was all the doubt surrounding the future of the Welsh
management team, it was Mike the other players were ringing to find out
what was going on.
''He has got that aura about him and is a natural leader of men.''
Hall's playing pedigree is sound enough: skipper of Wales Under-21's,
a double blue with Cambridge University and a British Lion from the 1989
tour to Australia, when he played in the first Test.
That record though, did not stop his fellow players, plus the coaches
and team managers of the first division clubs overlooking him when the
All Star team was announced last week.
Critics have put a question mark over his ability as a top-class
international and doubt whether he will be revered in the same way as
his legendary predecessors in the centre's jersey.
Again Evans is quick to jump to the defence of his captain, who trod
the well-worn path from Maesteg -- stopping off at Bridgend along the
way -- to the Arms Park.
''Give Mike Hall quick ball and he will make the break for you,'' said
Evans. ''He has the ability and the awareness to give his backs plenty
of options, but quick ball is not something he has always had with
Wales.
''As an outside centre, I rank him as one of the best in Britain, if
not the world.''

Who will enthral the globe by strutting their stuff on the high veldt?
Derek Douglas looks at the men most likely to succeed.
THE eyes of the rugby world will be focused on the high veldt of South
Africa for the next four weeks when over 400 of the oval globe's top
players will have the chance to strut their stuff on the world stage.
The jamboree of rugby will provide a platform for just a handful to
grab the imagination of the watching public and to take the competition
by storm. The Herald puts half a dozen potential stars under the
spotlight: Six to be Great.
TIM RODBER (England)
Club: Northampton
Height: 6ft 6ins
Weight: 16st 7lbs
Position: Flanker
TIMOTHY Andrew Keith Rodber looks like he has arrived in the England
side via Central Casting. Tall and lean, with Teutonically chiselled
features, he appears every inch the Army captain that he is.
He is also, say the wiseacres, captain-in-waiting to the England team
as well. Once the Old Farts have had their final revenge or when Will
Carling retires, Rodders is ready to pick up the captain's
responsibilities.
He is a player of awesome power, but it is not all matinee idol stuff.
Last summer he became only the second Englishman to be sent off after
a bout of fisticuffs during England's South African tour.
Rodber has the build and the athleticism to shine in South Africa and
he will be one of England's key men.
CRAIG JOINER (Scotland)
Club: Melrose
Position: Right wing
Height: 5ft 10ins
Weight: 13st 12lbs
THE other Glimmer Twin. Young ''Jackie'' Joiner has grown in
confidence with each game for Scotland this season.
He came into the side against Canada in January after Tony Stanger had
been recalled for the pre-Christmas game against the Springboks.
Joiner, a Scottish Schools sprint star, made his Scotland debut on the
ill-fated tour to Argentina when both Tests were lost.
He looked ill-at-ease in his first few outings and has admitted that
his greatest fear was that the selecors would twist the reluctant winger
Stanger's arm once again. But he has rewarded selectorial faith --
particularly after the French game when both tries came down his wing --
with some polished performances and on the warm-up tour to Spain he
scored back-to-back hat-tricks. His is a major talent just waiting to
bloom in all its glory.
KENNY LOGAN (Scotland)
Club: Stirling County
Position: Left wing
Height: 6ft 1ins
Weight: 13st 8lbs
One half of Scottish rugby's Glimmer Twins - the other being right
winger Craig Joiner - Kenneth McKerrow Logan possesses the buzz factor
in abundance. The buzz factor? That's the conditions which grips
spectators whenever Logan has the ball.
Throughout the Five Nations' tournament Logan looked the man most
likely to score. He played a leading role in Eric Peters' barnstroming
effort against Wales but, quite contrarily, the final touchdown seemed
always to evade the cheery Bridgehaugh man.
He added to his single Scotland try - scored during last summer's tour
to Argentina - with a touchline try against Romania in April. He was
among the tries again during the warm-up tour to Spain.
There are still a heap of tries to come from young Ken. South Africa
would be the place to really turn on the try-scoring tap.
DAVID CAMPESE (Australia)
Club: Randwick
Position: Wing/full back
Height: 5ft 10ins
Weight: 13st 5 lbs
WHAT can one say about Campo that he hasn't already said himself.
Rugby's first world superstar, Campese possesses mercurial talent and an
unrivalled capacity to shoot from the lip, his most recent salvo being
directed at recuperating Wallaby teamate Tim Horan who Campese reckons
isnt fit enough to deserve his place in the Oz World Cup party.
Campese was player of the tournament at the 1991 World Cup after which
he announced his retirement. I was there. I heard him. But I didn't
believe him.
Campese may be 33 but there is still at least one good World Cup in
him.
He will revel in the conditions in South Africa and you can be
guaranteed that before the tournament is over there will have been at
least one crazy Campo stunt on the sidelines. This, surely, is his last
hance to shine on the world stage. David Ian Campese will want to go out
with a roar.
JOOST VAN DER WESTHUIZEN
Province: Northern Transvaal
Position: Scrum-half
Height: 6ft 2ins
Weight: 13st 9lbs
JOOST Van der Westhuizen scored four tries on his Springbok debut
against Western Australia in 1993 and his name has rarely been off the
scoresheet since.
Despite not making the Test side the unlikely looking scrum-half
returned home from Australia with 11 touchdowns making him the tour's
top scorer.
That same year he toured Argentina, where he made his Test debut, and
scored a try in each Test victory.
Scottish audiences will need no reminding of his uncanny knack of
finding the try line. Remember the audacious blindside touchdown from a
scrummage which left the Scottish defence high and dry? Then the try
which he conjured from nothing as he ran through a ruck and grounded the
ball without a Scottish hand being laid on him?
Van der Westhuizen has within him the capacity to become one of the
world'g great scrum halves. Where better to do that that in front of his
''ain volk'' on the high veldt in South Africa.
SIMON GEOGHEGAN
Club: Bath
Height: 6ft 1ins
Weight: 13st
Position: Wing
THE misguided missile running style of Simon Patrick Geoghegan has
been likened to that of Bambi on Benzedrine or to the unpredictability
of a wounded antelope.
With the ball in hand he oozes class and charisma but gives coaches a
season ticket pass to the coronary-care unit. He is not so clever in
defence but then, what the hell, wingers are there to score tries.
Aren't they?
A trainee solicitor and now with the West Country champs Bath, as
opposed to London Irish, Geoghegan has come back to form just in time
for the RWC. How Ireland will do is anybody's guess. As they say in
these parts, the state of Irish rugby is hopeless but never serious.
Nevertheless, there is little doubt that Geoghegan will, one way or
another, make his mark irrespective of how the bhoyos in green are
faring.
A coach once said of Geoghegan: ''When you take on Simon you take on
extra baggage and when you do so you have to appreciate that there is a
very fine dividing line between genius and madness.''
All Ireland trusts the genius will be on parade in SA.

ROB Egerton's international career must be one of the most short-lived
and successful. He played eight matches on Australia's left wing in 1991
and won seven times including his last match, the World Cup final v
England at Twickenham.
ONLY four players have played in the maximum possible 12 World Cup
finals matches; David Campese and Michael Lynagh of Australia and Sean
Fitzpatrick and Gary Whetton of New Zealand. With the first three all
again selected, what price their joint-record being extended to 18?
GAVIN Hastings' world record 27 points v Romania on June 2, 1987 was
the source of much frustration for many journalists. After faithfully
recording the great man's words in the written, audio and visual forms,
Didier Camberabero popped up a couple of hours later with a new record
rendering much painstaking work useless.
FRANCK Mesnel, who has played nine World Cup matches for France,
enjoys the lighter side of the sprot particularly with his team Racing
Club de Paris. It was Franck who started 'Showbiz,' a club within a
club, dedicated dto bringing a smile to everyones lips. Indeed, in the
French showpiece Club Final, he encouraged several team mates to wear
berets, bow ties and outlandish baggy shorts.
ABDELATIF Benazzi played in three Wrold Cup matches for Frnace in 1991
but his iinternational career got off to a dmost inauspicious start in
1990 when he was sent off after 14 minute sof his debut match against
Australia.
THE 1987 tournament saw the most prolific scoring with 1621 points and
224 tries at an average of seven per match. The finalists, New Zealand
and France, were responsible for 77 tries and 513 points.
IN 1958 the International Rugby Board was so fearful of the prospect
of a rugby union World Cup that they actually forbade member nations
meeting to discuss such a possibility.
EWAN MacMillan's first cap for Zimbabwe v Scotland at Murrayfield was
a very special moment for the MacMillan household. Ewan's parents had
emigrated to Zimbabwe from Perth in the 1960s.
DIEGO Dominguez (Italy) may not have scored the most points (29) in
1991, but he was the most accurate kicker landing seven out of seven
conversions and five out of six penalties for an impressive 92% return.
DAVID Milne, the self-confessed 'black sheep' of the family, joined
the flock when he won his only Scotland cap v Japan as a replacement for
David Sole alongside younger brother Kenny. If older brother Iain had
been fit all three 'Bears' would have packed down together.
FOUR players have incurred the wrath of referees in the first two
World Cups and have been ordered off. Huw Richards (Wales) has the
dubious distinction of being first in the early bath, followed by David
Codey (Australia) also in 1987 and Matt Keenan (Western Samoa) and Pedro
Sporleder (Argentina) walked together at Pontypridd in 1991.
IN the two World Cups to date a grand total of 2818 points have been
scored in 64 matches, including 361 tries.
Fact file extra
MICHAEL Jones' firm religious convictions prevented him from playing
against Wales on a Sunday in the 1987 Cup, and caused him to miss three
matches in 1991, including the crucial semi-final. It is rumoured that
the dynamic flanker's exclusion from this year's All Black squad is
partly due to his devotion to God.
'ENTHUSIASTIC' beginners? Ivory Coast's qualifying match for the 1991
competition against Morocco in Harare was so violent that the match was
abandoned 10 minutes from time because of fighting.
SEEING double double? It was unusual enough when twins Gary and Alan
Whetton played together throughout the victorious All Black's 1987
campaign. However, when the Whetton's lined up against Italy in 1991
they faced the Cuttita twins --Marcello and Massimo.
GRAEME Bachop has been a stalwart member of the All Black set up since
1989. However, his brother Steve opted to represent Western Samoa in the
1991 tournament. It is just as well the two countries did not meet as
their friends and realtions loyalties would have ben sorely tested.
THE 16 nations who played in the first competition were chosen by the
IRB with the established rugby playing nations (excepting South Africa)
being joined by representatives from North America, South America,
Europe, Asia, the Pacific and Africa.
BRIAN Smith won six caps for Australia as a scrum half and scored two
tries against Ireland in the 1987 World Cup. Two years later, Smith had
not only changed position -- to stand off -- but he had changed
nationality after discovering an Irish granny, winning nine caps for the
Emerald Isle before defecting to rugby league.
SCOTTISH referee Jim Fleming has a habit of being involved in the big
occasion. He was a touch judge in the first-ever match in the World Cup
between New Zealand and Italy and refereed the first match of 1991
between England and New Zealand. What next? The final?

The pressure on South Africa has cost two coaches their jobs since
1992.Anton Ferreira looks at what the future may hold for new coach
Kitch Christie, below.
AFTER a faltering return to world rugby less than three years ago,
hosts South Africa have convinced a growing number of people they
deserve their status as joint World Cup favourites.
A crushing 60-8 victory over the South Sea islanders of Western Samoa
on April 13 in their final warm-up test before the tournament underlined
Springbok determination to secure rugby's biggest prize and made even
impartial observers sit up.
''The team looks very good, very fit, and they are very serious
contenders for the World Cup,'' said former Argentine fly half Hugo
Porta, who now serves as his country's ambassador to Pretoria.
''The match against Western Samoa showed the team have the strength to
beat anyone in the world.''
The Springboks, listed alongside defending champions Australia in the
pre-tournament betting, scored nine tries in an impressive display of
the running rugby which new coach Kitch Christie favours.
Christie is the third national coach since South Africa returned to
international competition in August 1992, a by-product of the upheaval
in Springbok rugby caused by a decade of apartheid isolation.
The country's rugby fans were plunged into depression when South
Africa went down to New Zealand and Australia on successive Saturdays
and, later that same year, lost to England and drew 1-1 in a series
against France.
South Africa had failed to keep up with the new laws and adapt to a
whole new style of play and it was only last year that the team began to
find their feet and play with some consistency.
They drew a home series with England 1-1, then hit their stride on a
victorious tour of Wales, Scotland, and Ireland which established them
as potential winners of the first World Cup they have been free to
enter.
Several Springboks emerged as world class players during that tour,
among them full back Andre Joubert, black winger Chester Williams, and
lock Mark Andrews.
''We've got a lot of talent but you need superstars,'' said former
Springbok captain Naas Botha. ''Andrews is one.''
The Natal lock has played a key role in strengthening the line-out,
one of the areas in which the Springboks struggled most on their return
to world competition.
South Africa could not ask for a tougher match to kick off the World
Cup when they meet Australia in Cape Town on May 25. In 1992, Australia
beat them on the same Newlands pitch 26-3.
If the Springboks beat Australia they are likely to finish top of
their pool and have an easier route to the final.
But if they lose that first match, they face the unpleasant prospect
of having to beat England in the quarter finals and New Zealand in the
semis.
''We've got to have at least a 51% chance against Australia,'' said
Botha.
''It's home field advantage. I know they are coming here to win the
first game because David (Campese) said the other day if they can win
the first one, they'll be in the final.
''That's their attitude. Let's change it, let's make it our attitude,
let's win the first game and get into the final.''
South Africa have experimented with around 70 national players in the
last three years but now appear to have found the core of a winning
team.
However, doubts remain over the fly half slot with Hennie le Roux of
Transvaal and Joel Stransky of Western Province competing to fill the
gap.
Le Roux, an explosive runner, fits Christie's style of play but was
picked at centre against Western Samoa. Stransky, a strategic kicker,
played at fly half and impressed with his touch-finders.
Botha, a master of the boot who has been coaching South Africa's
alarmingly erratic place-kickers, said Stransky might be the best choice
for the opening match.
''We'll have to get ourselves out of trouble and we're not going to do
that by running. We're not going to score against Australia from our own
22.
''We have to get into their half and put the pressure on them and then
try and score from there. Stransky. . . might be the surprise package.''
Botha said the test against Wester Samoa could give the Springboks a
great deal of confidence for the opener. Australia beat the islanders
75-3 last year.
The Super 10 competition earlier this year -- won by Queensland in a
close-fought final against Transvaal -- also provided a yardstick to
compare South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand:
''The Super 10 final showed Australia will also be serious contenders,
Porta said. ''The Australians' defence was very good, they were under a
lot of pressure but they did not concede penalties.''
Unfortunately, winger Chester Williams will miss the tournament
because of injury. His cutting edge and incisive pace will be sorely
missed.

BEWARE Tonga. The King has spoken. That has to be one warning to
Scotland's World Cup squad as they prepare to measure their status in
South Africa against the heavyweights of the world game.
It is a dangerous assumption that all Scotland have to do is win their
final group match against France so that they may then take on Wales or
Ireland rather than New Zealand in the quarter-finals.
True enough Scotland should have too much experience for the Ivory
Coast who have been playing internationals only since 1990 and can boast
only 15 clubs and 2700 players.
Tonga could offer a much stronger challenge. They have been roundly
criticised and given a royal boot on their ample backsides by none other
than King Taufa Ahua Topou IV himself.
He was so disgusted with his countrymen when they were thrashed 75-5
by Canterbury in the Super Ten series that he ordered the coaches to
ensure that smoking and drinking by players ceased, so that a much
higher standard of fitness could be sought. He even arranged for a
scrummage machine to be purchased and for New Zealand advisors to be
introduced.
For this World Cup Tongan expatriates in Australia and New Zealand
have been invited into their squad. Thus their two heaviest forwards
Felamani Mafi (19st 2lb) and Etuiri Talakai (19st 3lb) play their rugby
in Canberra and Auckland respectively.
The King's admonition seemed to have the desired effect in that the
last Super Ten match against mighty Auckland was lost by only 25-37,
four tries to five.
So Scotland will face a fitter and more focused Tongan side not to
mention their intimidatory style of ribcage tackling that has been
referred to as ''the Tongan charge''.
The Ivory Coast squad also contains some extremely bulky citizens such
as the 31-year-old prop Jean-Pascal Ezoua who is over 19 stone, and
another prop Ernest Bley who is 18 stone. They have been at high
altitude training near Poitiers in France and whilst there they beat two
club sides, Angouleme (29-15) and La Teste (23-7). They also had sent
their captain, Anastase Dali to the France v Scotland game in Paris and
to one French training session to size up their World Cup opposition.
Of course it would be a dreadful setback, although not necessarily
fatal, if Scotland were to fall to the Ivory Coast or Tonga. There is
something of a dilemma for the tour selectors in whether to play the
strongest side in all three games to ensure qualification, or simply in
the first against the Ivory Coast and the third against France and give
some to the key men a rest from the Tonga game.
Certainly the heavy cannon will be needed for the French match. Pierre
Berbizier and his charges know that their restless and ever-demanding
public will judge them harshly on World Cup outcome. France expects,
especially following their disappointing Five Nations' campaign, and
South African conditions should be to their liking.
Whether Berbizier now has the right blend at half-back, considering
the injury withdrawal of Christophe Deylaud who set a points record in
the recent cup final, remains to be seen. However, the rest of his
outfit looks very strong and they would relish revenge against Scotland.
The Scots, however, have evolved a style this season that should
prosper in the firm running conditions they should encounter at
Rustenburg and in Pretoria. Keeping the ball alive, moving it wide and
picking time and place to run from the deep are now higher on the
agenda. That surely has been the most heartening feature of Scotland's
resurgence in that their wider choice of attack method renders them less
predictable.
The stage will be set also for Scots to demonstrate that they can look
the big boys straight in the eye, hopefully not least in providing
opportunities for their wings, Craig Joiner, Kenny Logan and Cameron
Glasgow and, in emergency, Tony Stanger to demonstrate that amalgam of
pace, power and jinkiness they have on offer.
Craig Chalmers will be a key figure in option choice and one barely
can wait to see Scotland's big, dynamic loose forwards creating their
impact, although the success of their endeavours will rest heavily on
whether Scotland's tight forwards can stay upsides in ball provision. Of
course, there is the skipper himself whom everyone hopes will have a
farewell for the record books.
Of some concern, however, has to be whether all the players will
accommodate quickly enough to training and playing at 5000ft above sea
level. No stone has been left unturned by the management to ensure that
Scotland will peak for this great event, and the recent spell in Spain
was a vital part of acclimatisation.
Yet Derrick Patterson, who played in South Africa two years ago, found
that the adverse effect on breathing and legs was greater on the veldt
than in Spain. The Scots also will have to accommodate to higher bounces
and to the ball travelling further through the thin air.
All of which underlines the considerable task of striking rich form in
unfamiliar environment and of taking one game at a time, dealing with
first things first, in a venture that hopefully will seal Scotland's
high standing in the world order.

When John Beattie was but a cub, he went on a Lions' tour . . .
fifteen years on he reminisces with his skipper.
MY first Lions tour was fifteen years ago, almost to the day, to South
Africa. Among the jolly band of young Britons that made up the party,
including Tony Ward, Graham Price, Peter Wheeler and Jim Renwick, one
man stood head and shoulders above the rest and that was the captain,
Bill Beaumont.
Frankly, I was a little star-struck in them days, what with having to
put Graham Price to bed on the very first night of the tour, and being
given the job of keeping people like Fran Cotton and Ray Gravell on
time.
Gravell, now what a boy that was, I can tell you. Film star? He always
was doing something in his own film. But my biggest hero, was, of
course, Beaumont the Lancastrian -- in the land of the Boer.
Let me tell you that Bill Beaumont bears little real resemblance to
the avuncular figure that graces A Question of Sport. Little
resemblance, that is, save for his intelligence.
Beaumont, was, of his day, as good a second row as could be found in
the world, and a man that received respect from every person he played
with and against, no matter the country. Hard he was.
''We lost the series three-one, when we could have won every game,''
says Beaumont.
''But what I remember is the same feeling, no doubt, as every rugby
player gets when he sees South Africa, and that is of being hugely
impressed by the rugby facilities, and no doubt they have even improved
since then, and noticing that they were far better than anything that I
had ever seen in my life in any country.''
Beaumont had already been to New Zealand with the Lions.
''I also remember the size of the players, the amazing difference
between playing down at sea level in Durban or Capetown compared to the
high veldt, and I remember that they were the best playing conditions in
the world. Perfect rugby conditions. If you can't play good rugby in
South Africa, then you can't play it at all.''
Back in 1980, it was hard not to be impressed by the world's biggest
man made hole -- the mile deep Kimberly diamond mine -- and the beaches,
the sharks, the dolphins, the wildebeest, and the mountains, and the
vast beautiful expanse of it all. It was a young man's dream.
But it was a nightmare when you stopped to shudder at a political
system that genuinely believed that people with black skins were
inferior, unable to use the same toilets, and were banished to squalid
shanty towns.
But that, they say, has changed.
''Back then the South Africans had a sense of being shunned by the
rest of the world,'' says Beaumont. ''Now there is a sense of them
having been brought back from isolation, and you feel that they are
desperate to show off their beautiful country to the world's media.
''I felt when we played them in the past that they were friendly off
the pitch, but they played with a sense of having to prove that they
were the best on the pitch. Out of resentment. Now I think that their PR
will be getting into gear in a big way.''
Add to that the fact that their country, rugby mad to the ultimate
degree, is actually hosting the World Cup at the same time, and Beaumont
can picture clearly the result on your average South African.
''Everything that is happening in South Africa will pale by comparison
to the World Cup,'' he says. ''It will be like VE Day, the FA Cup, and
all the rest rolled into one. For the first time since New Zealand in
1987, the Rugby World Cup is going to a true rugby country.''
Perhaps it took an unwitting Englishman -- Will Carling -- to show
that player power is on the increase in world rugby, but Beaumont says
that one of the by-products of this summer's competition is that the
days of amateurism will soon be gone.
''Rugby will never be the same again, and it is inevitable that the
game will go professional in one way or another very soon. There's no
doubt also that Lions' tours are now a thing of the past, even though
the authorities are said to be organising another one.''
Beaumont says that the World Cups are now much more attractive than
Lions' tours. ''The significance just isn't there in Lions' tours
compared to World Cups any more,'' he adds. ''When I played in Lions'
tours they were the pinnacle of every player's career.
''Now it is the ambition of all of the players to take part in a World
Cup. I can see the point too. I would have loved to have played in a
World Cup. This one in particular.''
And so would I. Of all the places I have seen in my life, and I was a
little boy born in the jungle of Borneo after all, South Africa was
something different alright.
It was huge. The men were huge, the women were even bigger, and the
place was as pretty as a picture. It varied from high culture,
civilisation and wine growing in the south, to racism, rednecks and
rough houses in the north.
We stumbled as a group from Brai (barbecue to you and me) to Brai, ate
steak till it popped out of our ears, swam, trained, lolled about,
played rugby, and generally did all the things that groups of young men
stuck together for long periods of time did.
Well, we did in those days anyway. It was paradise, your honour.
It will be too for the current generation as they battle to do their
best in the land of rugby. So which of them will win then?
''I don't think that there will be too many upsets,'' admits Beaumont.
''The big sides have proved that if you get the ball then you win games.
One problem may be refereeing and consistency in interperetation, but I
expect the favourites will do well.''
And who might they be then? ''I think it will be between South Africa,
New Zealand, Australia. . . and England.'' There. Thought you might say
that.
Beaumont, a decent man who remembers a great country, always was a
patriot.

Paying tribute to a stalwart of stadium and screen who has defeated
serious illness.
CHRIS Rea gives the impression he is enjoying every minute of his
life. . . and it is not an act. Three years ago, still short of his 50th
birthday, he was given just a 5% chance of recovering from cancer of the
bowel and liver.
''They told my wife she would have to face the strong possibility that
I would be gone within the year,' he recalls. ''Thankfully, after some
superb medical treatment and the whole-hearted backing of my family, I
have come through it.
''There is no sign of the disease and I am feeling fitter than ever.
But it does put matters into some kind of true perspective.'' Yes,
indeed.
Chris Rea will be popping up on your television screens as one of the
ITV team of commentators in the World Cup. He will be paying particular
attention to Scotland's group, as well he might, for this is a man with
13 caps and someone with a very special place in Scottish rugby history.
For it was the Dundonian Rea, a sizzling centre with West of Scotland
and Headingley, who set up the best moment at Twickenham since the
Second World War. In 1971, with the final seconds ticking away on the
referee's wrist, Chris scored a try to bring the Scots within a point of
the English at 14-15.
Then, as every Galashiels' boy learns at his mother's knee, up stepped
Peter ''PC'' Brown to kick the vital conversion. It was Scotland's first
victory at the headquarters of English rugby since Wilson Shaw's match
in 1938.
''What was even more remarkable,'' Chris remembers, ''was that we beat
them again the follwing week at Murrayfield -- the score was 26-6 this
time -- in a match played to celebrate the centenary of first
international between the countries. And we were eight points up before
the kick-off time!''
Welsh referee Merion Joseph, for reasons best known to himself,
allowed the game to start three minutes early. Gala's Jock Turner kicked
off and England full-back Bob Hiller fielded the ball near the
right-hand corner flag. Everyone waited for his to boot it straight into
touch.
Instead he passsed to his threequarter colleague Jeremy Janion who,
infected by the madness, continued the handling spree in his own 22.
Unfortunately, when the ball reached winger John Spencer he promptly put
it on the ground.
Up thundered another of Gala's finest, John Frame, picked up and dived
over for a try. Just 12 seconds had elapsed.
Peter Brown converted and, almost immediately afterwards, kicked a
penalty goal. It was still not three o'clock. ''I did particularly enjoy
that match,'' admits Rea today.
When he retired as a player, Chris soon gravitated towards the media,
first joining the BBC as an administrator, later becoming a well-known
broadcaster covering both rugby and golf. The latter provided him with
several priceless moments on air.
''Yes, I spent much of my time whispering in those days. The equipment
was much less sophisticated and I was always the guy trying to see and
record what was going on among the crowd at the back of the green.
Sometimes my muttering would be heard by the players.
''Among the nastiest looks I received was from former Open champion
Johnny Miller, while the Nick Faldo glower, which has also come my way,
certainly puts you in your place.
''But the last Open Championship to be played at Carnoustie was quite
unforgettable. I was interviewing -- live, of course -- the wife of the
Australian golfer Jack Newton, who was a lovely lady called Jackie. We
had started the chat with my sound man, who had a backpack strapped on,
holding the microphone and all seemed to be going well. Suddenly, a
little tractor-type vehicle hoved into sight, clipped my chap on the
back of his leg and he disappeared down a mound, having let out the most
fearful obscenity which was heard throughout the land.
''Mrs Newton and I just had to stand there, trying to control our
mirth. Des Lynam, who was working on television at the time, told
viewers that they never knew what the radio boys would get up to next.''
As for his rugby broadcasting memories, Chris still ruefully recalls
Gavin Hastings' international debut against France at Murrayfield in
1986. ''That was when he kicked the ball straight out right from the
start. We all waited for the French to trot back to the half-way line
and claim a scrum. Then little Pierre Berbizier took a quick throw-in,
his forwards and backs shot to the other end and scored. Most of the
Scots hadn't a clue what had happened.
''Nor had most of the media, including yours truly. In all my years in
rugby, I had never heard of this law. I was left quite speechless which
is not the best thing to be on radio. Needless to say, Gav went on to be
the match-winner.''
On television Chris was the regular presenter of the national edition
of Rugby Special -- until this season. The BBC, for whom he had worked
for 25 years, then replaced him with John Inverdale. Does that explain
the switch of channels to ITV?
''Not entirely. I had no contract with the BBC and they had every
right to act as they did. There is no bitterness on my part: indeed,
since the Rugby Special decision I have done quite a lot of work for
them on both radio and television. I even have a current radio series
looking at some of the sports which do not always have the coverage
their numbers deserve.
''But when ITV came on the line to offer the World Cup chance I just
had to consider it. I have to admit I am as excited about the prospect
as I was about my first broadcast.
''I hope to go on working with the BBC in future but this is a special
opportunity given to few. I decided I should not waste it.''
Rea, as distinguished a writer as he is a broadcaster, has recorded
his view that Australia must start favourites to retain the trophy they
won four years ago. South Africa, he feels, will be the side presenting
the greatest danger. ''There is a perfectly arguably scenario in which
the Springboks lose the opening match to the champions but still go on
to win the championship.
''I still find it difficult to write off the All Blacks while France
can be brilliant or just bloody awful.''
What of Scotland, we required to know? ''I have hopes, I put it no
stronger than that, of the Scots going as far as they did the last time,
reaching the semi-finals. That would be a magnificent achievement and a
wonderful finale to the career of Gavin Hastings.
''This is, in fact, the first World Cup in which I will be employed as
a commentator rather than a studio pundit. I am going to enjoy it. . .
not least because I am just delighted to be here.'' All his friends, and
I count myself among them, want Chris Rea to be covering World Cups for
many years to come.

Recent heavy defeats have sent Western Samoa back to the drawing
board. Chris Peteru finds a side keen to repeat their 1991 World Cup
adventure.
WORLD Cup success has proved both a blessing and a burden for Western
Samoa.
The Western Samoans' 16-13 win over Wales at Cardiff Arms Park in 1991
provided the sensation of the tournament and propelled the South Sea
islanders to the quarter-finals.
It also heightened the profile of the game ideally suited to a robust,
physical people and, as in many small countries, success in sport has
provided consolations for economic problems.
But the downside has been a steady stream of defections, both to the
New Zealand All Blacks and to professional rugby league.
Among those lured away have been Frank Bunce, Stephen Bachop, Alama
Ieremia and Ofisa Tonuu to the All Blacks, while Apollo Perelini and
Lolani Koko have switched to league.
Western Samoa's latest international adventures will also not have
inspired confidence for the World Cup starting in South Africa next
month.
They lost 73-3 to Australia in Sydney last year, albeit after a series
of injuries which made it impossible for the side to hold a team run
before the game.
Then last Thursday the Samoans went down 60-8 to South Africa at
Johannesburg's Ellis Park in the final game of a five-match tour.
They have also been drawn in one of the tougher groups, with Five
Nations' champions England, Argentina and Italy, a source of obvious
concern to coach Peter Schuster.
''Having already played Argentina, we have an idea of what to
expect,'' Schuster said.
''Italy are big players with strong physiques who have an excellent
kicker, so we can't afford to give away any penalties. On top of that
they were very competitive against Australia in the test last year and
we weren't.
''Even though we were undefeated in the Aussie tour, the Test I think
has made us look like underdogs, but we don't mind that.
''Although we respect our opponents, the World Cup is about playing
one game at a time and playing hard for 80 minutes.''
One immediate result of the Australian defeat was to send the Western
Samoan management back to fundamentals.
''We want fast mobile forwards who are not going to turn the ball
over. Now we are going to try and take teams on up front, because the
side without the ball usually gets frustrated first,'' said Schuster.
He immediately ordered a weight training programme for the entire side
and warned that any player who failed a fitness test would be dropped.
Test lock Mataafa Keenan wa unceremoniously dumped, and even veteran
skipper Peter Fatilaofa was ordered to shape up.
Fatilaofa, a veteran of top-level competition in New Zealand where he
has played for Auckland and Counties, knows just how hard a task his
team have ahead of them.
''It's going to be a lot tougher this time round,'' said Fatilaofa.
''We have the players with the talent, but a lot of them haven't got
big match experience. I think our pride will pull us through, and our
resolve has never been stronger.
''The other teams will be tough, but we are not just going to stand
there and watch them.''
The Samoans' physical style, based on bone-shuddering tackling and
hard, direct running proved too much for Wales four years ago and even
disconcerted eventual champions Australia, who won an all-penalty pool
match 9-3.
A number of the 1991 side will be on display in South Africa,
including Brian Lima, who has developed into a world class winger and
scored his side's only try against South Africa.
Centre To'o Vaega has so far resisted the inducements of the rugby
league scouts, and the explosive Sila Vaufale remains the first choice
flanker.

NEW management is in place following a season of five defeats and a
wooden spoon. And with it, all Wales hopes, will spring a new vibrancy
of approach and a new age of Welsh success.
Well, that was the feeling too just a year ago after the Rob
Norster-Alan Davies management team had guided Wales to Five Nations
glory.
But now it is the turn of Australian coach Alex Evans, with the very
Welsh Geoff Evans as his manager, and with Mike Ruddock and Dennis John
as his coaching assistants, to try their luck at breathing fresh life
into a sleeping giant.
A new captain has also been appointed, Cardiff's Mike Hall taking over
from the much-loved Ieuan Evans -- though the former British Lion wing
keeps his place in the squad, if not the team.
Only in the heat of World Cup battle will it be proved whether the
drastic changes brought about following the defeat by Ireland in March
were justified, or whether they were an unfair over-reaction after a
season when Norster and Davies were hampered hugely by an astonishing
catalogue of injuries.
But the new set-up promises a new-look team to contest a group where
Ireland and Japan must be beaten -- assuming New Zealand will not be --
if Wales are to reach their initial aim of a quarter-final place.
That goal proved beyond their reach in the last World Cup, where
defeats by Australia and Western Samoa condemned them to the humiliation
of having to pre-qualify for this summer's tournament.
Former captain Gareth Llewellyn is to be switched from lock to
blindside flanker in an effort to improve Welsh power around the fringes
and to provide more line-out options.
The towering Derwyn Jones needs to show he can survive in the
international jungle and make his great height in the middle of the
line-outs count in terms of prized possession for his country.
Hemi Taylor and Stuart Davies look set to return to the back row, and
prop John Davies -- sent off against England on Five Nations duty in
February -- should return to bolster the front row.
In the backs a constant debate surrounds where, or if, Neil Jenkins
should play. But, whether at fly-half, full-back or centre, Jenkins'
remarkable accuracy and consistency with the boot can yet make him a
Welsh World Cup hero.
Verdict: A quarter-final meeting with France, and then a defeat with
honour.

They are fast and attractive to watch, but Japan may be just to small
to make a dent in their World Cup opponents.
THE long and short of Japan's problems is: they're just too wee. Pacy
backs and forwards with superb handling skills make the Japanese a
thrill to watch but they will always remain also rans in world rugby
because of their size. Rugby is immensely popular in the country -- only
baseball ranks higher -- but success at international level founders on
the size question.
Shiggy Konno, the godfather of Japanese rugby, has often expressed the
wish that the rest of the world would stand still for 20 years so that
the extra inches Japanese youngsters are piling on would stand them in
better stead rather than simply maintaining the status quo.
In the short term, if you pardon the expression, the Japanese have
built up their back five with a couple of Tongans and a Taiwanese
player. The Japanese know they will never win an abundance of ball but
they can prosper on meagre rations. This was the case at the last World
Cup, when the input of the two Tongans in their back row -- Sinali Latu
and Ekeroma Tifaga -- helped them overcome a much larger Zimbabwe side
52-8.
Whisper it, but Japan also beat Scotland in 1989 and are regularly
successful in the Asian Championships each year. That said, it is
unlikely that they will do anything other than make up the numbers when
they arrive in South Africa. If they can win some ball, they undoubtedly
have the potential to trouble any back line in the tournament. Certainly
they were no walkovers. Ireland only beat them 32-16 in the last World
Cup. The two wings, diminutive flier Yoshihito Yoshida and former
Wallaby wing Ian Williams, who is now working as a lawyer in Tokyo, are
very dangerous, as is courageous full back Takahiro Hosokawa.

ITALY'S have two great assets approaching the tournament: the influx
of top class players has improved the standard of the game and coach
Mark Ella provides vision and experience.
Ella inherited a good squad from Bertrand Fourcarde after the last
World Cup. That side had tasted some success, having convincingly beaten
the USA, and pushed New Zealand all the way in their 31-21 loss.
Italy boast a competent pack and a mercurial back division which
includes wing Marcello Cuttitta, fly-half Diego Dominguez, full back
Paolo Vaccari and utility back Ivan Francescato.
Up front Italy are equally competitive. Their scrum is anchored by
Masimo Cuttitta, brother of Marcello: while Favaro and Checchinato
provide a constant source of ball from the line-out. Australian born
Julian Gardner provides the edge in loose play.
Italy beat Romania well and thought they should have beaten Wales in
Cardiff.

After an absence from the World Cup of eight years, Tonga are aiming
to make people sit up and take notice of their uninhibited South Seas
style.
THE 1991 World Cup was a frustrating experience for Tonga, forced to
watch famous compatriot Willie Ofahengaue and South Seas neighbours
Western Samoa share the limelight while they stayed at home.
This time, though, the Tongans are back in the fold at Fiji's expense
after a gap of eight years and are determined to make the most of the
opportunity at a critical time for the sport in the Pacific islands.
As in Fiji, the lure of Australian rugby league, with its glamorous
image and lucrative contracts grows ever-stronger, all the more since
Rupert Murdoch announced his Super League plans.
No players of international standing have yet defected from union to
league, but many fringe players have made the switch.
After Tonga won the annual rugby league Pacific Cup last year, eight
Tongan-based players who also played for senior union clubs signed for
'feeder' league clubs in Australia.
At home, the more confrontational nature of league has drawn support
in growing numbers, while overseas sponsors, free playing gear, money
incentives and free sponsors' products, notably beer, have all helped
strengthen league's foothold.
Against this background, a 75-5 defeat by Canterbury in the Super 10
provincial competition in March was scarcely the World Cup launching-pad
they were looking for, but Tongan coach Sione Taumoepeau insisted the
result was merely a one-off disaster.
''They were good, we were bad, it was as simple as that,'' lamented
Taumoepeau. ''But we won't be doing that again ever.''
Up until Canterbury, Tonga had enjoyed a solid build-up for their
second World Cup finals, outscoring Fiji over two games last year to
qualify for South Africa with a better points differential.
They also had a successful tour of New Zealand, before narrowly losing
to the touring Welsh side 18-9 and going down 32-19 against Western
Samoa.
Even the most parochial Samoan supporter felt the Tongans were
unlucky, making much of the play and posting more tries.
''They gave us a hard time in the scrums and scored two tries by
running through our two best tacklers,'' said Samoan skipper Peter
Fatialofa.
Led by New Zealand-based Tongan number eight Mana Otai, who has played
his rugby at all but the highest levels in New Zealand, Tonga's forwards
have turned in some tigerish performances, with hard-charging hooker
Feao Vunipola and sensational flanker Ipolito Fenukitau prominent.
The Vunipola brothers, scrum-half Manu and fly-half Filisi will be
pivotal figures at half-back, but Taumoepeau admits the Tongan line-out
is still a worry.
''We really have to work on that part of our game. We have also been
giving away penalties for little discipline problems, and we are slow
starters, but once we get going, we're all right.
''I think Tonga are the same as Samoa. Our strength lies in running
the ball, retaining possession and playing at pace.
''I feel we can take care of Ivory Coast, so we have to knock out
Scotland or France to make it to the quarter-finals.''
Located south of Samoa and southeast of Fiji, Tonga consists of 171
islands, 36 of them inhabited, spread over 700,000 sq km of territorial
sea.
None of the islands in the Kingdom has a natural source of fresh
water, but the economy depends mainly on agriculture with successful
export crops, including squash to Japan and vanilla to the United States
and France.
Rugby is believed to have arrived via the Wesleyan missionaries who
first landed in 1869, but until then war had been a favoured pastime. At
one point in history, Tonga invaded Western Samoa and ruled in draconian
fashion for more than two centuries and they also frequently conquered
parts of Fiji.
One of the more notable days in Tongan sporting history came in 1969
when they beat Fiji at rugby for the first time, and Taumoepeau hopes
the current team can delight their supporters at home by securing their
first World Cup win.
''The World Cup has created a lot of excitement and support ... people
know even though we've had our losses, when we go down, we go down
fighting,'' he said.
''If Canterbury aren't in the World Cup, I think we've got a pretty
good chance.''

THE FACES of the Romanian squad as they trooped off Murrayfield after
a mauling told it all: Romania will struggle in the tournament.
The Romanians have hefty forwards but their pace is limited and, with
a back line that is hardly fleet-footed, the hard pitches of South
Africa could find them out.
The Romanians will try to play a safety-first, forward-dominated game
which served them well in the eighties but seems unsuited to South
African conditions.
They experimented in the 1991 with an expansive running game but it
was an alien game to most of the players and it led to a number of heavy
defeats.
Although they beat only Fiji in 1991, they made much progress as a
side and moved towards a game that was halfway between the expansive
game they wished to play and the tight game they were good at. Ever
gruelling up front, the Romanians took a heavy toll on opponents --
earning high praise from Canadian Norm Hadley.
In 1994, Romania's pack dominated Wales in the World Cup qualifier in
Bucharest, but they lost to a last-minute try, and followed it with a
disappointing short tour of England, primarily because of a disagreement
between some of the more established players and the management which
saw many of the best players omitted.
The Romanians have a solids pack, especially at the line-out where
Constantin Cojacariu is one of the best middle of the line jumpers in
the world. However, the pool matches will be the extent of their World
Cup.

Argentina have failed to live up to their potential. Ren Gowar
examines a team growing in confidence.
THIRTY years ago Argentina returned from their first tour as a major
rugby nation with enhanced reputations and a new nickname.
A win over South Africa's Junior Springboks represented a genuine
achievement; the nickname was a mistake.
Known to this day as the Pumas after the South American jaguarete on
their badge was misidentified, Argentina travel to the World Cup in
South Afica next month seeking another landmark.
The Argentines failed to get past the group stages in either of the
first two Cups, but new captain Sebastian Salvat believes they have the
potential to reach the quarter-finals.
''It's not such a remote objective, to win two of our matches to be in
the top eight in the world,'' said centre Salvat, a 28-year-old veteran
of the inaurgural 1987 World Cup, who missed the 1991 tournament.
Argentina, grouped with England, Western Samoa and Italy, were
probably at the peak during the era of fly-half Hugo Porta, now
Argentina's ambassador to Pretoria.
In 1982, Porta inspired the Pumas, touring South Africa as the South
American Jaguars in defiance of the international boycott, to a notable
21-12 victory over the Springboks to share a two-test series.
Porta looked set to lead Argentina into the quarter-finals of the
World Cup in 1987 but the Pumas flopped, losing to Fiji, who bagged the
place in the last eight.
''The mistake we made in 1987 was to train like a professional soccer
team. We were burnt out before the cup started,'' Salvat said.
Porta retired at the age of 40 before the 1991 World Cup, and
Argentine rugby has struggled since to recover from a player exodus to
Italy during the economic crisis in Argentina in the late 1980s.
Salvat criticised the Argentine Rugby Union's (UAR) reaction to the
loss of key players to Italy.
''They banned players who were playing their game, rugby union, but
still played against countries they considered professional,'' Salvat
said.
Argentina, who play two tests in Australia before the Cup, will be
going to South Africa with a dozen players who took part in the last
World Cup, where the Pumas lost to Australia, Wales and Western Samoa.
Among them is Tucuman wing Martin Teran, who scored two tries against
Australia and one against the Samoans.
Salvat, who plays for Alumni, and 32-year-old San Isidro Club wing
Diego Cuesta Silva, who with 57 caps is far and away the most
experienced Puma, are the only survivors of the 1987 World Cup squad.
Appointed captain this year after leading the team in some of the tour
matches in South Africa last year, although not in the tests, Salvat
said Argentina needed to ''recover the historic characteristics that put
Argentine rugby where it is: team spirit, tackling, pressure,
scrummaging.
''To that we must add concepts of modern rugby, continuity of play,
control of the ball, and, of course, a goal kicker of top international
level.''
The Pumas' pack surprised the South Africans by often dominating the
Springbok forwards in the two tests last year, but still lost 42-22 and
46-26.
Full-back Santiago Meson kicked all 29 points, an Argentine record, in
a 29-26 test win over Canada last month.
England coach Les Cusworth on a reconnaissance mission to Argentina in
March, said the Pumas, who beat Uruguay then Canada, ''have very good
handling, a strong front row and fast, decisive players. I saw a
definite improvement''.
Salvat said: ''We're working towards a peak and looking to explode
against England in Durban on May 27.
''They will surely be thinking they have to qualify and will want to
peak two or three weeks later than us. This is a small benefit we could
enjoy.''
Argentina's main doubts lie at half-back.
The more experienced pairing of fly-half Guillermo del Castillo and
scrum-half Rodrigo Crexell has stood out in notable victories by Rosario
province against strong foreign opposition, but they have not gelled
with the Pumas.
The alternative is the raw talent of 22-year-old Jose Cilley and
gifted scrum-half Agustin Pichot, 21 this month, who Cusworth compared
to Australia's George Gregan. The pair have only one cap between them.
San Isidro fly-half Cilley won his only cap when he flew in as a late
replacement three hours before kick-off for the second test against
South Africa in Johannesburg last year and scored 21 points.
''I go for experience,'' said Salvat. ''Historically the Pumas have
got good results with experience, putting something extra on the
field.''
The decision is down to the new pair of coaches appointed this year.
Alejandro Petra, who has guided Tucuman province to several Argentine
provincial titles in recent years, works mainly with the forwards.
Assistant Ricardo Paganini looks after the backs and knows Del Castillo
and Crexell well after several years as Rosario province's trainer.
Arguably the game's biggest adherents to the amateur ethic, the
Argentines are at present debating whether to give in to a player
request for a double daily allowance of $75 for the tour of Australia
and the World Cup.

A place in the ''pool of death'' will certainly test the mettle of a
Canadian squad in disarray.
CANADA, still smarting from a thrashing by the All Blacks last month,
have picked a squad heavily weighted to experience for the World Cup,
with only two players yet to make their international debut.
Canada have been drawn in the so-called ''pool of death'' for the
South African tournament next month, up against two of the top seeds,
Australia and South Africa.
The 26-strong squad will be captained by outside-half Gareth Rees, who
needs just one more Test appearance to break the Canadian record of 31.
He is one of five players picked for all three World Cups, along with
veteran centre Steve Gray, who was injured in New Zealand but hopes to
be fit in time for South Africa.
The others are prop Eddie Evans, hooker Karl Svoboda and lock Glenn
Ennis.
''This is probably our most experienced team to go on the field at
international level,'' Canadian Rugby Union executive director John
Billingsley said.
However, the squad of 15 forwards and 11 backs includes two players
who have not yet played in an international test -- prop Richard Bice
and flanker Chris Michaluk.
Notably absent is former captain Norm Hadley, the 30-year-old forward
whose place in the squad was thrown in doubt after his outspoken
criticism of the team and coach Ian Birtwell.
Canada was left in disarray after being trounced by 73-7 by the All
Blacks in the five-match tour of Fiji and New Zealand.
The defeat was a stark reminder of the state of rugby in Canada, where
it is still a minor amateur sport.
Their opening game is against Romania tomorrow.

POOL A
AUSTRALIA: The top seeds and holders warmed up with two big wins over
Argentina earlier this month. They have three aces -- the world's best
goalkicker in Michael Lynagh, the world's top try-scorer in David
Campese, and inspirational coach Bob Dwyer. They look simply the best.
Past record: 1987: fourth. 1991: winners.
SOUTH AFRICA: The hosts are seeded ninth because they did not compete
in 1991 but in reality should be rated anywhere from second to fourth in
the rankings. Since returning to Test rugby three years ago, the
Springboks have beaten all the major nations except the All Blacks. They
are capable of galvanic rugby and are desperate to beat Australia in the
opening match in order to avoid England in the pool games. Captain
Francois Pienaar is a perfect leader, Chester Williams a brilliant wing
finisher, and Joost van der Westhuizen an unorthodox, try-scoring
scrum-half. First World Cup.
CANADA: Seeded because they were quarter-finalists in 1991 but have
little chance of reaching the last eight from this ''group of death''.
They rely too heavily on the boot of Gareth Rees. They will be hoping
for one freak result similar to that which gave them a home win over
France last year. 1987: eliminated at pool stage. 1991:
quarter-finalists.
ROMANIA: Almost certain to come last in this pool. They regularly
concede huge scores to the top countries. They have discarded some of
the younger players who failed to emerge last season and have gone back
to veterans. 1987 and 1991: eliminated pool stage.
POOL B
ENGLAND: Seeded second after being beaten finalists last time. They
should win their group against unfamiliar opposition but might get
bruised in the process. It gets tough for Europe's Grand Slam champions
after that with either the hosts or holders to be played in the
quarter-finals. Rob Andrew's boot, a big, powerful pack and Jeremy
Guscott are England's chief weapons. 1987: quarter-finalists. 1991:
runners-up.
WESTERN SAMOA: Seeded after reaching 1991 quarter-finals, where they
lost to Scotland. Their big upset was beating Wales. Top players
sometimes defect to New Zealand and they lost by 70 points to Australia
recently. Star player is wing Brian Lima, who has scored 15 tries in 17
Tests. Strengths are their all-out attacking style and the most
ferocious tackling in world rugby. 1991: quarter-finalists.
ARGENTINA: The Pumas have just lost heavily in two Tests to Australia
but before that beat Canada. They also beat an experimental Scotland
team in both Tests last year. Main points-scorer will be full-back
Santiago Meson, who set a national record of 29 with eight penalties and
a try in that win over Canada. 1987 and 1991: eliminated in pool stage.
ITALY: The Italians arrive with the boost of a win over Ireland. All
three teams in this pool behind England have a realistic chance of
qualifying for the last eight. Italy lost only 23-20 to Australia last
year. Diego Dominguez is their best hope of points with his prolific
goal-kicking. When they are in trouble they kill the ball and are
constantly offside. 1987 and 1991: eliminated in pool stages.
POOL C
NEW ZEALAND: Seeded third after winning the play-off four years ago,
the All Blacks are certainties for the last eight but have not been
mentioned frequently in terms of winning the cup. They have lost to
England, France and Australia in recent Tests. But the Kiwi tradition
and rugby know-how will be at work and nobody writes off an All Black
side. 1987: winners; 1991: third.
IRELAND: Seeded after reaching 1991 quarter-finals. Ireland's first
task is to beat Wales, which they frequently do away from home, and
reach the quarter-finals. But the winning habit is not ingrained. They
lost to Italy only 10 days before travelling to South Africa. They
changed their captain during the season and Terry Kingston faces a huge
task. Star backs Jonathan Bell and Simon Geoghegan will relish firm
grounds. 1987 and 1991: quarter-finalists.
WALES: Had to pre-qualify after being knocked out in the pool stages
by Western Samoa last time. They managed to win the European qualifier,
but when they got back to meeting the big countries they were
whitewashed in the Five Nations. This led to a change of coach and
captain. Australian Alex Evans is the coach with Mike Hall the new
leader. Whatever happens, Wales will qualify automatically for the 1999
World Cup as hosts. 1987: third. 1991: eliminated in pool stages.
JAPAN: Will be encouraged by the poor form of Ireland and Wales but
realistically are booked for last place in this group. Their smaller
players struggle for possession but when they have the ball they run as
well as any other nation. 1987 and 1991: eliminated in pool stage.
POOL D
FRANCE: There should be no problems for the two seeds in qualifying,
but France, along with Scotland, desperately want to come top to have an
easier quarter-final and avoid New Zealand. The French had a poor Five
Nations, with defeats by England and Scotland, but they have tons of
talent. Goalkicking might be a crucial weakness. 1987: Runners-up. 1991:
quarter-finalists.
SCOTLAND: Have rallied remarkably after an appalling 1994. Won their
first three matches in the Five Nations and were shaded out by England
in the Grand Slam decider. Gavin Hastings has a hugh responsibility as
leader and goalkicker in his last matches before he retires. A win over
France could mean that they will go further than any other European
side. 1987: quarter-finalists. 1991: fourth.
TONGA: At least the Tongans will beat the Ivory Coast. In the Super
Tens they lost 75-5 to Canterbury, leading to a clear-out of the
coaching team and manager. Strength is their running and the customary
lethal tackling of South Sea Islanders. 1987: eliminated in pool stage.
IVORY COAST: Surprised everybody in qualifying by virtue of beating
both Namibia and Zimbabwe in the African play-offs. Look certain to
concede masses of points -- as they did when they toured South Africa,
losing 97-7 to Northern Transvaal and 67-10 to Western Transvaal.

THE night that Ireland became the first International Board country to
lose to Italy, the players sat glumly around the lobby of their hotel in
Treviso, physically and emotionally drained. They had performed badly
and they were aware of it.
Terry Kingston, the hooker and captain, who had had an indifferent
match, was not about to make excuses, nor was he going to moan about the
state of Irish rugby.
Kingston was philosophical, morale-battered perhaps, but very
definitely unbowed.
''These things happen,'' he said. ''There is no sense crying about it
nor must we forget that we lost to a very good Italian side. Losing was
disappointing, but now we know what we have to do and we simply must get
up and get on with it.''
Kingston, who won his first cap -- against Wales -- in the inaugural
World Cup in 1987, is no stranger to disappointments. But he is nothing
if not a survivor.
His debut was made in difficult circumstances at Wellington, where he
was catapulted into the side -- aged 23 -- when first-choice hooker
Harry Harbinson broke down in training. ''A shot out of the blue'' is
how Kingston recalls his promotion.
''I was thrown in at the deep end, but I didn't mind,'' he says. ''All
my life at school and long afterwards, I had dreamed about playing for
Ireland and I still remember the thrill when I was told I was in the
team.''
England's 35-3 destruction of Ireland at Twickenham in 1988 brought a
hiccup to Kingston's international career, as he lost his place to
Ulstermen John McDonald and Steve Smith. But he was restored in 1990
against France and Wales, toured Namibia the following summer and then
won a place in the 1991 World Cup squad, though still as reserve hooker
to Smith.
Kingston's tenacity was rewarded when he was given the captaincy in
the match against Japan. But the honour did not prevent Smith holding on
as first choice hooker while Kingston languished in the international
wilderness.
His restoration began when he captained his province Munster in an
exciting last-minute win against the touring Australians during the
autumn of 1992. Kingston was back in the national side for the next two
seasons before losing his place to Keith Wood in Australia last summer.
''Terry was the first to congratulate me,'' said Wood at the time.
''But he is too good a player to take it lying down and he will fight
like hell to win his place back.''
Wood's comments were to be prophetic. Kingston was restored for the
match against France in Dublin last March and two weeks later was
awarded the captaincy against Wales at Cardiff, which was Ireland's only
victory in this season's Five Nations' championship.
Late that night in the team's hotel in Newport, the unashamedly
emotional Kingston lustily joined in the sing-song, tears streaming down
his face. His spirit is infectious and Wood was right.
Kingston is too good a player to take that defeat by Italy lying down,
any more than he meekly accepted that his international days were ended
when he lost his place in Australia last summer.
BRIAN Smith won six caps for Australia as a scrum half and scored two
tries against Ireland in the 1987 World Cup. Two years later, Smith had
not only changed position -- to stand off -- but he had changed
nationality after discovering an Irish granny, winning nine caps for the
Emerald Isle before defecting to rugby league.

The mood in Dublin is one of ''quiet pessimism''. Mike Baldwin reports
on the trials and tribulations of the men in green who face a crunch
match with Wales.
DEFEAT by Italy in a World Cup warm-up fixture earlier this month has
put into sharp focus the problems blighting Ireland as they prepare for
South Africa.
At the moment, the Irish are suffering lack of form, confidence, and a
coherent playing pattern. Apart from that, as the Irish themselves would
say, everything is going great.
Ireland can, however, salvage something from World Cup year by again
beating Wales to earn themselves a quarter-final place.
In March, their victory in Cardiff meant that the Five Nations'
Championship's infamous wooden spoon would go to Wales rather than
across the Irish Sea.
Now the Irish know that everything in their World Cup group, which is
headed by New Zealand, rests on their meeting with Wales.
The winners would then most probably face a quarter-final against
either Scotland or France -- and so the prospect of some glory beckons
for the men in green.
The mood in Ireland at present, though, is described by one
commentator as ''quiet pessimism''.
There are fears that the squad chosen for battle is not good enough --
or prepared enough -- to make an impression during the tournament.
A groin injury currently keeps Simon Geoghegan, Ireland's one
world-class back, out of action -- and there are worries too that
mistakes have been made with the omission of players such as wing Niall
Woods and utility forward Mick Galwey.
Against Italy, the forwards were dismal, and there is an imbalance and
lack of stature in the back row which is especially causing concern.
Paddy Johns, the only No 8 in the squad, has played most of his rugby
in the second row -- and while there are three openside flankers going
to South Africa there is just a single specialist blindside man.
At stand-off, Paul Burke, though a talented footballer, is slight of
stature and an obvious weakness when opposition back row forwards are
seeking to punch holes in the midfield.
Eric Elwood, the stronger tackler and better goalkicker, remains out
of favour.
Selection decisions will have to be made, too, at scrum-half. Niall
Hogan missed the Italy trip because of medical examinations and he could
yet start the tournament in the No 9 shirt.
But what Ireland most need, as they finish World Cup preparations this
week in a training camp in Kilkenny, is to rediscover the rampaging
forward play and powerful spirit which has been the constant factor
running through all their successes of recent times -- however few those
have been.
In the last World Cup, the eventual winners, Australia, all but fell
to just that spirit in a memorable quarter-final in Dublin.
This time, on foreign soil, Ireland will have to pull even harder than
they did on that day.
Verdict: Must beat Japan, but that could be all. An early journey home
beckons.

The Ivory Coast, Scotland's first opponents, expect to be overwhelmed
in the group matches. But haven't we Scots heard that before from world
cup oppponents? Clotaire Achi reports on the Elephants that claim to be
pushovers.
THE Ivory Coast, shock arrivals at world rugby's top table, are known
as the Elephants in their homeland but are in serious danger of being
trampled underfoot themselves when they reach South Africa in May.
Even before their ill-fated recent warm-up tour which included a 97-7
defeat to Northern Transvaal, the Ivorian team had been struggling to
make an impact in their own country where football is king.
Now, there seems every chance they will make world headlines for all
the wrong reasons. Successive pool matches against Scotland and France
in the space of five days would stretch any side, and Italy's record
64-point World Cup margin of defeat to New Zealand in 1987 could easily
come under threat.
Mention the World Cup and most Ivorians will relive with you the 1994
exploits of Italy's Baggio, Brazil's Romario, or Nigeria's Yekini.
Mention the Rugby World Cup and the chances are you will simply get a
blank look.
''Every Ivorian is a soccer player practically from birth,'' says
Gervais Coffie, president of the Ivorian Rugby Federation. ''People play
football with anything at all here -- a lemon, an orange, a grapefruit,
a tennis ball.''
Coffie admits that ''no-one was more surprised than us'' when the
Ivorian squad upset the form books in Casablanca in June to qualify for
their first finals by beating zone favourites Namibia 13-12 and then
Zimbabwe 17-10.
Zimbabwe coach Colin Osborne was distinctly unimpressed with the Ivory
Coast's style of rugby, but accepted his side lacked maturity to deal
with their sometimes unconventional approach.
Since then, though, some of the initial Ivorian euphoria has vanished.
''We are realistic. We will not chase after miracles and let everyone
think that we are going to pull off extraordinary feats,'' says Coffie.
''We draw pride and huge satisfaction that we are the first (senior
Ivorian national sporting team) to take part in a World Cup,'' he says.
''Perhaps we won't go far but we are still taking part all the same.''
Rugby in Ivory Coast is an import from former colonial ruler France
and was initially a white man's sport.
Black Ivorians started taking an interest in the 1950s before
independence and in the 1960s, when most clubs were French-run and most
players and trainers were French.
''Little by little they recruited Ivorians who played with them,''
recalls Coffie, whose first taste of rugby was in the 1950s with a team
called Joan of Arc run by a white priest.
Today, 5000 Ivorians play rugby. There are 10 major clubs, but the
core of the national side play their competitive rugby in France and the
squad has a French technical director, Dominique Davanier.
Davanier, a former flanker with Toulouse in the French first division,
has been involved with the Ivory Coast for the last two years, and
singles out second row forward Djakaria Sanoko and Madagascar-born
scrum-half Frederic du Pont, who play with top French clubs Biarritz and
Nimes, as men to watch.
Du Pont is likely to form an important half-back link with captain
Athanase Dali, who remains optimistic even after the South African tour
which also included a 67-10 drubbing by Western Transvaal.
''We expect to win a game in the World Cup despite our disappointing
performances,'' said a defiant Dali. ''It's important to show the world
we can play good rugby, and it's important to show the young guys back
home that rugby is a good game.
''Not many of us knew each other before this tour and we are not used
to playing together, that's our main problem.
''The South African teams we met were all very organised amongst the
forwards. That is something we must learn, because rugby starts with the
forwards. If you can't win ball you have problems, even if you have the
best backline in the world.
''We had a particular problem with combating the rolling mauls. It's
something we see very little of and it's difficult to stop without
giving away penalties.''
Only Tonga in Pool D appear to offer Ivory Coast any chance of World
Cup success, even with two weeks altitude training in the French
Pyrennes.
But discipline remains a problem judging by the dismissal of second
row Bado Gilbert for head-butting against Northern Transvaal, and
observers felt they were lucky not to have others sent off during a
second-half free-for-all against Western Transvaal.

France pose the biggest threat to Scotland in the group matches. But
are they the side which defeated New Zealand 2-0 in a series or the team
that played so disapointingly in the Five Nations? Patrick Vignal talks
to coach Pierre Berbizier, below, about his enigmatic charges.
BEFORE this season's Five Nations' campaign, French coach Pierre
Berbizier scrawled a simple message on a board at the team's training
camp.
''Be there on June 24,'' Berbizier wrote, an expression of the
confidence in the French camp that they would be contesting the World
Cup final in Johannesburg.
France started the Five Nations championship this year with a 2-0
series victory over New Zealand behind them and looking not only to the
Grand Slam but optimistic they would become the first European side to
lift the World Cup.
However the bright promise of New Zealand withered on European
pitches, with the French looking clumsy, sluggish and settling in the
end for a mediocre record of two wins and two losses.
''I still believe this team is good enough to do well in South
Africa,'' said Berbizier despite the crushing 31-10 loss to England and
a surprise 23-21 defeat by Scotland.
''The tournament was a disappointment but even if we played badly and
if we lost two matches, we still scored more tries than England.
''I believed the final was a reasonable goal after our achievements in
New Zealand and I hoped that the adventure which had started there would
take us to Johannesburg.
''I still hope we can make it but I must admit I have been
disappointed by the team.''
The condemnation was less harsh than Berbizier's reaction after the
French lost 24-20 to Argentina in Nantes three years ago.
''I feel I have been betrayed by young brats,'' he snapped on that
occasion.
But the sorry truth for France is that little seems to have changed
over the years. On a good day the French can beat anybody in the world,
on a bad afternoon they can be beaten by anybody in the world.
Berbizier's analysis of the French failings during the Five Nations
campaign was typically trenchant.
''Our goal kicking was poor and we lost too many balls,'' said
Berbizier without ''When you lose 25 balls in one match against a team
like England, you can't expect miracles.''
Only a handful of players, including full back Jean-Luc Sadourny who
has been more than an adequate replacement for the incomparable Serge
Blanco, and the robust lock Oliver Merle have pleased Berbizier in the
team's last matches.
Neither the gifted but erratic Christophe Deylaud nor th inexperienced
Yann Delaigue, has proved satisfactory and their much vaunted back row
looked distinctly second rate compared to England's formidable trio.
France should nevertheless move past Tonga and Ivory Coast and make
sure of a quarter-final berth. If they lost to Scotland, though, in
their last pool D match on June 3 they face the unpleasant prospect of
meeting New Zealand for a place in the last four.
''The match against Scotland will decide our fate in the tournament,''
said Berbizier, anticipating a clash which has an extra edge after
Scotland's first victory at Parc des Princes.
Centre Philippe Sella, preparing for his third World Cup, said he was
confident France would restore their pride.
''Even if the Five Nations' tournament did bring disappointment, we're
a great team and we will be eager to prove it,'' he said.
The French players, exhausted by a tough league schedule, caught their
breath in the Pyrenees resort of Font-Romeu where they spent eight days
training in high altitude before flying to South Africa.
''It's too late to change everything,'' said Berbizier, who once
dreamed aloud of a final against England at Ellis Park.
''What we need is to improve the spirit of the team to make sure
everyone will give the best he has.''

The All Blacks enter the finals in a period of self-doubt, assailed by
rugby league and beaten in series by France and Australia. Simon
Wellington reports on a team carrying lowered expectations.
THE New Zealand All Blacks, the world's best rugby union team for much
of the past decade, will travel to South Africa in the unusual position
of underdog.
New Zealand won the inaugural Rugby Union World Cup in 1987 with one
of the most ruthlessly efficient teams the rugby world has ever seen.
In 1991, they were the most feared and respected team before losing to
eventual winners Australia in a vibrant semi-final.
But this year's side go to the finals with a poor record, a history of
division, and threatened by the rugby league fever sweeping the country
since the Auckland Warriors' entry into the Australian premiership.
''If they lose there will be some acceleration of interest in the
Warriors, there will be an acceleration of players playing rugby league
and there will be a general degradation of people's belief and
enthusiasm for the All Blacks,'' said David Kirk, New Zealand's
victorious captain in 1987.
''If they win, and they play good rugby in winning, it will limit any
further movement and hopefully give the game a shot in the arm.''
Expectations are lower than in 1987 and 1991, when only winning was
good enough for a demanding public.
''New Zealanders understand it's a tough competition and we don't seem
to be going in with a really top team. Expectations are a bit lower than
they otherwise might have been,'' said Kirk.
''If they play well and get pipped in the final or semi-final, people
would understand.''
By their own standards, the All Blacks' form in the last 18 months has
been dismal.
They lost to England at Twickenham at the end of their 1993-94 tour,
France recorded a 2-0 series win in New Zealand, and Australia regained
the Bledisloe Cup in Sydney.
They did beat a sluggish South Africa 2-0 in a three-Test series, but
looked a pale imitation of their former selves.
''We'll get through to the semi-finals all right. but saying we'll win
is a different question. New Zealand will certainly have to improve on
last year's performance if we are to win,'' said Kirk.
There have also been rifts in management.
Coach Laurie Mains survived a challenge from John Hart last year after
a bitter campaign. In March, chairman Eddie Tonks quit when he
discovered plans to unseat him.
There is little doubt the 1995 team will be markedly weaker than in
1987 and at best only on par with 1991.
Rugby league, retirements, and shoddy treatment by the selectors have
gutted the All Blacks.
Of the outstanding players of 1991, Grant Fox retired along with Gary
and Alan Whetton. John Kirwan was dropped then went into rugby league
with Va'iaga Tuigamala, John Timu, and Craig Innes.
Injury, too, has taken its toll. Michael Jones, arguably their best
player of the last decade, has been dogged by injury, and only time will
tell how effective he will be in South Africa. The same goes for veteran
fellow flanker Mike Brewer.
While the front five looks solid, the loose forwards and inside backs,
reshuffled regularly last year, will be an unproven combination and a
major concern.
But New Zealand still has several players who could make the
tournament their own.
Zinzan Brooke was probably the world's best loose forward in 1994, and
Jeff Wilson is a winger of breath-taking skills.
But New Zealand may have to rely on newcomers unproven at the highes
level.
A cautionary tale. . .
THE All Blacks first World Cup captain was Andy Dalton who, returning
to duty from injury was given some extra time to recover by missing out
on pool matches. However, his deputy, Sean Fitzpatrick, played so well
that he retained his place throughout the competition and is now himself
All Black captain.
JOHN Allan (Scotland and South Africa), Jamie Salmon (New Zealand and
England), and Steve Bachop (Western Samoa and New Zealand) have all
played World Cup rugby for one country and played at test level for
another. However, Frank Bunce will take the blurring of national
identities to new heights when he turns out for New Zealand in this
campaign. Four years ago he was a Western Samoan in the same
competition.

The reigning world champions do not intend to leave the cup behind in
South Africa. Mike Baldwin reports on the side with a favourites'
chance.
CELEBRATED in story and song as the home of the laconic loner,
Australia in reality has always been a nation where team spirit has been
essential in a harsh, often hostile environment.
This cultural heritage has been given potent expression over the
decades by the Australian cricket side, who may be sometimes
individually inferior to their opponents but who will always fight for
their team and country with a cold-eyed ferocity.
Teamwork, extending far beyond the confines of the playing field, is
the key to appreciating the success of the resplendent Australian rugby
union side, who begin their World Cup defence in South Africa this
month.
Four years down the road from their triumph over England at
Twickenham, Australia continue to set the agenda for world rugby union.
In any history of 20th century sport, the Australian Institute of
Sport in the federal capital of Canberra will rate at least a paragraph.
It is here that the conditioning and diet routines which have made the
Wallabies the world's fittest side were devised.
Scientific fitness training, using modern equipment and techniques,
was introduced by the New Zealand All Blacks when they ruled supreme
during the late 1980s.
The Australians' enduring legacy has been to take a step further
forward and field a team of excellent all-round athletes in which, for
example, the spring-heeled John Eales is not only the finest line-out
jumper around but also a world-class goal-kicker.
England, Five Nations champions three times in the past five years,
have enthusiastically embraced the new full-time training ethos as the
game moves inexorably toward professionalism.
Crucially the Wallabies, under their visionary coach Bob Dwyer, have
quickly adapted to the revolutionary new rule awarding possession to the
defending side when play breaks down at a ruck or maul.
Dwyer has made it clear he dislikes the change, which has led to the
loose forwards hanging off rucks and mauls and lessening the control a
superior side can consistently exert.
But in Tim Horan and Jason Little, both now hopefully restored to
match fitness, he has two powerful centres who can, in effect, act as
loose forwards in the often crowded midfield outside captain and
playmaker Michael Lynagh.
In any era, the Wallaby World Cup side would stand out. The continuing
presence of a footballing genius in winger David Campese makes it one of
the outstanding sides of all time.
The top seeds and holders warmed up with two big wins over Argentina
earlier this month. They look simply the best. Past record: 1987:
fourth. 1991: winners.
FACTFILE
ROB Egerton's international career must be one of the most short-lived
and successful. He played eight matches on Australia's left wing in 1991
and won seven times including his last match, the World Cup final v
England at Twickenham.

England face a long and arduous road if they are to repeat their feat
of reaching another final. Terry Cooper reports on the mood in Jack
Rowell's camp.
ENGLAND had done everything right this season until they ran into what
manager Jack Rowell called ''a brick wall'' with the sack-then-back Will
Carling saga.
Nobody knows how restored captain Carling's squad will be affected by
the brief but traumatic episode.
The instant hope among players, coaches and administrators was that
the squad had been given an unexpected chance to make a private and
public display of unity that will make them stronger in the World Cup.
Until the sacking it was all going smoothly. England have had around
40 training-sessions since September to hone the new, expansive style of
play -- integrating backs and forwards -- that will be needed to
overcome the best.
''Any side that hopes to be successful in the World Cup has got to be
able to duplicate the Springboks' running game,'' said manager Jack
Rowell, who identified the need for a change of style while in South
Africa last year.
In between all that practice England crucially avoided disruptive
injuries and won all six matches -- heavy defeats over Romania and
Canada followed by the third Grand Slam of the 1990s.
''We had to be European champions to go to South Africa with any
credibility as potential winners,'' said Carling.
In the group matches England face Argentina, Italy, and Western Samoa.
They have played five Tests against Argentina, one World Cup tie against
the Italians, but have never played the Samoans.
The Pumas and the Italians are highly illegal operators in defence,
but the Samoans are positively dangerous in man-to-man conflict.
They injured five South Africans in a Test last month and England will
do well to stay clear of injury. They must rest key players in that
game.
But qualifying for the quarter-finals should not be a problem. It is
then that England run into obstacles set by the World Cup organisers.
After the pool stages they are insisting that England fly,
irrelevantly, to Johannesburg, though their quarter-final is in Cape
Town.
If England reach the semi-final they still have to fly back to
Johannesburg for a week instead of staying put, even though their next
match would be back in Cape Town.
If England get to the final they would have travelled 3000 totally
unnecessary miles.
At the last-eight stage England are set to meet either Australia or
South Africa. The Springboks are seeded ninth, but in reality are third
or fourth.
England are seeded second. So why are the second seeds meeting one of
the top four nations in the last eight when they should be playing the
seventh seeds, if the normal seeding structure is maintained?
''Because South Africa did not play in the last World Cup and could
not be seeded above any of the 1991 quarter-finalists,'' state the men
who are trying to run the event.
''It's no use moaning,'' said the pragmatic Carling. ''If we are going
to win the Cup we have to beat the best in the world anyway, so we might
as well start in the quarter-finals.''
But England's task looks like needing to defeat South Africa, New
Zealand, and Australia on consecutive weekends. It is a near-impossible
mountain.
England have worked endlessly to improve beyond the European context,
but the one plus they have compared with last summer's trip to South
Africa is a fit Jeremy Guscott.
Rob Andrew also will have the added confidence of a record-breaking
season as a goal-kicker and the Underwood brothers should relish the
conditions if they are given the ball.

WILL Carling's great escape from his dismissal as England's captain
was another stroke of good fortune in an amazing career.
The episode illustrated Carling's nature. He still does some silly
things -- his comments about the Rugby Union committee were juvenile --
but in the aftermath it became clear that he really is the best man to
lead England and is phenomenally popular.
Earlier in his career, he frequently had to attend Twickenham to
explain away indiscretions but was always exonerated.
In between, he has led England to numerous famous wins, broken records
and supervised the most successful period in the country's 125-year
history.
There have been three Grand Slams -- 1991, 92, and 95.
But rankles with him that on three occasions England were denied a
championship or Grand Slam when the honours beckoned, including that
famous day at Murrayfield in 1990.
Each time Carling's captaincy seemed uninspired.
The Carling luck was first in force in 1988 when both senior England
centres dropped out of the last trial match England ever played. Carling
was promoted from the junior team and hasstayed in the first team ever
since.
He played a mere seven matches before being promoted to captain.
Carling then bought his way out of the Army and was soon launched on a
career with his own company that advises industrialists on leadership.
Perceived as arrogant by some, Carling insists that he is a shy
person. But he has steel and ambition and he once said: ''I will never
give up the captaincy voluntarily.''

Under-19s and Under-21s before making A-team debut two years ago.
Uncapped, but has spent championship season on the bench. Had new lease

a blind-side flanker before moving to his favoured No 8 spot. Lost that
to Scott Quinnell last season, but after missing France game through
injury, recalled to the position against England.
H T Taylor (Cardiff) Age 30, 10 caps. Born in New Zealand, had a trial
for the Kiwi colts. He moved to Wales in 1986 and was capped when he

goals that beat New Zealand, on his debut, and Scotland last season,
including a last-minute winner at Murrayfield. Dropped after the defeat
by Ireland last year, he flew to South Africa as a replacement in May,
T Underwood (Leicester). Age 26, 16 caps. Has now fully emerged from
the shadow of his brother. He first made the England squad in Argentina
five years ago but suffered injury and was dropped twice after his 1992
debut which delayed his ''arrival''.
W D C Carling (Harlequins, captain). Age 29, 55 caps. Has led England
48 times, easily a world record. Under his command, England have lost
only 10 times, with 37 wins -- including three Grand Slams -- and a
draw. Will be intriguing to see how recent events have affected him.
J C Guscott (Bath). Age 29, 34 caps. Returned to England action last
autumn after a year out with a serious groin injury. A world-class
centre, he began his England career with a hat-trick on debut in Romania
in 1989 and has scored 17 tries for England.
R Underwood (Leicester). Age 31, 75 caps. England's most-capped player
and way in front as leading try-scorer with 42. He is in his 12th season
of international rugby after making his debut in 1984. He symbolises
England's improvement since the mid-1980s.
P R de Glanville (Bath). Age 26, 10 caps. Has been No 3 centre for
three seasons and has won three caps as a replacement, plus all seven
last season when Guscott, with whom he links for Bath, was absent. His
eye was savagely gashed by All Blacks' boots last season.
D Hopley (Wasps) 24, uncapped. Fourth in the English centre standings,
Hopley is being converted to a wing. Still has not been able to break up
the monopoly of the top three centres, despite being an A team regular.
I G Hunter (Northampton). Age 27, 5 caps. Has played both full-back
and wing for England and scored two tries on his debut against Canada.
But injuries have kept him out of internationals for 12 months. Has only
recently returned to rugby after five months out.
C R Andrew (Wasps). Age 32, 65 caps. Became England's top
points-scorer during his 24-point monopoly in the recent Grand Slam game
against Scotland. He now has 317 points, 166 of them since March 1994.
K P P Bracken (Bristol). Age 23, 8 caps. Dublin-born Bracken won his
first cap as a late replacement for Dewi Morris against New Zealand last
season. He kept his place for half the 1994 Five Nations season and took
his chance convincingly against against Canada in December.
C D Morris (Orrell). Age 31, 21 caps. Welsh-born Morris marked his
Test debut in 1988 with a try against Australia. He has had three spells
as unchallenged No 1 scrum-half in between seasons on the bench. He
played in all three Tests for the 1993 Lions.
J Leonard (Harlequins). Age 26, 38 caps. Became England's most-capped
prop when he played against Scotland. He has played every Test since his
debut in Argentina in 1990 and could amass a mountain of caps.
G C Rowntree (Leicester). Age 27, 1 cap. Came through as England's
reserve prop last season and, after 12 appearances on the bench, won his
first cap as a temporary ''blood'' replacement for Leonard against
Scotland.
J Mallett (Bath). Age 24, uncapped. Has recovered just in time from
another broken hand. Struggles to be chosen for Bath's
international-laden front row behind Ubogu but impressed the experienced
England forwards when he toured South Africa last year.
V E Ubogu (Bath). Age 33, 15 caps. Had played on both sides of the
front row before England settled him at tight-head prop. Nigerian-born,
he has removed doubts about his scrum abilities and is one of England's
forward battering rams.
B C Moore (Harlequins). Age 33, 58 caps. Has never come off the field
injured during his long tenanacy as hooker, which began in 1987. Despite
being comparitively small for hookers, he manages to compete against the
giants.
R G R Dawe (Bath). Age 35, 4 caps. Graham Dawe looked set for a host
of caps but, after being suspended for his alleged part in the 1987
battle of Cardiff, has played only once since -- in that year's World
Cup. Returned to replacements' bench last season.
M O Johnson (Leicester). Age 25, 12 caps. Martin Johnson won his first
England and Lions caps in the emergencies that followed injuries to Wade
Dooley in 1993. He and Bayfield are now a settled unit as England's
line-out experts.
M C Bayfield (Northampton). Age 28, 22 caps. Like Johnson, he got his
first chance as a deputy for injured Dooley, and also used his
opportunity as a launching pad for a permanent place. He recovered from
a neck injury and being dropped last season to become a regular this
year.
R West (Gloucester). Age 24, uncapped. Richard West has had only one A
team match, but entered the World Cup frame after the injury to Simon
Shaw. Is England's biggest player at 6ft 10in and 20st.
T A K Rodber (Northampton). Age 25, 14 caps. Made his debut as a No 8
three years ago but, like Clarke, has had to switch to the flank to
ensure a place as Richards continues to sew up the position in the
middle of the back row. Rated future England captain.
D Richards (Leicester). 31, 42. The player most respected and feared
by opponents. Made his debut with two pushover tries in 1986. Various
injuries and omissions from the team when his speed was questioned have
meant that his caps do not reflect his status.
B C Clarke (Bath). Age 26, 17 caps. Like Rodber, Clarke began his
international career as a No 8 three seasons ago. He was successfully
converted to open-side flank on the Lions tour of New Zealand in 1993.
S O Ojomoh (Bath). Age 24, 6 caps. Nigerian-born, has an athletics
background and it shows on the field. Made his debut as a late
replacement for Clarke last season and was one of the better players in
South Africa.
N A Back (Leicester). Age 26, 2 caps. One of the most debated players
in England, being, 5ft 10in, small for a modern flanker. He compensates
with his blinding speed to the ball and the handling skills of a
stand-off. Was given a two-cap chance last season but dropped after the
defeat by Ireland.

Gavin Hastings (Watsonians, captain). Age 33, 57 caps. Holds Scottish
records for appearances and points. Scored 56 points in this season's
Five Nations Championship, four more than his own previous record, set
in 1986. Retires from Tests after World Cup.
Craig Joiner (Melrose). Age 20, 8 caps. Scored a try on his Five
Nations debut against Ireland. A former member of the Scottish Schools
sprint squad, he played representative rugby at Under-18, 19, and 21
levels before graduating to the senior side in Argentina last summer.
Scott Hastings (Watsonians). Age 30, 54 caps. Has played alongside
brother Gavin 48 times. But only injury to Ian Jardine in Paris allowed
Scott the chance of reviving his own international career following a
loss of form earlier this season. A double British Lion.
Kenny Logan (Stirling County). Age 23, 16 caps. Logan is undoubtedly
the next big star of Scottish rugby, and many see him as the natural
successor to Gavin Hastings at full-back. He began his Scotland career
in that position, against Australia in 1992. A farmer.
Craig Chalmers (Melrose). Age 26, 42 caps. Chalmers equalled John
Rutherford's cap-record for a Scottish stand-off in the game against
Romania. An old head on still-young shoulders, Chalmers won a British
Lions cap in Australia when only 20. He is a marketing representative.
Bryan Redpath (Melrose). Age 23, 11 caps. At 5ft 7in, and 11st 8lbs,
Redpath is one of the smallest players in top-class rugby, but he makes
up for it in terrier-like performances. A key member of the Melrose side
who won three successive Scottish titles from 1992-94.
Derrick Patterson (West Hartlepool). Age 29, 1 cap. Patterson, a son
of Hawick, but who made his name with Edinburgh Accies before moving
south, filled the A N Other scrum half berth after injury to Andy Nicol.
He made his debut against South Africa last year.
Cameron Glasgow (Heriot's FP). Age 29, uncapped. The son of former
Scotland flank forward Ron Glasgow, graduated to the senior squad
through the ranks of Scottish Students and Scotland Under-21s. Played in
Scotland's non-cap Test against Japan in 1989.
Ian Jardine (Stirling County). Age 30, 8 caps. Jardine had made the
position of inside-centre his own this season before suffering a broken
cheekbone against France. Made his debut against New Zealand in 1991.
Made a successful return during tour in Spain.
Graham Shiel (Melrose). Age 24, 11 caps. Has won eight caps in the
centre and one at stand-off. Played for Scotland Under-19s and 21s and
has toured with the senior squad to New Zealand (1990), North America
(1991), Australia (1992) and Argentina (1994). A junior site manager.
Tony Stanger (Hawick). Age 26, 37 caps. Played in 35 successive
internationals. Scored five tries in his first two matches for Scotland,
against Fiji and Romania and has now successfully made the transition to
midfield. Was only 17 when he made his Hawick debut.
David Hilton (Bath). Age 25, 6 caps. The burly Bristolian qualifies
for Scotland through his grandfather Walter. Hilton attended the same
school in Bristol as Gareth Chilcott, who he has succeeded as prop in
the Bath front row following a move from Bristol in July 1992.
Kenny Milne (Heriot's FP). Age 33, 36 caps. One of three brothers who
have played for Scotland, hooker Milne made his debut in 1989 and was in
the No2 shirt during the 1990 Grand Slam campaign. Toured New Zealand
with the 1993 British Lions, played in First Test.
Peter Wright (Boroughmuir). Age 27, 12 caps. Has improved hugely since
experiencing mixed fortunes on the 1993 Lions tour to New Zealand and
earning just a solitary cap last year. First capped in 1992, against
Australia, Wright has now established himself.
Doddie Weir (Melrose). Age 24, 28 caps. Ten of his caps have come as a
No8, but for now Weir is happy to be back in the second row. Played in
22 successive internationals from October 1991 until March 1994 and is a
sales executive. Important presence in the lineout for Scotland.
Stewart Campbell (Dundee HSFP). Age 22, 6 caps. One of the new guard
who have helped transform Scotland this year, Campbell has graduated
from the successful Scotland A side which beat South Africa. He is a
student of architecture at Dundee University.
Rob Wainwright (West Hartlepool). 30, 13. A late starter in
international terms, Wainwright toured Japan with Scotland in 1989 but
did not win a full cap until 1992. His versatility may have been
counter-productive in the past, but is now an impressive presence.
Eric Peters (Bath). Age 26, 6 caps. A revelation at No.8 this year,
and one massive reason why Scotland have improved so much since beating
Canada. Born in Glasgow of Scottish parents, Peters was brought up in
Essex. He played for England Under-21s and England Students.
Iain Morrison (London Scottish). Age 32, 12 caps. Morrison is an
unsung hero of Scotland's resurgence. A tireless and intelligent
openside flanker, Morrison's international career has been constantly
interrupted by injury. A sevens expert, he works for a financial
institution.
Paul Burnell (London Scottish). Age 29, 37 caps. A member of
Scotland's Grand Slam pack in 1990, tight-head prop Burnell was also an
ever-present during the Five Nations campaigns of the next four seasons
before losing his place this season to Peter Wright.
Damian Cronin (Bourges). Age 31, 32 caps. A British Lion in 1993, he
rejuvenated his international career this season only to suffer injury
during Scotland's victory in Paris. Made his Scotland debut in 1988 and
was a member of Bath's all-conquering side.
Kevin McKenzie (Stirling County). Age 27, 3 caps. He has represented
Scotland at every level, winning two senior caps in Argentina last
summer and his third against Romania last month. A stalwart, and
captain, of the successful Scotland A side. A sales representative.
John Manson (Dundee HSFP). 26, 1. Won his first cap in the Grand Slam
decider at Twickenham, coming on as a second-half replacement for the
injured Dave Hilton. Earlier this year he owed his elevation to
Scotland's replacements' bench to an injury to Paul Burnell.
Jeremy Richardson (Edinburgh Academicals). 31, 1. A member of
Scotland's World Cup squad in 1987, he had to wait until November last
year for his so far solitary cap. Heavy defeat against South Africa made
it an unpleasant experience and he was dropped.
Ian Smith (Gloucester). age 30, 8 caps. He was an England under-18
trialist and played for England B in 1989. In 1990 he was a reserve for
England's summer tour of Argentina, and was actually in England's World
Cup squad before switching his allegiance.
Peter Walton (Northampton). Age 25, 3 caps. Now a blindside flanker,
Walton played prop for the England Colts side and played for Gosforth
before moving to Northampton. Represented the Scottish Schools six times
between 1986-87, captaining them on one occasion.

THE future begins here. Or, to be more precise, Scotland's future RWC
prospects begin at exactly 3 o'clock UK time tomorrow afternoon.
In the Olympia Park Stadium, at Rustenburg, nearby the team base at
Pretoria, Scotland will get their World Cup campaign under way against
the unknowns of Ivory Coast.
The next 80 minutes will determine whether the blood, sweat and, maybe
even, tears that have characterised Scotland's build-up to the greatest
rugby adventure that any of the squad have ever experienced have been
worthwhile.
Scotland are drawn in a Pool containing France, Tonga and Ivory Coast.
Of the Cote d'Ivoir, little is known. Ivorian rugby is a legacy of
French colonial rule and they were the surprise winners of the zone
qualification rounds when they defeated both Morocco and, surprisingly,
Zimbabwe, who were Murrayfield pool contenders just four years ago.
The Ivorians' preparation has gone somewhat awry, including, as it
did, a 97-7 trouncing by Northern Transvaal. Nevertheless, with players
steeped in the French tradition, including some from the French domestic
scene, they cannot be treated overly lightly.
Remember, in a footballing context, the ditty which went something
along the lines of: ''Peru, Peru, here's what the boys in blue are going
to do to you?'' Those lines should be posted above the Scotland
dressing-room door.
Nevertheless, if Scotland cannot put The Elephants to the sword then,
perish the thought, an early return from South Africa is on the cards.
Similarly with Tonga. The islanders appear to be hewn from teak, but
anything other than a win would mean that Scotland's South Sea bubble
had burst in spectacular fashion.
Because of the likely outcome of the other three pools, it is a
virtual necessity that Scotland finish top of their group.
If the Scots beat the other pool contenders, then the likelihood is
that they will face either Wales or Ireland in the quarter-finals.
In view of the resurgent form shown by Scotland in the Five Nations'
championship, with both Home nations disposed of in more than
satisfactory fashion, Gavin Hastings and his men would have to fancy
their chances against the men from the Emerald Isle and Wales who, in
recent weeks, have got themselves a new captain, coach and manager.
To finish top of the pool standings, Scotland will have to beat
France. And, again, with the first away victory over the Tricolors in 26
years still fresh in the mind, such a scenario is not outwith the bounds
of reasonable possibility. That, then, is the optimum route for
Scotland's progression through the ranks.
With Wales or Ireland in the quarter-finals, you would have to
consider a semi-final berth -- just as in 1991 -- a distinct
possibility. And then . . . well the sky has to be the limit.
The less attractive scenario is that Scotland lose to France and come
second in the pool. Then, on the assumption that New Zealand will see
off Wales, Ireland and Japan to finish top of their group, the All
Blacks lie in wait for Scotland at the Loftus Versfeld stadium in
Pretoria.
In 90 years of trying, Scotland have never managed to tame the All
Black beast. They have come close -- and never more so than in the
second Test at Auckland in 1990 when David Sole's Grand Slam side took
New Zealand to within three points at 21-18 -- but the best that
Scotland have managed from 17 attempts are two draws.
The weight of historical precedent, then, lies heavily in favour of
the men from the land of the long white cloud.
Throughout this season's Five Nations' campaign, and beginning with
the pre-tournament win over Canada, Scotland have improved with every
game. Manager Duncan Paterson has called termed it a ''one step at a
time campaign''.
Warm-up games against Romania and Spain have been negotiated with
workmanlike efficiency and, last time out against the Spanish in Madrid,
Hastings and his men performed with ruthless efficiency to score ten
tries in a 62-7 fiesta in the sun.
That is a solid platform from which to launch a World Cup offensive,
and the more so when one remembers that, in 1991, when the Scots came
fourth in the world, the wheels had come off in notable fashion with
warm-up defeats by Romania and Edinburgh Borderers!
Gavin Hastings, who has been an inspiration throughout the Five
Nations campaign, has done just about everything that there is to do in
the world of rugby. He has won a Grand Slam. He has been on two Lions'
tours, captaining the tourists in New Zealand, and this will be his
third World Cup. He has indeed, been there, done that and, no doubt he
has T-shirts aplenty.
He declared: ''This is going to be the biggest thing that I have ever
been involved in. It is huge. The season just past has been momentous.
''But I see no reason why, if we can maintain the progress that we
have been making since January, why the World Cup can't be as momentous
as everything that has gone before.''
Hastings will retire from the world stage at the close of proceedings
in South Africa. This season he has seemed, at times, to have been
writing his own scripts. Success in South Africa would constitute some
exit line!

South Africa,
THE globe is oval for the next four weeks. The Rugby World Cup, still
a mere stripling of eight summers, has grabbed the imagination of the
worldwide rugby public in a manner that would have been unthinkable in
1987 when the first tournament was staged in Australia and New Zealand.
Within the space of eight years, the competition has mushroomed to
occupy a slot in the sporting calendar which ranks in scale behind only
the association code equivalent and the Olympic Games.
That first tournament in 1987, only 57 years after the first football
World Cup -- no-one could accuse the rugby authorities of being
impetuous -- has changed the face of the game forever. Until the All
Black David Kirk mounted the steps of the Eden Park stadium in Auckland
to lift on high the William Webb Ellis Trophy, rugby worldwide had been
compartmentalised into a series of claustrophobic, domestic competitions
which operated in isolation each from the other.
In the Northern Hemisphere the Five Nations tournament -- still a
jewel beyond price and the envy of Southern Hemisphere nations --
provided the highlight of the European season, while in the Antipodes,
Australia and New Zealand did battle for the Bledisloe Cup.
Both competitions were hard fought and represented the Holy Grail
north and south of the equator but both were parochial and
inward-looking.
The four-yearly tours by the British Lions provided the only
opportunity for North and South to meet in rugby combat and all the
while those nations on the periphery of the game -- the South Sea
islanders, Canada, Argentina and all the rest -- were left to pick up
whatever scraps they could from the rich rugby man's table.
And most perversely of all South Africa was left on the sidelines.
Rightly -- although not all rugby folk think so -- the Springboks were
left kicking their heels as the apartheid regime held sway. The men in
the myrtle and gold shirts were absent from the first two RWC
tournaments in 1987 and 1991.
At Twickenham, as England and Australia contested the 1991 final,
there were strategically based banners bearing the legend ''South
Africa, the true World Champions''. It was boastful and it was
provocative. But now, and just two years ago who would have believed it,
Nelson Mandela's South Africa will host the competition. ''South Africa,
the true World Champions''? Well, we shall know soon enough.
The four-week carnival of rugby gets under way today in Cape Town when
the hosts play the reigning champions Australia. There have been
problems aplenty for the organisers. For the first time in a generation
South Africa, as it emerges from its years of international isolation,
finds itself the focus of world attention for something other than
township riots and its distasteful creed of ''separate development''.
There have been doubts about the infrastructure of a nation which has
had to drag itself back into the mainstream after thirty years in the
backwater which resulted from the Gleneagles Agreement and punitive
trade sanctions. Will the country's hotel trade cope with the thousands
of supporters and media representatives who will, by now, have
descended?
Will the internal flight facilities cope with the locust-like mass
movement as rugby fans flit from ground to ground and city to city? Can
the tele-communications system handle the despatches which the thousands
of medi-types will transmit to hundreds of newspapers and television
stations all over the globe?
Louis Luyt, self-made millionaire and autocratic president of the
South African Rugby Board, is not known for self-doubt. ''The tournament
will provide a festival of dazzling rugby, friendship and sunshine. You
will see the most spectacular success and an awful lot of money will be
made'' he declares with absolute certainty.
The extravaganza is expected to attract millions of rand into the
South African economy. The tournament itself is on schedule to generate
income of some #30m and a surplus of #20m which will be distributed over
the oval globe to nurture the worldwide game.
An indication of just how handsomely the exercise has grown can be
gathered from the fact that profits from 1991 were bigger than the
entire turnover of the inaugural 1987 event and a similar feat is
expected this year.
And the worldwide television audience this year is on a level which
could only have been dreamt of during that ''toe in the water'' exercise
in 1987. RWC committee chairman, the former Irish diplomat Sir Ewart
Bell, says: ''TV is an intrinsic part of the success formula of RWC. It
is not only the biggest contributor in terms of finance, but it is also
our main shop window. An expected cumulative audience of 2.5 billion
people in 120 countries will watch the games this month.''
The host broadcaster is the South African Broadcasting Corporation. In
the UK -- and just as they were in 1991 -- the pictures will be provided
by ITV which has invested over #8m in its RWC package that entails 65
hours of rugby, including 23 live matches plus extensive highlights,
reviews and previews.
As the 1995 tournament gets under way, the game itself is standing at
the cross-roads. It was at the 1987 tournament, when for the first time,
players from a' the airts had the opportunity to discuss common
interests over a post-match glass of beer, that tales were traded of the
financial rewards that were to be had under the jurisdiction of
different unions and federations.
Until then the Northern Hemisphere Unions had approached the prickly
thorn of filthy lucre as might the temperance movement approach a boozy
night out. In short, they didn't want to know.
Players from Scotland, England and all the rest, watched with
amazement as All Blacks appeared on TV advertisements. There seemed to
be double standards at work.
Since then international players -- under pressure from the competing
interests of work, family and rugby -- have been increasingly vociferous
in their demand for a slice of the financial action which they, by their
sweat and toil on the pitch, help to generate.
When the RWC returns to the Northern Hemisphere in 1999 -- to the UK,
Ireland and France -- it would be a brave man indeed who would attempt
to predict the financial condition of the game. Will it be professional?
Will it be semi-pro? The International Rugby Football Board sought to
establish binding guidelines on the shamateurism issue at its annual
general meeting earlier this year.
A decision was postponed until after the South African extravaganza.
By the year's end, however, the IB should have in place a set of
regulations which satisfy the demands of the players while still
maintaining the ethos of a game which stands unique in the league of
big-time sport. That, at least, is the hope.
Now is the time for strong leadership and for the formulation of a set
of enforceable rules which all of the competing interests feel they can
live with.
No doubt over the next four weeks the professionalism issue will be
aired but for the 16 nations competing in the greatest rugby spectacle
the world has yet seen the major focus will surely be on the Webb Ellis
Trophy.
Named in honour of the Rugby schoolboy who first dared to challenge
convention and run with the ball in his hands, the sterling silver
trophy, crafted by the Crown jewellers Garrards in 1906, is the
glittering bauble that six games from now awaits just one of the sixteen
hopefuls.
Which nation will add its name to that of New Zealand and Australia on
Saturday, June 24? The talking is over. Let action commence.
