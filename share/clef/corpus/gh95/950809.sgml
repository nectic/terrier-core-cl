Taba, Egypt,
THE PLO and Israel took a big step toward expanding long-delayed
Palestinian autonomy with an agreement today setting a timetable for
Israel's withdrawal from occupied parts of the West Bank.
The deal came during talks in the Red Sea resort of Taba clearing the
way for Palestinian elections. Yasser Arafat and Israeli Foreign
Minister Shimon Peres met for a second time tonight.
The Palestinians won a definite timetable, which they had long
demanded, but agreed to allow Israel more time to complete the
withdrawal, which will take until at least February 1997.
PLO spokesman Marwan Kanafani said the agreement was ''an advance''.
Israel has already agreed to pull out of at least four West Bank towns
before the elections to choose a Palestinian authority. Under the
agreement, Israel will then withdraw troops from other parts of the West
Bank in three six-month stages.
The two sides have yet to decide on the date for the elections, but
are pushing for them to be held in December.
Chief Palestinian negotiator Ahmed Korei said that Arafat had accepted
Israel's proposal on the timing of a staged troop redeployment after
Palestinian elections.
''We agreed yesterday that redeployments after elections will take
place every six months instead of (the Palestinian proposal of) three,''
Korei told reporters. Arafat and Peres held five hours of talks
yesterday.
Peres said the agreement still left uncertain the date for the final
withdrawal.
Israel had wanted the pullout to be completed by July 1997 while the
PLO is demanding it be completed by February 1997.
The concession still left a host of problems to be solved, among them
water rights and security arrangements.
''We are still very far apart on the water issue and other issues
concerning redeployment and security arrangements,'' said PLO negotiator
Jamil Tarifi before Arafat met Peres today.
''We still have obstacles and hope that we have the ability to jump
over all of them and to reach a suitable conclusion,'' Arafat told
reporters after returning from a meeting in Alexandria with with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
Palestinians said Israel had agreed during recent talks with the PLO
to withdraw from six main Palestinian towns and 400 of the West Bank's
450 villages and to hand them over to the PLO ahead of elections.
But Israel wants to retain control of some 40 villages located near
Jewish settlements and around Arab East Jerusalem. The area that would
stay under Israeli control, labelled on a map used by negotiators as
area C, comprises about 65% of the West Bank.
Korei said Israeli army redeployment from area C would start after
Israel and the PLO set a date for elections for a governing council and
would be carried out in three stages, six months apart.
Meanwhile in Israel, hundreds of Jewish settlers opposed to peace
moves with the PLO scuffled with police and blocked traffic at various
sites around the country.--Reuter.

FOR more than a century, the game of rugby union has been governed by
the all-encompassing Declaration of Amateurism. It appears in bold print
on the first page of the Laws of the Game.
It declares:''The Game is an amateur game. No-one is allowed to seek
or receive payment or other material reward for taking part in the
Game.''
For too long now, great swathes of the game have paid only lip-service
to that first, guiding principle. The game has become besmirched by
hypocritical shamateurism.
The blind-eye posture adopted by the administrators -- a stance that
would have put Lord Nelson to shame -- has allowed the game to become
prey to the likes of media moguls Rupert Murdoch and Kerry Packer. The
International Rugby Football Board was, and perhaps still is, in
imminent danger of losing control of the sport which it administers.
Yesterday, at a momentous Murrayfield news conference, the Scottish
Rugby Union provided its answer to the questions posed by the #350m
Murdoch TV rights deal in the Southern Hemisphere -- a deal which has
acted as spur in the headlong rush towards unfettered and unregulated
professionalism -- by announcing that it was to embrace the concept of
professionalism with contracts for as many as 50 of Scotland's top
players.
The promise is of, as yet, unspecified amounts of cash which could be
around the #35,000-a-season talked about in Scotland, but unlikely to
match the #130,000, one-year deal which All Black captain Sean
Fitzpatrick said yesterday he has been offered by the New Zealand RFU,
courtesy of the Murdoch war-chest.
The SRU position was outlined by SRU International Rugby Football
Board representative Freddie McLeod, and it takes the form of the
submission which the Union will place before the IB when it meets in
Paris for three days at the end of the month.
There is little doubt that the Scottish blueprint, or something very
close to it, will be adopted as policy by the board, which has had its
deliberations on the amateurism issue brought into sharp focus by the
Murdoch deal and by the hazy proposals for a global rugby circus
bankrolled, it is said, by Murdoch's arch rival, Kerry Packer.
McLeod declared yesterday: ''There is clearly a situation where there
is a desire to move towards a professional game, or at least a game
where there is a payment for playing in addition to all the other
benefits already available. It would appear from the information that we
have been able to glean so far that this is directly proportional to the
status of the particular nation in world rugby.
''For example, it is clear that New Zealand is advocating a totally
open professional sport whereas at the other end of the scale, countries
such as Argentina and Japan would much prefer that the sport remain
totally amateur.''
He added: ''The Scottish Rugby Union is greatly concerned that the
meeting of the Board in Paris later this month might not come to a firm
conclusion and is perceived to be fudging the issue again. It is
strongly recommended that positive proposals are put in place with
enforcable controls, and that these should be implemented as soon as
possible.''
On those already in employment, he added: ''Inevitably players will
now require to be under contract and this will undoubtedly present some
difficulties. Many existing employers will not accept that an employee
can have two contracts.
''Additionally, those in the services and the police force would not
be permitted under any circumstances to enter into a second contract
which has onerous commitments. There will have to be two contracts, one
for those already in employment and the other for those who are not.''
The SRU envisages the international squad, and perhaps even the A
squad -- around 50 players in total -- would be put under contract by
the Union. They would then become eligible for payment which would be
routed through a trust fund administered by the Union.
The contracts would be ''graded,'' with not every player receiving the
same amount. In addition, the players would still be able to earn money
from off-field activities such as personal appearances as is the case
just now. However, they would have contractural obligations to promote
the game on the Union's behalf.
Paying the players will obviously place a financial burden on the SRU.
However, to some extent, the hand of the SRU -- and all other unions --
has been forced by the realities of the game worldwide where illicit
payments are rife.
McLeod said that if the SRU position is adopted as policy by the board
later this month, all areas of sponsorship would have to be re-examined.
''We have to review our whole commercial strategy. There are only a
limited number of additonal sponsorship opportunities available and we
are going to have to look at all aspects. We are going to have to --
regrettably in some people's mind -- look at the jersey.
''It is a source of revenue in some sponsors' minds if they have a
name on the jersey. We have to look at boot deals and look at how that
could be more individually beneficial to players, but controlled through
the Union.
There is the possibility that the decision to pay international
players could have a knock-on effect at club level. This was something
which McLeod acknowldged and he said: ''We have to take the clubs with
us because the clubs at the end of the day are the union.''
He was unable to put a figure on what internationalists might
earn:''The figure of #35,000 has been mentioned -- not by me I hasten to
add -- and all that I can say is that the figure will be nearer #35,000
than the #130,000 mentioned in New Zealand.''
The SRU, he said, would pay only what it could afford. It would be
folly to do otherwise.
THE BLUEPRINT
* The word ''amateur'' to be removed from the law-book.
* International squad players and, perhaps, A team players, placed
under contract to the Union.
* Players to be paid as yet unspecified amounts, but in line with what
the Union can afford. #35,000-a-season more realistic than the #130,000
which top New Zealand players have been offered by the NZRFU.
* Contracted players will have to carry out promotional work on the
Union's  behalf.
* Grading players with rewards commensurate on status.
* Players still able to earn additional cash for off-field activities.
* Three categories of player -- professional, semi-professional and
non-professional.
* Possibility of international jersey sponsorship.
* Career advisory service for retired internationalists.
* All earnings through Union administered Trust fund with accounts
submitted to  International Board.
* Professional situation at district, provincial and, even, club level
deserves examination on global basis.
* Players found to be earning outwith official Trust funds face ban.

THE Scottish Rugby Union's decision on their three-tier system to
embrace professionalism changes everything, I can tell you.
Kevin McKenzie, the Scotland hooker, referred to the good Lord above
when I told him of the SRU's desire to abolish the word amateur. His
reaction, expletives deleted, read something like: ''I'm very surprised.
Everyone knew that they had to do something, but professional rugby? I
never thought they would go that far. I wonder where all of the money is
coming from. What will it do to grass roots rugby? I'll need to see the
full proposals.''
McKenzie, like most of his team mates, has a full-time job. ''The
World Cup showed that full-time rugby gives you the chance to get some
quality rest. It helped your performance. A sum like #35,000 is much
more than I earn, but I'd still like to work. I wouldn't give up my job,
but I am sure that some of the lads will,'' he said.
Scott Hastings, Scotland's experienced centre was similarly surprised:
''I wish I was 21 again. I must applaud the SRU, who have worked so well
with the players, and this is just another step on their enlightened
path. They must remember the value of the players, though. The World Cup
grossed #30m, and I did not see a penny of that.''
Hastings agreed with McKenzie that one consequence of the game turning
professional is that players inevitably will give up their careers. ''If
the SRU want us to set the standards needed from a winning team, then we
need the time to prepare properly. I think that many of the lads will
leave their jobs, but some will use the time to go into higher
education.''
The players' agent, Ian McLauchlan, has been in contact with the SRU
during their deliberations, meetings have taken place with their
International Board representative, Freddie McLeod, and he has argued
constantly that the ability of the players to negotiate their own
sponsorship and kit deals would generate far more money for them as
individuals than they receive at present from a payout from the trust
fund.
''The players stand to do much better on their own. The amount the
Union pays out on behalf of the major kit sponsors is relatively
small,'' said Audrey Smith of Ian McLauchlan Associates.
''Things like individual endorsements could be done. We would want the
players to be able to make a good living wage from the game, and if not
that, then an amount that would give them a good standard of living from
the combination of rugby and their jobs.''
Kenny Milne, Scotland's recently retired international hooker, reckons
that the Scottish players will want as much as overseas stars.
''I've heard the figure of #35,000 mentioned for our players, but if
we hear that the All Blacks are earning up to #100,000 each, then I'm
sure that the players will want to be paid similarly,'' he said.
''It is undoubtedly true that many of Scotland's top stars will now
give up their full-time jobs. I also hope that it means that a broader
spectrum of player is attracted to the game when they see that money can
be made.
''At the moment, little boys in Scotland idolise the likes of Ally
McCoist and Mark Hateley, but if rugby players reached that stage, then
I hope these lads are persuaded to join the sport. I think
professionalism can only be good for Scottish rugby.''
Kenny Logan, Scotland's left winger, and a farmer in Stirlingshire,
took time out to express his delight as well. ''That's good going. I
never expected it,'' he said. ''The Union had to look at the situation
and be realistic about it. It should bring in a lot more money for the
players.
The good Lord was referred to again. The two Stirling County boys were
in perfect harmony.

Raith Rovers 4, Gotu Itrottanfelag 0
THE sun shone down on Stark's Park last night when Raith Rovers
entered the European arena for the first time in their 112-year history.
It was a stirring occasion, even if the opposition was less than
illustrious.
A team from the Faroe Islands called Gotu Itrottanfelag, who shall
henceforth be referred to simply as Gotu with the cost of newsprint what
it is, lined up against Raith, but there was no match at all.
Fourth in the Faroe Island league they may be, and this is their third
tie in European competitions making them vastly more experienced than
Raith, but the night belonged to Kirkcaldy. The town had waited too long
for their moment, and a collection of farmers, fishermen, and shepherds
were never going to deny them.
Raith, in fact, were so stimulated by the occasion that family units
would not be allowed to get in their way either. Gotu had playing for
them three Justinussens, and a trio from the family Jarnskor.
The Stark's Park side had one Dair, a single Rougier, a McAnespie, and
only one Cameron, but they were plenty. They scored the goals which will
be sufficient to see Raith safely into the first round proper of the
UEFA Cup.
Raith's players won't dare look too far ahead of themselves, but
no-one will be able to curb the dreams of their fans. The dusty old
stadium was given life by a 5082-strong crowd who had been anticipating
this night ever since the Coca Cola Cup final win over Celtic last
November.
They won credibility, admiration, money, and a shiny cup that day last
year. But last night brought them their real prize. Until then, Raith's
fans and almost all of their players, had only heard others talk of the
special atmosphere generated on European nights, and now they know for
themselves.
Now they will demand more of the same, but with Jim McInally, who made
his debut for Raith last night, holding the midfield together and
offering others the benefit of his wealth of experience, and the
adverturous play of Julian Broddle, allied to the lively work of Stephen
Crawford and Colin Cameron, this modest little team could fare all
right.
Jimmy Nicholl has been too long in the business to believe a tie can
be won and lost at the halfway stage and he would say only that his
players have ''given themselves a good chance of going through''.
The Starks Park manager added: ''I felt we should have had more than
one goal from the first half and at times it was like watching a pinball
machine, but I always believed the goals would come if the players
persevered.''
From the beginning, Gotu were put under severe pressure but managed to
hold out until 21 minutes when Jason Dair scored into an empty net from
close range. Tony Rougier managed to prod the ball across the face of
the goal despite the attention of Gotu's captain, Simun Justinussen, and
when the ball arrived in the middle, Dair had the simplest of tasks.
Raith ought to have been comfortably ahead by the interval, but some
poor finishing and a post denied them. However, a minute into the second
half, Rougier, signed last season from Trinidad &amp; Tobago side Trinity
Pros for a nominal fee, headed in a perfect cross by Broddle, who also
supplied the delivery for Raith's fourth, scored by Cameron in 81
minutes. Before that Stephen McAnespie scored with a tremendous 20-yard
free kick which beat Gotu's keeper Jens Knudsen at his top right-hand
corner.
RAITH ROVERS: Thomson, McAnespie, Broddle, McInally, Dennis, Sinclair,
Rougier, Cameron, Crawford, Taylor, Dair. Substitutes -- Graham, Coyle,

A POTENTIAL Scotland strike-force of Ally McCoist, Scott Booth and
Eoin Jess was left out of the Scotland squad named yesterday by
international team manager Craig Brown for next week's match against
Greece.
''There is no way I was prepared to risk going into this game without
players who are l00 per cent fit,'' said Brown. ''Any doubts at all were
enough to make me leave them out.
''There was a temptation to pick McCoist, and there would have been an
even greater temptation if he had managed to play a full game. But he
has not played a full 90 minutes in the last year.
''It would have been foolhardy of me to risk anyone in that position.
I had hoped the two Aberdeen lads would have played more often, but they
haven't and so there was no way I would take a chance on them.
''Even Bryan Gunn has been left out because he has not played often
enough for my liking.''
Brown has brought back other players who underwent operations in the
summer, or even earlier . . . but only those who have convinced him of
their readiness for the crucial game against the Greeks at Hampden next
week.
Skipper Gary McAllister, defender Colin Hendry, midfielder Stuart
McCall, striker Duncan Ferguson and goalkeeper Andy Goram all faced
surgery and all have recovered.
Goram is one who hands Brown a dilemma. But the manager welcomes that
one, because he believes that in the Ibrox man and Hibs veteran Jim
Leighton he has two men of international quality.
He emphasised that yesterday when he admitted: ''It could be a toss-up
between these two for the goalkeeping position. I have spoken to Alan
Hodgkinson at length about the two players and Alan is the most widely
respected goalkeeping guru of them all.
''We are in agreement of the way to go in this game, but I won't be
saying anything publicly until I have told the lad who is being left
out. I have Andy Goram back at his best, which makes him one of the top
keepers in Europe in my book, and I have Jim leighton, who has played
six games in succession and lost just one goal, a penalty against
Ecuador in Japan.
''Whoever plays, I know we will have a class act in goal.''
Brown knows what is at stake in this clash. Victory would almost
assure Scotland of a place in the European Championship finals in
England next summer. It would certainly end Greek interest in the
tournament.
Says Brown: ''It is their last chance, so they will be up for this
one. But so will we. Every player I have spoken to is excited and
determined that we will win.
''Look, we are a better team than Greece. We can win this one and I
believe we will. If we don't, then it will be because they have played
better than us on the night, but I am not even thinking of defeat.''
The one disappointment Brown admits to is the loss of Paul McStay for
this game and for the next one against Finland next month.
''Last season he was superb on our opening games and I would have
liked him to be available for this one,'' he says. ''But we have Gary
McAllister buzzing again and we have John Collins playing magnificently,
so that eases the problem.''
The goalkeeping position apart, Brown has just one other worrying area
and that is up front, where he must decide on a new playing partnership
in the department which will be asked to deliver the goals that will
give Scotland victory.
Hearts striker John Robertson was almost the forgotten man of Scottish
soccer because his name was omitted from the team sheet handed out to
the press. Explained Brown: ''It was my mistake in the office, but John
was always in our plans and his club were informed of that before the
squad was announced.''
Other than these two worries, he says, ''I know the rest of the team.
I know who I intend to play and how I intend to play. I am not
interested in anything other than a win from this game.''
So far it seems that 27,000 tickets have been sold for the match and
with a Hampden capacity of 37,000 there is a chance of the game coming
close to the sell-out Brown and his players want.

Motherwell 1, MyPa-47 3
IT WAS not a pretty sight, unless your auntie comes from Finland.
Scotland's premier-division runners-up were left floundering in the wake
of a Finnish side whose name has not quite resounded around the
Continent.
The consequence is a massive, virtually impossible, task facing
Motherwell when they try to retrieve their UEFA Cup ambitions for this
season, even before this season has begun, in Anjalankoski.
Keeper Steve Woods won't count last night as one of his best but, when
your own fans among the crowd of 8280 boo you, there is not much chance
of confidence being restored after a couple of errors.
It is also true that the Finns are maybe a decent side in anybody's
league but when all of that is taken into account, Motherwell still let
themselves down badly.
Yet they had been given the benefit of a great start, scoring in just
nine minutes. It was all downhill afterwards, with the Finns equalising
shortly after and scoring twice more to put themselves in perfect shape
for the return of this preliminary round tie in two weeks' time.
Once the initial bumping and bashing was spent, the pattern began to
take shape, with MyPa happy to sit back and hit on the break.
They were taken completely unaware, however, when Motherwell scored,
and it was another Dutchman, Mitchel van der Gaag, who caught them out.
He sent in the most measured of passes, from all of 60 yards, over the
Finnish defence where Tommy Coyne did well to tame the ball with his
head then cut it back to Shaun McSkimming, who had an easy job to head
home.
That seemed to set the Scottish side fair but they tossed away the
advantage that goal had gained them within three minutes.
A cross into the middle seemed harmless enough, but Niclas Gronholm
nipped in, rounded Brian Martin, and chipped the ball over Woods and
into the net.
Mothwerwell then lost another goal just after the half-hour mark that
they will not wish to recall readily. No real danger seemed imminent
when van der Gaag lost the ball to Kolkka, whose short pass to Tiainen
was fully 22 yards out but the striker's left-foot shot beat Woods at
the near post.
The Finns replaced Pohja with Keskitalo at the start of the second
half which was only a minute old when Chris McCart was booked for foul
on Mahlio.
In 53 minutes 'Well had to replace the injured Lambert with Billy
Davies, whose first sight of the ball was as it lay in the back of his
team's net.
A corner from the right was headed out but there was Mahlio all alone
and with enough time to tame the ball, touch it forward, and, from just
outside the box, smash it low into the net through a corridor of
players.
Van der Gaag, Eddie May, and Toni Huttenen all had their names taken
before Davies should have earned a goal of his own when he hit a 30-yard
chip that beat the keeper but hit the bar.
Motherwell manager Alex McLeish was realistic enough in his assessment
afterwards. ''They just grew in confidence after we gifted them the
first two goals. And it means we have a gigantic mountain to climb.
''We can make hundreds of excuses but they worked very hard and that
came from the confidence. We looked tired and sluggish whereas they had
composure.''
He refused, in time honoured fashion, to be entirely pessimistic,
adding: ''I will take some consolation from the fact that they seem to
be better away from home and if Dougie Arnott is available I believe he
will cause them problems.''
Finnish manager Harri Kampman said: ''Our discipline was at the
highest level and we counter-attacked like cobras. I am proud of my
players but we are not there yet and I know Motherwell will be stronger
in two weeks' time.''

THE need to edit out some of the purple passages from my article on
the immigration rules has led to the text being amended in such a way as
to cause an incorrect statement of the law (August 4).
Rule 41 (vi) requires an applicant for entry clearance to ''maintain
and accommodate himself and any dependants adquately out of resources
availabe to him without recourse to public funds or taking employment .
. . ''
The edited version of my article gives the impression that ''it is
impossible for anyone to underwrite a visitor's travel and accommodation
expenses -- which creates difficulties when Pakistani custom obliges the
host to defray all the visitor's costs''.
What I intended to convey in the text of my original article was that
someone of limited resources seeking entry clearance to enter the United
Kingdom as a visitor was not automatically debarred by their lack of
funds.
Sub-clause (vi) above quoted makes it clear that the sponsor in the
United Kingdom of the visitor, who may be any member of family or friend
who can provide the funds, can enable someone to come to this country
and maintain themselves independently.
It is therefore wrong for an entry clearance officer (as happened in
one of the instances recounted in my article) to refuse someone's
application because they did not personally have enough money for the
ticket and for their holiday expenses.
Indeed, Asian rules of family hospitality would make it unusual for a
visitor to the United Kingdom to have to spend much money of their own.

J F MONTGOMERIE has much to learn about socialism (July 29). Socialism
or communism has never existed in any state political form, therefore it
has never failed.
Before his death in 1924, Lenin was freely describing the provisional
existing economy of the Soviet Union as state capitalist, albeit of a
different variety from that which had operated in capitalist states
during the war period.
The Stalinist bureaucratic nightmare was built upon the earlier
temporary new economic policy which was waiting hopefully on European
revolution which never came.
That Mr Montgomerie should equate politics only with consumerism is
highly surprising and is indicative of the depth of capitalist
corruption.
Socialism has never existed here either, whether in town hall or
Westminster. The Labour Party leadership has never been socialist, in
contrast to millions of its supporters who expected it to take them
forward to the co-operative commonweath. Certainly, the present bunch
are now no longer a Labour Party.
Capitalism exists by exploiting the ''labourers''. When the latter
take over political and productive power world-wide, then this will be
the beginning of socialism. Capitalism will simply cease to exist in a
global society in the hands of the workers.

THE British Government is an accessory in the war crime of genocide
being perpetrated in Europe right now.
We have encouraged, armed, and defended the Croat racists at Germany's
behest. Our Government knew that the current genocidal attack on Krajina
was being prepared, as indeed did any journalist reporting on
ex-Yugoslavia. Our Government refused to lift a finger to prevent this
attack before it started and is still refusing to take any action to
halt the killing.
More worryingly, the sophistication of the Croat attack could not have
been achieved by an army so recently built from a home-grown militia.
For example, the campaign started with a massed concerted night attack,
always one of the most difficult manoeuvres in warfare. At the very
least some Nato member(s) must have been controlling their staff work.
During the last war the Germans, with some help from local fascist
thugs, killed more than two million Yugoslavs. This is one-third of the
number of Jews killed throughout Europe by the fascists and was thus a
substantial part of the total Holocaust.
Today the Serbs are fighting only for their own freedom and safety.
They do not seek one foot of land primarily inhabited by any other
group, though news management in this country tends to gloss over that
fact.
Yet these brave and independent people, who sacrificed so much with us
in the two world wars, have been bombed, starved and insulted by our
Government merely for defending their homes.
In the name of peace we bombed Serb mortar positions and munition
dumps. Now the Croats are using regiments of very heavy artillery,
hundreds of times more effective than infantry mortars, and incidentally
particularly vulnerable to air power.
If Britain, Nato or the UN are to retain the smallest shred of
decency, integrity, or honour they must now act to save the people of
Krajina and re-establish the UN ceasefire lines.
We can stop this massacre any time we wish. It is too late to rebuild
Yugoslavia, her enemies have done their bloody work too well, but a
lasting peace can be built on the principle that boundaries be drawn on
national lines.
The boundaries claimed by the Croats and Bosnian Muslims reflect
nothing more than the prejudices of dead emperors and foreign
politicians. In a civilised world states should be built to fit people,
not people killed to make states more homogeneous.

THERE are a series of visually attractive and rather clever television
and poster adverts running at the moment, drawing attention to the
virtues of Northern Ireland as a holiday spot. The aim of the campaign
is to tempt Scots to Northern Ireland just at the moment when the
Scottish tourist industry is awaiting the surge of Bravehearts from
North America. Both campaigns deserve to be successful.
''You'll never know unless you go'' is the tag line on the Northern
Irish advertisements, and two weeks ago, as I came through the Glens of
Antrim on my way back from speaking at the John Hewitt Summer School, it
struck me as just the right way of drawing attention not just to the
glorious Northern Ireland landscape, but also to the distinctive Irish
tradition of gathering in the summer in search of learning, culture, and
entertainment.
Mention summer schools in Scotland and you'll only get a reaction if
you happen to be talking to an Open University student. Hidden away from
the rest of us, OU students spend a week or a fortnight each year in
intensive study away from home -- a chance actually to talk face to face
with other students, hear lectures in a real lecture theatre, and
socialise until the wee small hours. To participate in, in other words,
all the things that students normally do.
But that is about the limit of Scottish summer school experience. In
Ireland it is a different story. Visit any village in the Gaeltacht at
this time of year and you will notice immediately throngs of young
people on every street corner. These are students, normally from
English-speaking homes, who are sent for three weeks to Irish-speaking
areas to improve their knowledge of what is one of Ireland's official
languages. These courses are underwritten by the state, and there are
good incentives for local people to provide accommodation in
Irish-speaking households.
The effect of these courses on rural, marginal areas has been
considerable. Many local people have built new houses to provide
accommodation for students during the summer. The presence of a living
Irish language community has attracted tourism both from Irish adults,
who are also keen to learn, and from elsewhere. The summer schools
themselves have managed to establish buildings which can be used by the
community during the winter -- with a range of lectures, arts events,
and meetings of community organisations being held.
And the effect on the language has been strong too. Certainly Irish
has declined in this century, but where it is strengthened by an influx
of students it remains the living vital heart of the community.
Adults too get a look in. The summer school at which I spoke was only
one of many being held throughout Ireland. They have a variety of
themes, with the bulk being devoted to literary or cultural agendas. The
best known is the annual Yeats Summer School at Sligo, in the shadow of
Ben Bulben and that memorial stone that gives the chilling advice --
Cast a cold eye on life, on death/Horseman pass by!
The John Hewitt Summer School I attended commemorates the Northern
Irish poet, believer in federalism and celebrator of all good things.
This year's theme was ''Celts and Saxons'' and under that umbrella the
strong link that Northern Ireland has to Scotland was explored,
dissected, argued about, celebrated, and at times despaired of!
My own contribution on ''Nothern Ireland and the Scottish Question''
was part of a lively wide-ranging debate with a quality of audience
participation that is rare in Scotland. Just as we know only what we are
told in the media about the reality of Ireland and its problems and
possibilities, so in Northern Ireland there was a general lack of
detailed knowledge about Scotland and the issue of its constitution. But
there was a very strong link in the passionate belief in the virtues of
civic nationalism and the way in which such nationalism could and should
make a productive contribution to the future of both our countries.
These summer schools allow all those present to make links, and to
make friendships. Poets and politicians have more in common that either
chooses to believe but it took a trip to a summer school in Northern
Ireland for me to meet Iain Crichton Smith, one of our most
distinguished poets in both Gaelic and English, and to enjoy his
infectious sense of hunour, and his profound commitment to Scotland.
It would be too much to expect that the present Government would have
the vision to learn from the Irish experience and to invest a little in
encouraging the development of summer schools in Scotland. In
Gaelic-speaking areas modest tax incentives and a small amount of
funding in administration could provide a Scottish version of the Irish
language schools, and enhance the work of those in television, radio,
and education who are trying hard to save the language. The same
cultural and economic stimulus could be provided in Scots and
English-speaking rural areas too and provide a new source of income for
areas on the edge.
For adults a range of summer schools well advertised and well
organised could enrich our cultural life and provide outlets and
opportunities for those whose horizons are narrow enough for the rest of
the year. We could make a start by asking some of the Irish organisers
to lend us a hand, and for some ideas, to get us under way.
But this year, as each hot summer day succeeds the next, I suspect
that we would need some persuading to pack our bags and set off for a
summer school. It sounds too much like hard work, too much like the
''improving''activity that our parents always seemed to want us to
undertake, when we, as summer children, wanted only to play in the
sunshine.
But we should try, for, as I've now discovered, ''You'll never know
unless you go!''

Kilmarnock 0, Blackburn 5.
ENGLISH Premiership champions Blackburn Rovers ruined Killie's
celebrations to open their new stadium with a five-star display.
Mike Newell took only three minutes to silence the home fans when he
rose unchallenged to head Alan Shearer's cross into the top right hand
corner.
And with only nine minutes on the clock, Blackburn notched their
second, Atkins running clear into the box and firing a low drive beyond
Lekovic's reach.
Colin McKee spearheaded a home breakaway, but his attempt at beating
Mimms at the near post was thwarted by the keeper.
Former Dundee United player Kevin Gallagher might have netted a third
after 35 minutes but his snap shot flew just wide of the goal.
Blackburn ended the half with a cracking Shearer header, but Lekovic
pulled off a super save to deny the England striker.
But Shearer needed only five minutes of the second half to show his
class, curling a 30-yard free-kick into the top left-hand corner.
After 57 minutes the Shearer-Newell double act struck again, with the
latter grabbing his second and his side's fourth goal with a tap-in.
On the hour mark Blackburn took off Scotland defender Colin Hendry and
replaced him with striker Chris Sutton.
Killie almost snatched a consolation goal when both Paul Wright and
Tom Brown hit the crossbar. Then Mimms denied Tom Black.
But it was the visitors who struck again two minutes from time when
Shearer burst through the home defence and blasted in number five.

WEATHER conditions over the next four or five weeks will be critical
for the potato crop, the Potato Marketing Board said yesterday. High
temperatures and very dry conditions have already affected many second
early crops and rain is now badly needed in most areas.
Some growers, keen to start harvesting second earlies, are finding
yields not high enough to justify this.
''If this weather continues it is likely to have a severe effect on
maincrop varieties -- particularly those not irrigated -- and reduce
overall yield,'' said a board spokesman.
As a result, growers have become more confident on price prospects for
the coming season. However, the hot weather has also curtailed potato
consumption, making sales in any quantity hard to secure.
By the end of July growers were reported to be lifting early crops
according to market requirements and the month finished on a steady
trend with average prices of #90 a tonne.
The Seed Potato Development Council is to continue in existence for a
further two years, after which its future will be reviewed, the Earl of
Lindsay, Scottish Office Agriculture Minister, has announced.
His decision follows the statutory five-year review of the council and
consultation with industry bodies in Scotland.
Lord Lindsay said the situation would become clearer towards the end
of 1997 as a successor body evolved to take over some of the
responsibilities of the Potato Marketing Board. Scottish growers would
be able to judge in due course whether their interests, particularly in
the seed sector, were best served in a GB context or by the SSPDC.
The council was established in 1981 with a remit to promote and
develop the market for Scottish seed potatoes at home and abroad.
The disbanding of the marketing board and abolition of potato quotas
would lead to a return of peaks and troughs in profitability, forecast
Michael Lamyman of surveyor Knight Frank &amp; Rutley's farms department.
Last year, he said, potato crops across Europe fell short, resulting
in astronomical price rises. British growers, after three years of poor
returns, enjoyed both reasonable yields and high prices.
''It was common for net margins to exceed #3000 an acre and it was no
surprise that many new clients who retained us to buy farms were potato
growers,'' he said.
The ending of quotas would make it relatively easy for farmers to move
in and out of the sector, he added.
While record temperatures in July have led to a drop in potato
consumption and a 40% fall in prices, Mr Lamyman predicted a healthy
recovery in price, stemming from reduced yields caused by the drought.
Growers who have been able to irrigate their crops will benefit greatly,
he said.
In the longer term he foresees only two sorts of producer surviving.
One will be farmers who minimise the risks involved by growing other
cash crops. The other will be professional producers, heavily geared to
potato production, prepared to invest in irrigation, cold store
facilities and other modern equipment, and capable of regularly
achieving high yields of good quality potatoes.

4) must be condemned by all decent people in Scotland.
Mr Henderson never tires telling us of his role in defending the
''ethos and traditions'' of Britain during the war. It is evident that
he does not include freedom of speech among them. He virtually ignores
the subject matter of Mr Maan's writings about ethnic cleansing by the
Serbs, and launches an overtly racist attack on him and (by implication)
all other Scottish Asians.
Bashir Maan is a citizen of Scotland who for many years has worked
diligently to foster harmony and peace. How dare Mr Henderson tell him
to shut up or go home.

A 22-month-old baby boy -- brain damaged in the womb and cannot hear,
see, or control his movements -- is in a legal battle for his life
(August 1).
What sort of life, if you can call it life, is he living?
His parents, Fiona and Con Creedon, have every right to ask for their
little fellow to be allowed to die and no longer suffer.
The heartbroken parents are thinking only of their baby and they must
be the ones to decide.

THE article on global warming raises a number of points which might
benefit from clarification (August 2).
From a parochial viewpoint the warmest decades in the 125-year Glasgow
record were the 1940s and 1950s, if most months of the year are
considered (although cold winters were common), followed by a
significant decline in the 1960s.
There has been a recovery since but there is still some way to go to
reach the levels of 50 years ago.
It is important to point out that not all months and seasons behave in
the same way. July is catching up well, with five of the 10 warmest in
the Glasgow record occurring since 1980, but other months are lagging.
It is clear that the problem is anything but simple, with variations in
time and space.
How do we define global warming anyway? Dr Jones' comment about
''natural fluctuations'' is valid. It seems likely that warming has
already taken place following the colder seventeenth to nineteenth
centuries, the so-called ''little ice age''.
The main concern now seems to be whether further warming will occur
and, if so, how much. In this context Dr Jones is right to express
caution.
Another interesting aspect of our recent weather in the West of
Scotland has been an increase of about 20% in rainfall over the past 15
years or so.
By the way, your correspondent has fallen into the error of connecting
the hole in the ozone layer with global warming. The hole does not
contribute to global warming, although some of the pollutants which are
destroying the ozone layer may also be responsible in part for global
warming.

JACK McLean's comments about domestic violence in his piece of August
4 are total drivel. He grotesquely downplays the abuse some women suffer
for years on end.
Of course taking your husband's life if wrong, but the law is not
''suborned'' by looking at past circumstances -- it is normal procedure
and called justice. The idea that women will head for the kitchen drawer
in view of our present law is just silly.
Jack McLean should get back to what he does best -- winding people up
and knocking harmless old dears like the Queen Mum. He does not need to
be ''apologetic for having a sticky-out bit'' -- a few inches off his
column will be fine!

FALKIRK yesterday moved to re-establish some stability at the club by
announcing the appointment of John Lambie in succession to Jim
Jefferies, who left for Hearts a week ago amid much controversy.
Lambie, whose association with Brockville chairman George Fulston
began in their days together at Hamilton, has been named technical
director of football at Falkirk and will take charge of the team and
also oversee the move to the new stadium.
Compensation has been agreed between Falkirk and Partick Thistle, even
though Lambie is not under contract at Firhill.
Fulston believes Lambie is the man to keep the club on an even keel
after the psychological blow the departure of Jefferies has
unquestionably dealt the club.
''I was determined to ensure we must have the right man for the job,''
said Fulston. ''We have got the go-ahead to build a new stadium and that
should be started before the turn of the year.''
Lambie, at 53, is not likely to be over-awed by the task that faces
him, but the double act at Brockville should be fascinating, considering
that Fulston once said: ''If John ever becomes manager of Falkirk I may
become the first chairman to strangle the manager.''
Their relationship is volatile, but based on a genuine mutual respect,
and at such a vital time in Falkirk's history Lambie is the man many
people feel fits the bill ideally.
With the departure of Lambie, Thistle are next in the domino line as
they try to find a manager. The names that will be bandied about will
include Alex MacDonald of Airdrie, Alex Smith of Clyde, and Tommy
McLean, the former holder of the Tynecastle manager's chair.
Meanwhile, the ramifications from the exit of Jefferies continue,
although Fulston was in more magnanimous mood about the negotiations to
take Jefferies' assistant, Billy Brown, to Tynecastle. ''Hearts have, in
my view, behaved more sensibly about the Brown situation and I expect
that to be settled quite quickly.
''However, unless they come back before the weekend with a new offer
of compensation for Jefferies that makes sense I will be putting all the
facts before the Scottish League.''

RANGERS could be on the verge of producing their greatest ever team,
according to Danish internationalist Brian Laudrup, who spoke yesterday
as the Scottish champions finalised their preparations for tonight's
clash with Anorthosis Famagusta.
The Cypriot champions, bolstered by a Bulgarian manager and three
Bulgarian players, are the barrier between the Ibrox side and the
Champions' League. They are the opposition in the preliminary round of
the European Cup and Laudrup acknowledges that before any real claims
can be made in Rangers' favour they must overcome this opening hurdle.
Laudrup, as always, talked with sense and with authority as befits a
man who has played at the very highest level in Germany and Italy as
well as his native Denmark before arriving to collect the Player of the
Year title in Scotland last season.
In the relaxing atmosphere of Turnberry, Laudrup looked back to his
days with Bayern Munich, Fiorentina, and AC Milan and then to the
current squad of players at Ibrox.
His verdict was simple, as he pointed out: ''On paper we have the
players at Rangers who could turn into a great European team. On paper
we are so much stronger than we were last season.
''Not only that, we have added players of great quality to the side
and that suggests that we will be able to do well in the European Cup.
Certainly, I think that if we can overcome the Cyprus team in this
preliminary round then we can go on to do very well in the Champions'
League.
''We have to prove that, of course. And we can only start to prove it
by winning against Anorthosis. That is so important for this club.''
Laudrup suffered deep disappointment when Rangers crashed out of this
same tournament against AEK Athens just a couple of months after the
great Dane had signed. Now he wants to turn things around.
The signs from the Ibrox camp are that they will begin to do so at an
intimidating sell-out Ibrox tonight. Forty-seven thousand fans will be
there, and while the Bulgarian coach, Georgi Vassilev, and three of his
fellow countrymen have been over the course before, even they admit that
the Ibrox side is more formidable than it was two years ago.
Part of that new, enhanced image comes from the partnership of Laudrup
and Paul Gascoigne, and the Dane points out: ''So far Paul has been
tremendous to play alongside. We are still working on our understanding,
but in every game it gets better.
''We can play with each other, there is no doubt about that, and the
more opportunities we have then the better we will become. But all round
the team is more confident than it was last season. When we played AEK
we had so many injuries and they continued during the season. That is
not the case this time. The pre-season training and games have been much
better and there are no worries over fitness. That is a major change
from last season.
''Still, we have to remember that this will be a difficult game. I
have been to Cyprus with Denmark and we drew 1-1 there. We have to try
to finish the tie in Glasgow and then we can, perhaps, go on to prove
how that we can become a great European side.''
First things first, though, is the view of manager Walter Smith. He
suffered the agony of a last-minute goal in Sofia -- and the scorer
Nikolai Todorov re-visits Ibrox with Anorthosis tonight -- and also the
defeat from AEK last season.
This time round he wants no slip-ups and his build-up has been
carefully thought out. It has also been successful in that Rangers won
their Ibrox tournament and performed well, their players are free of
injury and the ring of confidence is high around Ibrox. Defeat is really
unthinkable.
Smith must simply put out a team which will win the game comfortably
and not give away any silly goals which could cause them problems in the
heat of Cyprus in two weeks' time.
The prize is a place in the Champions' League and the challenge their
players and fans want. And at the same time, a passport to an #8m
bonanza.
The stakes are high, but the Scottish champions have invested heavily
in new players and are due a pay-off. I believe they will get that, and
their 47 thousand fans and the huge TV audience may get a glimpse of the
greatness Laudrup predicts.

YOU are, of course, correct in your leader (August 4) to point out
that European Monetary Union is probably, primarily, a political
question and not merely an economic one.
The difficulty, however, is that it is also an economic one, and that
the present running debate is so politically charged that the politics
is infecting the economics.
Those in favour of closer European integration for political reasons
naturally find themselves highlighting the economic case for EMU.
Politically-inclined Euro-sceptics equally naturally highlight the
economic downside. Both sides have tended to get things out of
proportion.
What we need, but sadly may not get, is first of all a cool-headed and
purely economic assessment of the pros and cons. That done, those with
political interests in the matter can get on with an informed and
undistorted argument, of which the economic case would be only a part.

Bolton 3, Aberdeen 1.
ABERDEEN gave few hints about who is likely to score goals for them
this season after a lacklustre display in their friendly at Bolton.
It was left to central defender John Inglis to head a consolation goal
for his side in the dying moments from a Stephen Glass corner.
The dull encounter had a sting in its tail with three goals in the
last three minutes.
Bolton's first came after 68 minutes when Mark Patterson touched a
free kick sideways, Alan Stubbs stepped over the ball and Alan Thompson
rifled in a fierce low shot which beat Theo Snelders from 25 yards.
Fabian De Freitas restored Bolton's lead after 86 minutes when he
headed home a Scott Green cross to start a goal rush.
Inglis moved forward to head Aberdeen's goal a minute later. But while
Aberdeen were still celebrating they were hit for a third time by
Bolton.
Jimmy Phillips swung the ball into the Aberdeen goalmouth for Owen
Coyle to head the ball into the net.
Bolton -- Branagan, Bergsson, Phillips, McAteer, Fairclough, Stubbs,
Patterson, Taggart (Green), De Freitas, Thompson, Coyle.
Aberdeen -- Snelders, McKimmie, Woodthorpe, McKinnon, Inglis, Smith,
Miller, Hetherston, Booth (Jess), Dodds, Glass.
Referee -- Mr J Parker (Preston).

SCOTTISH sheep farmers will be seriously affected if European Union
proposals for changes in the arrangements for payment of the Sheep
Annual Premium subsidy are implemented in their current form.
The new measures, designed to reduce the possibility of fraud, are
expected to be introduced next year when it is proposed that there
should be only one application/retention period. The existing two-period
system is seen as having potential for double payments in respect of the
same animal.
Stewart Whiteford, livestock convener for the National Farmers' Union
of Scotland, said: ''We are very unhappy but it looks like a total fait
accompli. There is little chance that we can do anything about it
despite our representations.''
In principle, the present system implemented by the UK agriculture
departments should prevent double payments but, officials point out,
rules are not always observed. The possibility for double payment occurs
when an animal which qualified for payment in the first period is sold
into a flock where a claim is lodged for the second.
Flock records are currently used as a means of verifying claims.
However, these deal in overall numbers rather than the movement of
individual sheep in or out of the flock. The control value is,
therefore, limited unless it is supported by documentation such as
invoices or receipts.
In future, if a farmer cannot produce a flock record showing the
required information at inspection, all SAP payments for the year in
question could be lost. This would apply even if the number of animals
on which a claim is made were actually present at the time of
inspection. The subsidy, paid on females, is expected to be about #21
this year.
Mr Whiteford said the proposed change could have a considerable effect
on Scottish sheep farmers with early lambing flocks, where it is common
to dispose of ewes as soon as the prime lambs have been sold. A January
lambing flock aiming at the premium Easter market would be hard hit if
it was not permitted to sell ewes and gain the subsidy at the same time
as the lambs were sold. There was also a big demand at that time of the
year from the Muslim community for ewes, for the feast of Ramadan.
For those who have been in the business of buying store ewe lambs
early in the season, and then selling them for slaughter in the new
year, there is the fear that they would have to hold on to them too
long.
At this stage no hard and fast decisions have been made on qualifying
dates, but the Ministry of Agriculture has been considering whether
applications should be made between December 4 and February 4. That
would mean a retention period running up to May 14.

''JOHN WILSON'', a pseudonymous Ayrshire GP, takes space in your
columns to whinge about how awful things are for him (Doctors with
miseries, August 3). I hope for the sake of his patients that he is
better at medicine than he is at presenting and arguing a rational case.
I am afraid that his article suggests that I hope in vain.
''Dr Wilson'' makes a remarkable prediction -- ''soon general practice
won't be there'' -- but offers only the most inadequate of evidence to
support it. He refers to 1990, the year of the new contract, as the
start of a new era, and, by implication, also the beginning of the end
of general practice, but goes on to say ''that problem was rapidly
overcome by the doctors''.
So there is no need to worry after all? Unfortunately, it then turns
out that impending doom is all the fault of the patients in asking for
unnecessary night visits. ''Dr Wilson'', like his colleagues, is long on
anecdote (what about doctor-patient confidentiality?) and short on
analysis.
After reading his article, some of your readers must be wondering
where other Ayrshire GPs get the time to act as police surgeons.
The facts are that even after the recent rise the average Scot
receives a night visit about once every 20 years, that the average GP in
Scotland makes only 73 such visits every year, and that GPs have
rejected an offer from the Government which would pay them the quivalent
of #96 per hour for time spent on such visits, in addition of course to
their basic salary and other payments.
''Dr Wilson'' refers to ''an arrogant government''. In reality it is
the GPs, scaremongering as they have done ever since they fought against
the formation of the NHS in the first place, who are the arrogant ones.
The Government's very tentative steps towards a patient-centred service
have provoked outrage that citizens have the temerity to behave as if
they have a right to the service they pay for.
''Dr Wilson'' tells us that he prescribed penicillin to six patients
who did not need it. The NHS would be much better off without the sort
of GP who, as well as being ''miserable and worried'', is recklessly
irresponsible, as cavalier with the facts as he is with his patients,
whom he so obviously dislikes.

CORDIANT, the renamed Saatchi &amp; Saatchi advertising group, struck a
distinctly discordant note with its first-half figures, showing a #29.6m
plunge into the red compared with profits of #15.3m, and a forecast of
lower revenue in the second half.
Much of the reported deficit reflected losses on disposals. Excluding
these the losses were more modest at #2.8m, with the group unsettled by
the highly public dispute with the firm's co-founder Maurice Saatchi
which led to his departure and the establishment of a rival agency.
The clash led to the loss of some high-powered clients such as Mars
(of bars fame), British Airways and Dixons. As chairman Charlie Scott
put it: ''These results reflect a particularly turbulent period for the
group. Our revenue and margin performance has been poor, particularly in
the US.''
Trading margins deteriorated from 5.7% to 4.8% as a result of a
particularly poor level in the US. Tackling this will be the priority of
Cordiant's new chief executive, Bob Seelert, who has long experience of
the US advertising scene. In the UK margins have recovered to a
respectable 13.4%.
The US revenue performance was worse than expected, and ways to match
cost and revenue are being considered. Second-half revenue will be lower
owing to the account losses.
Staff numbers are down from 10,900 to 10,350 and falling, with
redundancy charges of #10m expected for the full year.
Average net debt reduced only a little to #130m before a further
disposal which will bring in #13m. Cordiant shares were 2p off at 118p.

ERIC Cantona has added to Manchester United's pre-season woes by
asking to join the exodus of top players from Old Trafford.
The mercurial Frenchman made his request to club chairman Martin
Edwards yesterday -- as the Football Association asked United to explain
his appearance in a training match against a Rochdale side on July 25.
But the Old Trafford board -- already under fire for the close season
departures of Paul Ince, Mark Hughes and, subject to negotiation, Andrei
Kanchelskis -- have refused the request.
The FA will take no action against the club or player for his
appearance behind closed doors last month, accepting that it was not an
official match.
Cantona is banned from playing until the start of October after his
''Kung-fu-style'' attack on a Crystal Palace fan.
Spokesman Mike Parry said today: ''The FA received a response from
Manchester United in regard to our enquiry about Eric Cantona. We are
entirely satisfied with their explanation and we have conveyed that to
the club.''
Cantona made his request to be released from the three-year contract
he signed at the end of last season in a meeting with chairman Edwards.
United press officer Ken Ramsden said: ''Cantona was very upset at the
recent inquiry by the FA concerning his involvement in the training
session held on July 25.
''He told Martin Edwards that he had little future in the English game
and that his career would be best served by a move abroad. He asked to
be released from his contract.
''The board of Manchester United has considered the request very
carefully but is not prepared to agree to it.
''Manchester United believe that it is in the best interests of both
the club and the player that he remains with Manchester United.''
Nevertheless, a host of overseas clubs will be alerted by news of the
former France captain's request.
The Italian ''transfer window'' for the early part of the season has
passed, meaning anyone signed now could not play in Serie A until
November, but as Cantona is banned until October, that may not be too
big a stumbling block.
Inter Milan chairman Massimo Moratti has made no secret of his desire
to sign Cantona at the time of his #7m capture of Ince.
Moratti was quoted as saying: ''Eric Cantona is for me what Roberto
Baggio is to Silvio Berlusconi.''
Berlusconi subsequently signed Baggio for AC Milan and Moratti may now
feel the time is right to attempt a similar coup for his club.
Andy Walsh, spokesman for the Independent Manchester United Supporters
Association, said: ''Fans will be devastated by the news that Eric has
put in a transfer request. We hope the club will be able to persuade him
to stay.''
Walsh was critical of the FA for adding to the pressure on Cantona
with their recent inquiry.
''Cantona has been punished four times for his offence -- he was dealt
with by the courts, fined by the club, suspended by the FA, and stripped
of the captaincy by the French FA.
''It is time this was all put into perspective and Eric left to get on
with regaining his fitness.''

THE stated aim of the Social Focus on Women is to improve decision
making, to inform debate, and to stimulate research. This is a laudable
aim, if difficult to achieve acceptably. The problem with the
statistical approach is that it tends to throw up a multiplicity of
images, each lustred with the touch of science and mathematics and
therefore to be believed. The further problem with the statistical
approach is that many of these images can be contradictory. This is not
a criticism of statistics as such, but it does indicate the need to
apply a critical process to its findings. Thus it is with the very
worthy Social Focus on Women. As some of our writers have pointed out
this morning, the statistics appear to show that women are having a
rather good time of it. They live longer than men, they enjoy better
health, they have a variety of choices open to them as to lifestyle,
partner, and children, and they have greater freedoms than the women of
generations past.
Our writers have also noticed the contradictions, the lack of senior
job opportunities which reaches ridiculous heights in the fields of
education and health, the heavy preponderance of women as single
parents, and the stress and ill-health in certain areas and age goups
which threaten to undermine otherwise admirable health statistics.
The effect of all this is to bring us back to the original intention
of this statistical survey which was to provide a solid basis for debate
and research which, if it is worth anything at all, will lead to the
improvement of women's opportunities. This can only be achieved by
Government, by legislation, and by the recognition by even the dimmest
ideologue that there is such a thing as society and that action by the
state will always be needed to provide a framework in which it can
flourish.

THERE is nothing quite so pitiful as the sound of bubbling bookmakers,
wails of woe from the real kings of the turf, the guys who always make
sure the odds are in their favour.
No, I am not hitting out at Honest Sid or Bold Bert, the self-employed
on-course layers who are prepared to knock a point off here and there
when a decent wager is struck, but the monster office chains like
Ladbrokes and Hills, the ones always ready to squeal before they are
really hurt.
The big firms, you will recall, were in the vanguard of the movement
to introduce Sunday racing. It had to include, they insisted, off-course
betting, otherwise there was a danger of illegal betting. The thought of
that doesn't actually scare me rigid, but there we are.
Anyway, the compliant Government, always happy to help needy cases
like the big two, made it possible for their shops to be opened on the
Sabbath. And what has just happened? They have closed down again.
Ladbrokes now inform us that they are losing money on Sunday opening
and on Saturday evenings and are not keen to do it any more. That is a
big enough U-turn.
But to make matters worse, they have been leaning on the Satellite
Information Service -- the providers of a live television link to the
shops -- to shut down coverage of Sunday meetings.
If they big chains don't want to do it, no-one else should be allowed
to have a go.
Bravely, and wisely, SIS have resisted this attempt at a truly closed
shop policy, have kept faith with all their customers, and the pictures
are still being beamed. But, one wonders, for how long?
The big players in the bookmaking game are also crying about being hit
by the National Lottery -- they will be selling the Big Issue in their
shops next!
I am not at all shocked by the news that betting shops are losing
money on Sundays, it is of considerable surprise that they make a profit
on the other days . . . because they most certainly do not deserve to.
British punters, thanks again to the major bookmakers, are offered
pretty poor odds. It is not unusual for one horse to be quoted at 4/7
and another at even money. For an each-way bet, apart from in big races,
the return for a place is a fifth of the starting price -- another
rip-off.
Add to that the fact that should, by some miracle, a punter actually
pull off a coup which means a huge pay-off, the bookies are yelling
''fix'' before the nags are back in the stable. Public relations are
hardly their strong suit.
If Ladbrokes and Hills want to command the profits of yore, I suggest
to them they realise that they are in a buyers' market. Scratch cards
and lottery tickets can offer just as much fun to gamblers.
I campaigned for Sunday racing and it has to be voted a success. The
crowds at Ayr and the 35,000 who turned up at Chester the other week
simply underline the demand.
Of course, it means that some people's family life will be disrupted.
That is true of Sunday soccer, of athletics, of most golf tournaments,
including the Open Championship, which finish on that day. Racing will
have to learn to adjust to providing a service for its customers at
their convenience.
Racecourses have already seen the light. The new facilities at Ayr and
Musselburgh and the desire to involve everyone in the family by
providing peripheral attractions are paying off.
It is time the major bookmakers put their own house in order.

<HEADLINE>Guardian angel's appeal success.  Aberdeen businessman's generosity leads to sentence cut for the toilet duck robber.</HEADLINE>

AN Aberdeen businessman's generosity has led to a reduced jail
sentence for a debt-burdened man who tried to rob a shop with a toilet
duck lavatory cleaner.
Mr Donald Milne, who owns a North Sea oil service company, was so
shocked when he read of the three-year sentence handed down to Paul
Somerville, he offered to fund an appeal.
It is believed to have cost Mr Milne around #10,000, but yesterday his
kindness won Somerville a shorter stay in jail. His sentence was cut to
two years.
The former Norfolk County Council worker, whose case sparked a
petition for leniency signed by more than 400 people, is now expected to
be released in November or December, including time off for good
behaviour.
Mr Milne has told of why he had sympathy for Somerville. He said he
found himself in serious financial straits 15 years ago through
''silliness and mismanagement'' on his part, and could understand what
had driven Somerville to commit his crime.
''I lost what little money I had and was #80,000 in the red, which was
a hell of a lot of money at that time. What this guy did was very
similar,'' he said.
''But it has not helped him, or society, by giving him three years.''
Mrs Jo Somerville, 31, who lives with her two children, Nicole, three,
and two-year-old Joshua, at Blofield Heath, near Norwich, thanked Mr
Milne for his kindness as she celebrated her husband's reduced sentence.
She said Mr Milne had ''appeared like a guardian angel'' to help them.
Mr Milne read about the case after one appeal failed and made his
offer of legal funding, although he has never met the family.
Earlier, Mr James Tabor, QC, told the Court of Appeal, sitting at
Middlesex Guildhall Crown Court, how Mr Somerville, whose bank had
recalled his cheque book and stopped his standing orders when he ran up
debts of #8000, tried to raid the shop while still carrying his then
10-month-old son.
The court was told Somerville, described as shy and retiring, and who
had been of ''previous impeccable character'', snapped when his wife,
who knew nothing of the financial difficulties, asked him to go and cash
a cheque for #60.
Mr Tabor told the court: ''It was undoubtedly the fact that this man
was under very serious stress at that time.
''He was going to have to admit something that no man would find easy
-- that he had failed as a bread winner and as a father.''
The court was told the store owner, who was working alone, offered to
wash the child's comforter which had fallen on the floor. On returning
to the counter, Somerville had grabbed a bottle of toilet duck lavatory
cleaner from the shelf and shouted repeatedly ''get down on the floor''.
When she refused, Mr Tabor said his client ''squirted toilet cleaner
around the shop, some of which went on her'', before another customer
entered the shop and escorted Somerville outside.
''There is no dispute that he went completely berserk,'' said Mr
Tabor.
''He carried with him his baby on his hip and picked up a lavatory
cleaner from the shelf in his other hand. That is not the sign of a man
who sets out to carry out a pre-planned robbery.''
The #15,000-a-year white-collar worker pleaded guilty to attempted
robbery and was sentenced to three years imprisonment at Norwich Crown
Court in November.
But yesterday, Mr Justice David Keene said: ''We will quash the three
year sentence and substitute a sentence of two years imprisonment.
''To that limited extent this appeal succeeds.''
Mrs Somerville said: ''I am absolutely over the moon. I couldn't have
stood another Christmas without him.
''Now he should be out just after our 10th wedding anniversary, which
is on November 2.''
Mrs Somerville said a lot of people had been in contact to say the
sentence was unjust, but no-one had made a financial commitment such as
Mr Milne.
She added: ''In the same court, on the same day Paul was sentenced, a
man was up for attacking someone else who ended up having steel pins
fitted in his face. He got six months.
''My feelings towards Mr Milne are incredible. He has never set eyes
on any of us, yet he is prepared to do all this for us. It is just
wonderful.''
Mr Milne, 42, who runs Apex Tubulars in Aberdeen, was away from home
yesterday, but when news first broke of his generosity, earlier this
year, he said he felt embarassed at being cast in the role of
''do-gooder''.
He added: ''There are lots of genuine do-gooders all over the country.
I just happen to think that the one who gets should also give a little.
''I read about it on a flight abroad. Here was a picture of a guy with
a three-year-old kid on his arm who took a toilet cleaner to some
woman's head.''
Somerville had to be punished, ''but three years is absolute nonsense.
It is so blatantly unfair.''

THE barracudas are in a feeding frenzy. Disney has bought ABC for
$19bn, Westinghouse has bid $5500m for CBS, and now NBC has scooped the
sports jackpot by buying American rights to the 2000 summer Olympics and
the 2002 winter Olympics for $1270m. Rupert Murdoch has been pipped at
the post for once, so if he wants to maintain his position as the great
white shark of international media, he must move fast. Watch this space.
This is more than just the manoeuvrings of very large corporations.
There is a gale blowing through the
television/telecommunications/computer universe and when the winds
subside the giants will be even bigger and more powerful than they are
now -- and those that come out on top will be horrendously powerful. The
Republican majority in Congress favours this dispensation, and at the
moment the only barrier to the new monopolists is the shaky resolve of
President Clinton.
Fox television, controlled by Mr Murdoch, put in a preliminary bid of
$701m for the 2000 games. They are to be held in Sydney and Murdoch
wanted to carry them on Fox here and, no doubt, on BSkyB in Britain and
on his various other TV properties around the world. It would have been
a great coup, well worth the huge investment.
It was also expected that Disney-ABC would bid for the games.
Disney bought the network last week and hopes to spread around the
world by broadcasting children's programmes and sports; ABC owns the
cable sports network, ESPN, which reaches 60% of American homes and is
hugely popular. Just the place for the Olympics.
Perhaps ABC was too busy coping with the merger, which was sprung upon
it on July 31. Perhaps Murdoch thought that $701m was such a vast sum
(the Atlanta games, in 1996, went for $456m and the 1992 Barcelona games
for $409m) that no-one would top it. Or if they did, he would have the
chance to raise his own bid.
But NBC, which broadcast the games in 1980, 1988, and 1992, and will
do so next year, was determined to win the next games, and swept the
board by offering to buy the winter Olympics in the same enormous deal.
It was an offer the IOC could not refuse.
Meanwhile, Congress is chipping away at the restrictions on
monopolies. The House and Senate have produced different versions of the
Bill and President Clinton has been mumbling threats of veto, so the
final shape of the law has yet to be settled. But the key to it is that
TV networks will be allowed to expand and telephone companies and cable
companies will be able to enter each other's business.
For most Americans, all this is pretty arcane stuff. They will notice
that their cable bills and perhaps their phone bills will go up a bit,
at least to begin with, but it will be some time before the true
enormity of what has been allowed sinks in. American communications are
going to fall into the hands of three or four corporations.
In the old days there was a national telephone monopoly, AT&amp;T, the
largest company in the world. Now telephones are much more important
than they used to be, because of the role of computer networks, and
there will be a small number of corporations which not only control
telephones, but television as well. Information is power, and
information will be controlled by a handful of people.
They don't see it like that, of course. Murdoch, for instance, argues
that there is going to be such an explosion of TV channels, up to 500
within the next five years or so, that hinting at some sinister monopoly
is ridiculous. But it's not the number of channels that matters, it's
who controls access to them. By the end of the century they will all
come into houses and businesses through a little black box that also
controls the telephone -- and the computer networks that use those lines
will rule the world. Big Brother was not in the same league.
It's all very exciting for those who follow such things to wonder
which will prevail, the telephone or the cable companies. But in the end
it doesn't matter. The same sort of people will be in charge, whether it
is a merger of AT&amp;T, Microsoft and NBC, or Time-Warner (the cable
TV/entertainment conglomerate), or MCI (another telephone company) and
Fox.
What is more, these new companies will bestride the world.
First came Murdoch, starting with newspapers, magazines, and books,
but now spreading his television powers in every direction. Then NBC
went international, and no doubt Disney-ABC will follow suit.
I believe that this concentration of power is against the public
interest. That concentration is suddenly getting much greater in
America, where Congress is handing over the keys to the next century to
a few men whom most Americans have never heard of.

GLASGOW-based Shires High-Yielding Smaller Companies Trust (Shirescot)
under-performed the All-Share index in the first half of this year,
reflecting the general out-performance of its target stocks by their
larger counterparts.
Shirescot yesterday announced a 5.8% net asset value total return for
the six months to end-June, in line with the Hoare Govett Smaller
Companies index but adrift of the 9.1% return on the All-Share.
The Glasgow Investment Managers-run trust's net asset value rose 3.6%
to 149.9p, with the Hoare Govett index up 3.8% in capital-only terms and
the All-Share advancing 6.7%.
With the announcement of a second interim payout of 1.25p, interim
dividends to date are up 4.2% on last year at 2.50p. The total payout
for the year should be at least 5.7p.
The first quarter was the main period of under-performance by smaller
companies. During the second quarter, they began to close the gap from
their larger counterparts.
Glasgow Investment Managers' managing director, David Williams,
highlighted the narrowing of the discount at which Shirescot shares have
traded relative to net asset value, to 1.9% at end-June.
Pointing out that larger company investment trusts' discounts had
generally remained wider, Mr Williams said: ''That reflects the fact
that the market-place realises that the performance of smaller companies
is likely to improve. There is a greater interest in them again.''
The #29m fund aims for an overall return greater than that on the
All-Share, through income and capital growth, as well as a high yield.
During the six months, Shirescot's return was lower. However, between
its launch three years ago and end-June, the trust's nav total return
was 69.3%, compared with one of 66.4% on the All-Share.

RELY on Father Dan to make hay today while the sun shines at
Salisbury.
Gay Kelleway's six-year-old makes a quick reappearance after a
decisive success at Windsor on Monday.
Contesting an amateurs' handicap, Father Dan strode clear under Marcus
Armytage to trounce the in-form Carpathian by five lengths.
Kelleway is clearly wasting no time in taking advantage of Father
Dan's good form by declaring him for the H S Lester Memorial Challenge
Cup Handicap.
Although the gelding picks up a 6lb penalty, Kelleway has engaged
Richard Hannon's apprentice Dane O'Neill to take a valuable 7lb off his
back.
And the trainer must be pleased with the quality of the opposition --
or lack of it -- that will turn out.
Maiden Chocolate Charlie shoulders top weight, while Posing and
It'sthebusiness have also yet to win.
Queens Stroller is no great shake and while Bookcase has ability, he
needs to be covered up until the last moment, which could prove tricky
in this small field.
So Father Dan, a model of consistency, gets the nap vote to make it
two wins in three days.
Earlier, Surtees should open his account in the EBF Sandown Maiden.
Roger Charlton's colt caught the eye when sixth to Resounder on his
Newbury debut and he was subsequently sent off favourite for a
five-runner race at Newmarket.
He found Witch of Fife a length-and-a-quarter too good there but this
drop in grade should do the trick.
Another who steps down to lesser company is Faateq, who rates the best
bet on Beverley's card.
With Group 1 entries to his name, Faateq was made favourite on his
Sandown debut and looked the likely winner two furlongs out.
But lack of condition seemed to take its toll and he faded in the
closing stages to finish just under two lengths third to Oblomov.
Faateq should appreciate the Westwood's stiff 7[1/2]-furlongs and
could prove a different proposition this time.
Brian Meehan usually leaves a bit to work on with his juveniles. So it
would be no surprise to see Hartfields Boy come on enough for a run at
Windsor to take the Squash &amp; Fitness Centre Median Auction Maiden at
Sandown.

THERE was a moment yesterday which revealed what a celebrity Britain's
newly-crowned world triple jump champion has become, and hinted at what
his future holds.
During an interlude in the interminable series of interviews which
delayed him choosing his #40,000 Mercedes sports car, Jonathan Edwards
was mobbed by autograph-hunters.
As he signed obligingly, the other champion who emerged did not rate a
second glance -- yet it was Canadian Donovan Bailey, the man who has
succeeded Carl Lewis and Linford Christie as world 100 metres champion.
The 29-year-old Edwards had best acclimatised to the heated awe in
which he is held, having twice broken the world record, taking it
through the 18-metres barrier, and beyond 60 feet.
He is, quite simply, the star of the fifth world championships, and it
will take something very special to surpass him before the event closes
on Sunday.
The attendant riches and attention Edwards's new status heralds has
destroyed lesser men. Both his world records will bring bonuses from his
shoe sponsors, Puma -- though probably no more than $20,000 for each
jump.
Edwards, however, will be able almost to name his own price when the
contract is renegotiated. His appearance fee at forthcoming meetings
will be around $20,000, with performance-related bonuses from the
promoter.
When attempts were made to renegotiate his terms with British
officials last month, they refused.
Edwards, a born-again Christian, and son of an Anglican minister,
adopts a practical view.
''I don't have a problem with making money -- it's just my attitude
towards it. Paul was writing a letter to Timothy in the Bible, charging
those that are rich not to become hard-minded, or to trust in uncertain
riches, but to trust in the living God who gives all things to be
enjoyed.
''I will enjoy this success, and what I have, but I won't trust in it.
I'll aim to be a good steward with what I have been given.''
That will mean a new home for his parents. His father is shortly due
to retire. ''It will be tremendous to be in a position to help them to
help them buy somewhere to live.''
And when this physics graduate and former genetics researcher goes to
study theology at a seminary in the USA for four years, as he plans to,
he says he may help financially to endow buildings on the campus.
''It won't specifically lead to anything. I want to really know what
the Bible teaches, and to study it, so that I understand, primarily to
apply it to my life, and live it out.''
It all sounds too good to be true, like a latter-day Eric Liddell. But
this Chariots of Fire figure's Biblical asides are spontaneous, not
calculated or worked for.
The most disconcerting, but most welcome, feature of Jon Edwards is
his physical ordinariness: a cherubic choir-boy face beneath prematurely
greying pepper-and-salt hair.
''Some people are so big in their event, that the exude an aura, like
Linford Christie,'' he says. ''It almost makes the opposition back away
from them. The kind of person I am, people look and say: if he can do
it, I can do it too. I don't think I have any aura. I am just
ordinary.''
The revelation of Jon, the devine jumper, is that his records are a
mystery even to him. ''I can see why I have improved,'' he says. ''I
have maintained my speed. But the extent of what has happened is a
revelation even to me.
''When I went to university, I was very young, and naive -- not very
capable of independent thought, a bit of a sheep.
''I've not sat down and said: 'I'm going to be world champion one
day.' You hear about Seb Coe having planned his career from day one, but
it's not been like that with me.
''I can't believe I left home with no job to go to in Newcastle, to
try and be an athlete, only triple jumping 15-16 metres. I was an
idiot.''
He never had any ambition to be an athlete, having attended a
rugby-playing school in North Devon.
And though world record holder and world champion, he is not even West
Buckland school triple jump record holder. That title is held by England
back-row forward Steve Ojomoh.
In 1985, when still a junior, and a student at Durham University,
Edwards won the Scottish title with 15.09 metres. ''I didn't even know,
in 1985, what the AAA champs were,'' he says.
''I had no thoughts on being an athlete, let alone a triple jumper
until I left university. And if you wanted to be an athlete, you
wouldn't have chosen the triple jump.
''I don't know what the future holds, but I am not worried. I have
tremendous faith in God, that he's in charge of what's happening with
me. Injury permitting, and God willing, I'll carry on until the Olympics
again (ie 2000). I started late, and the way I jump is not particularly
stressful.''
''If I never come within half a meter of what I have done, I have got
no complaints. My life has been fantastic. I can only be thankful. I've
had more in this life than I could have ever asked for, ever hoped for,
or ever deserved.''
Edwards's event goes right back to the roots of athletics. It was
first known of in Irish and Scottish games of the 14th century, when it
was two hops and a jump, and may have been one of the events tackled at
the first Ceres games, in Fife, by victorious soldiers returning from
Bannockburn.
The triple jump was the very first event at the inaugural Athens
Olympics, won by a Harvard University teacher, James Brendon Connolly,
who gave up his job to go. There is a statue of Connolly overlooking
Boston harbour, but no inscription to say what he achieved.
The winning margin here this week was the biggest since Connolly won
in 1896. A statue of Edwards at Gateshead, his home stadium, would not
be out of place. Nor would a visit from the Scottish selectors to his
home. His wife, Alison, is Scottish, which means his two children are
eligible to compete for Scotland!

GRAEME Hick sought out Ray Illingworth for clear-the-air talks in
Nottingham yesterday -- with the subject of discussion his whole future
as a Test cricketer.
Hick was distraught to be left out of England's fourth Test team and
one witness claimed he was close to tears as he drove away from Old
Trafford, having been told he was surplus to requirements on the morning
of the match.
Now, with Robin Smith's shattered cheekbone offering him the chance of
a fifth Test place, Hick is demanding to be told where he stands with
the England hierarchy.
''What I say to Illy is between me and him. But I have asked to see
him because he always says he wants people to give it to him straight.''
Illingworth said: ''Everyone wants to do well, but only Graeme knows
whether he wants to do better for himself or for the team.
''I want people who are prepared to die for England. That's what we
must get over to the players -- and I think that this summer we've made
great strides in that direction. I think people know now what's required
of them.''

CONGLOMERATE Lonrho yesterday said that John Hewlett, 48, head of its
Mozambican operations and staunch supporter of ousted founder Tiny
Rowland, had resigned as a director by mutual agreement.
A Lonrho spokesman said the parting was amicable and the London-based
group denied any link with Rowland's sacking in a board coup led by
German chief executive Dieter Bock in March.
Other sources, however, said Mr Hewlett had seen the push coming and
decided to jump -- to another major job, to be revealed when he quits
Lonrho on August 31 after 16 years service with the group, the last
three on the main board.

of those in the first half of last year.
''This crystallises what everybody already knew about the housing

SCOTTISH business failures in the second quarter of this year were at
their lowest level since accountancy firm KPMG began keeping detailed
records in the late Eighties.
The number of receiverships fell from 32 in the previous quarter to
14, the lowest figure for any part of the UK.

BIG-HITTING Aberdonian David Thomson lost his chance to lead the SPGA
Masters at Downfield yesterday when, ironically, he came to grief at the
shortest hole on the 6822-yard course.
Standing 11 under par for the tournament, he misjudged the swirling
wind at the 151-yard seventeenth hole and proceeded to launch a
No.7-iron shot through the green, from where he took a double-bogey 5.
He had to settle for 71 and a share of third place on 137, nine under
par, with David Scott, the pair respectively one stroke behind leaders
Raymond Russell and Andy Crerar.
Scott's 67 was the best round of the day and put him within touching
distance of the leaders. Leading aggregates:
136 -- R Russell (Longniddry) 68, 68; A Crerar (Downfield) 65, 71.
137 -- D Scott (Letham Grange) 70, 67; D Thomson (Kings Links) 66, 71.
139 -- H Kemp (Bishopbriggs GR) 66, 73.
141 -- B Kelly (Callander) 69, 72.
142 -- F Coutts (Deeside) 69, 73; C Brooks (Glencorse) 70, 72; A Tait
(Cawder) 71, 71; S Henderson (Kings Links) 71, 71.
143 -- G Redford (Turnberry Hotel) 73, 70; D Robinson (Fereneze) 70,
73; S  Thompson (Gleddoch) 73, 70; R Weir (Cowal) 71, 72; P Lawrie
(unattached) 69, 74.

NEW LABOUR appears unduly thin-skinned, particularly on the subject of
links with the trade unions. Unfortunately this has led to a mishandling
of necessary change. For years the Labour Party has endured taunts from
the Tories suggesting that the party is in the pocket of the unions. The
real problems came when union unpopularity reached alarming heights in
years past, leading young thinkers like Mr Blair to conclude, with
eminent sense, that strong unions would always be needed but never,
either explicitly or implicitly, as a part of government. In a sense the
dilemma which the traditional links between the unions and the Labour
Party presented came as the easiest gift to the Tories. It was hardly
taxing for Tory propagandists to seize on the issue and to construct
simplistic and condemnatory slogans which damned both parties and fed
effectively the fears of the electorate. Union unpopularity also made
the task of passing reactionary employment legislation that much easier.
Targets have not been so easy to find in recent years, and certainly
not since the departure of Mr Kinnock. Old campaigns have therefore been
dusted down and pressed into service once more. Thus we have the union
links campaign running concurrently with Dr Mawhinney's resurrection of
the Loony Left tag in relation to Labour-run councils. Labour is perhaps
unwise to register such undue sensitivity, though given the history of
the issue this is understandable. Nevertheless, the inevitable
impression is of an almost desperate desire to remove the more obvious
links which, historical or not, bound the Labour Party to a problematic
partner. The proposals to change the relationship of unions to members
of Parliament, particularly in the area of union sponsorship, have been
around for some time. It is Labour's fault that they appear to have
suddenly leapt from the ground as a hurried response to Tory criticism.
There has been a justifiably angry reaction by Labour to the
implication in the Nolan report that union sponsorship somehow equates
with private consultancy fees paid to Tory MPs. Union sponsorship has
always been used for political ends and does not go into the pockets of
the individual MPs. The confusion over this enhances the need for
change, and the new suggestion that union money should sponsor
constituencies, and particularly marginal ones, is an acceptable way of
dealing with the problem. The proportion of block votes between unions
and constituencies will also change at the party conference, but this
will also be seen as piecemeal change. New Labour needs to redefine its
relationship with the unions and to present the resulting policy as a
coherent whole. This will be seen as initiating change honourably,
rather than reacting to the easy propaganda shots of the Tories.

STATELESS Wilson Kipketer, born in Kenya's Rift Valley but resident in
Denmark, snatched the world 800 metres title last night in the Ullevi
stadium, but only courtesy of the rulers of his sport.
He won wearing the colours of Denmark, but if the government of his
adopted country had had its way, he would not have been here. The
International Amateur Athletic Federation issued a special dispensation
when the Danish parliament denied him citizenship.
They insist immigrants must serve seven years' residence, which means
the newly-crowned world champion is ineligible for next year's Olympics.
The IOC recognises only national citizenship.
''Don't you think a gold medal will have a positive effect on
parliament?'' he mused. ''I won the race for me, my coach, and for
Denmark.'' He was content to remain at the back, last at the break and
sometimes running out in lane three. Only fifth at the bell (52.53), and
though still four metres off the pace at 600m (79.56), he stormed home
in 1min 45.08secs.
This was by no means a vintage two-lap final, but Kipketer, ranked
fifth on the world all-time list with 1-42.87 earlier this year, is the
first man in a decade to approach Seb Coe's world mark (1-41.73).
An assault on Coe's time will come in Zurich a week tonight. But here
he was content with a cautious win, and making a political point. He
grabbed his adopted country's flag, and donned a cap bearing the logo of
a Copenhagen brewery. No probably -- he is the best 800m runner in the
world.
The Kenyans have won the last three world 800m titles -- Tom McKean's
nemesis Billy Konchellah (twice), and Paul Ruto -- but yesterday they
had no-one in the final.
Their No.1, Joseph Tengelei, eliminated in the semis, was Kipketer's
best friend at school. But, though now resident in Texas, he came home
for the Kenyan trials. ''I am proud of my country,'' he said.
Kipketer is a disturbing phenomenon to the Kenyan track authorities,
many of whose leading runners now find life abroad more attractive than
the altitude villages which have spawned some of the world's greatest
runners of recent years.
They also failed in the 10,000m, at which distance they have won five
out of nine possible medals in the last three championships. Haile
Gebreselassie won by producing a 25.00 second final 200m -- faster than
Kipketer's last furlong in the 800 metres (25.52).
The Ethiopian won in 27-12.95, a championship record and surprisingly
fast considering it was 13-46.20 at halfway. Khalid Skah, who carried
his son on a lap of honour, was second in a Moroccan record. Kenya's
Paul Tergat, the reigning world cross-country champion was third as
Africans filled the first six places.
Gebreselassie, who does not drive, collected a second Mercedes. The
first, for winning this title two years ago, is in has garage in Addis
Ababa. He will not use it, because he believes it will make him soft
''like Westerners.'' So he just sits in it, switches on the radio, and
pretends to drive.
He could be into a third Merc, for he intends to run the 5000m, and
his finishing speed is reminiscent of Miruts Yifter ''The Shifter'', the
last man to do the same double at the Olympics, in 1980. He, too, was
Ethiopian.
Marie-Jose Perec shrugged off a leg injury to win the women's 400m in
49.28, but her reception was muted -- possibly a protest against French
nuclear testing in the Pacific.
Commonwealth champion Cathy Freeman blasted out too fast and, though
second with 70m left, was cut down by Pauline Davis (49.96) and Jearl
Miles (50.00).
''When I warmed up I thought I could not run,'' said the statuesque
Perec. ''But I knew I had won after 250 metres.''
Steve Smith made a gallant attempt to win the high jump, but was
disappointed with fourth in a contest memorable for the demise of world
record holder and defending champion Javier Sotomayor.
The Cuban cleared 2.37, the same as Bahamian Troy Kemp, but lost on a
countback. Artur Partyka was third on 2.35, the same as Smith and
fifth-placed Steinar Hoen, the European champion.
It was the first championship since the Olympics that Smith had failed
to medal. He took bronze in the last world championships, and was
runner-up in last year's European and Commonwealth Games. He failed
twice at 2.37, but, scorning the chance of bronze, saved his final, vain
attempt, for 2.39.
''I had two injections in a foot injury, and kept missing heights to
give the anaesthetic as long as possible to take effect,'' he said.
''I tried to get the crowd to clap me along, but the Scandinavians
weren't interested -- I think they were a bit biased.''
Sweden's former world record holder, Patrick Sjoberg -- pronounced
''whoaberry'' as we were constantly reminded -- took the lead to
thunderous partisan acclaim at 2.32m. He went no higher, finishing
sixth.
Michelle Griffith qualified for tomorrow's triple jump final with
14.03m, but Ashia Hansen, allowed to jump without confirming her
fitness, reached only 13.61m against her best of 14.37. Louise Fraser
was eliminated in the one-lap hurdles heats with 57.99, more than a
second and a half slower than her best, and Mark Proctor, with 18.08m in
the shot, also failed to reach the final. His longest putt, 19.37m,
achieved just three weeks ago, would have seen him through.

THE number of mortgage holders in serious arrears to the Woolwich
Building Society is down by more than 25% on last year, the group
reported yesterday.
The news accompanied results for the six months to the end of June
which showed pre-tax profits marginally up at #142m from #136m in the
first six months of last year.
Provisions for bad debts fell by #8m to #22m.
Chief executive David Kirkham said: ''The result is a continued
demonstration of the success of the society's arrears management policy;
and it is gratifying to report that the number of families in serious
arrears (12 months plus) is down by more than 25% compared to this time
last year.''
On prospects for the housing market, he added: ''The disappointingly
sluggish conditions which we have seen in the first half of 1995 show no
signs of improving in the second half.
''Nevertheless, I would hope that the more favourable relationship
which is emerging between house prices and incomes will trigger some
recovery in transactions and prices early in 1996.''
Gross lending during the six months fell to #1272m from #1322m,
reflecting fewer people moving home. The net amount of money deposited
by savers rose from a restated #22m to #89m.

THE restoration of morale and purpose in Barclays senior management
after recession-induced traumas was almost tangible yesterday as it
delivered half-time results which showed stable operating profits and an
8.7% rise in pre-tax profits to #1125m.
Chief executive, Martin Taylor said the results were complex, which
they certainly are, if one looks behind the raw figures. What they show
is that the bank has taken a highly prudent approach to its
unsatisfactory assets, chiefly in France, and also a rise of #400m in
general provisioning.
The market reacted by knocking 21p off the shares which have had a
good run recently and also because there was not a special dividend.
Instead chairman Andrew Buxton said there would be a modest re-purchase
of share capital because the bank is over-capitalised. Later it was
indicated the amount involved would be small.
In an aside, he said the interest rate question was finely balanced as
consumer confidence remains low and a rise would not improve that
situation. Large tax cuts, he added, would put up rates.
The interim dividend has been raised 19% to 9.5p.
Mr Buxton poured scorn on the row raised over school children in the
Reading and Slough areas receiving work experience in the bank --
something which has been happening for several years. He also criticised
Labour Party claims that Barclays was sacking 3000 people this year
whereas it has recruited 700 in customer services.
Activities in France are currently the most pressing problem, having
lost #203m in the half year including a further write-down of the Paris
headquarters. But there is a desire to keep soldiering on in a reduced
and more efficient operation.
The losses incurred in France were outweighed by #241m of exceptional
gains arising from the disposal of two US businesses and part of the 3i
holding which itself was worth #33m.
The Taylor doctrine is to reduce the amount of surplus capital in the
bank to help individual lending decisions and so the balance sheet is
being shrunk by spurning low yielding, high risk business.
His estimate is that the bank needs to make a provision of 0.7% on its
loans over an economic cycle which would amount to about #750m annually
at present, thus pointing to a more scientific approach than has been
the case among the banks when dealing with corporate loans.
Overall profitability was helped by a better interest spread thanks to
more active management of the deposit books, better returns from the
personal customer and from Barclaycard. Overall UK lending was down
except for a slight growth in the mortgage book.
The BZW securities and treasury business saw its year-on-year
contribution drop #50m to #130m but that is double the return for the
December half year.
One critical factor is whether the #275m acquisition of Wells Fargo
Nikko Investment Advisers, which brings in about #110m of funds under
management or twice that of BZW itself, will lead to complications in
grafting the two investment philosophies together.
Barclays has lost about #1.5m on Barings Perpetual Notes issued last
year and where BZW was one of the underwriters. These are now valueless.
Full-year profits look like rising from #1859m to about #2150m with
the second half probably bearing more general bad debt provisioning.
Attention to shareholders capital is the dominant strategy rather than
expansion and the stock does seem to be the pick of the banks at present
with a 26p dividend total possible for a 4.5% yield.

THE Scottish Rugby Union has been the victim of too many high tackles.
Yesterday, after a commendably brief period of thought, the SRU laid out
its proposals to end the ridiculous hypocrisy over the issue of
professionalism which has threatened to diminish the reputation of the
game. It should be congratulated for being the first home board to take
the issue seriously and to bring forward proper solutions. All of the
international boards face the same dilemma as the SRU. For a number of
years they have watched illegal payments creep into the game while
having to acknowledge privately that the demands made of the top players
made the question of full-time play and pay inevitable. The disruption
caused by the issue was growing and the boards in the southern
hemisphere had made clear already their desire to pay their players, if
only to keep them from Rugby League.
The real watershed came when Rupert Murdoch settled a #350m deal with
the southern hemisphere boards for the televising of games. Ironically
this is a rare example of the multi-millionaire meddler actually doing
something to benefit the long-term future of a game. His intervention
galvanised the boards into action. The full meeting of the International
Rugby Football Union in Paris at the end of the month will consider the
issue and it will have before it the details of the situation in the
southern hemisphere and the proposals of the SRU. Although some former
worthies will be birling in their graves there is little doubt that the
SRU's proposals will be accepted. The top players will benefit
handsomely, the game will be invigorated, and in Scotland the situation
will be controlled properly by the SRU.
This is an effective answer (as if the building of the new Murrayfield
was not enough) to those who have said that the SRU was losing control
of the game in its own country. More importantly, the game
internationally can now survive as a coherent entity, with similar rules
in all countries and the risk of a north-south divide removed,
hopefully, for ever.

THE regulatory uncertainty overhanging the electricity sector looks
set to continue following the Office of Fair Trading's (OFT)
announcement yesterday that it needed more time to consider Southern
Electric International's #1000m hostile bid for South Western
Electricity (Sweb).
The OFT said it was extending the period for consideration until
September 1 to make a decision on whether the bid warrants a referral to
the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. It was originally due to make
recommendations to the Department of Trade and Industry by August 10.
The electricity regulator, Offer, is known to be concerned that
additional measures may be necessary to protect customers and maintain
regulatory effectiveness. This is because if the takeover goes ahead a
public electricity supply licence would, for the first time, be held by
a subsidiary rather than a parent company.
Yesterday, City analysts were busy trying to assess the implications
of the OFT's announcement on ScottishPower's hostile bid for Manweb and
Hanson's agreed offer for the Eastern group. Ian Lang, President of the
Board of Trade, is under pressure to begin an inquiry into all the
current power bids.
The Southern Company, which is bidding for Sweb through its wholly
owned subsidiary Southern Electric International, has extended its offer
to 3pm on August 21. It currently has acceptances worth just 1.1% of
Sweb's share capital, a figure not unusual at this stage in the bid
process, especially given the uncertainty about the actions of the
regulator.
The lack of a white knight for Sweb has prompted the shares to slip
back. Yesterday they were down 28p at 916p. Speculation continues that a
number of Continental European and American companies, and possibly
other UK regional electricity companies (Recs), are poised to enter the
contest for Bristol-based Sweb.
* LONDON Electricity, mooted as the next bid target, has appointed
Michael Kersey as group chief executive to replace Roger Urwin who will
resign in late September. Mr Urwin is to become managing director,
transmission, for National Grid, which is due to be floated later this
year.

ROYAL Bank of Scotland yesterday named the banks which have joined it
as additional underwriters of an #800m syndicated loan to ScottishPower,
which will part-fund the Glasgow-based utility's #1000m bid for Manweb.
The Herald exclusively revealed two weeks ago that ScottishPower had
appointed Royal Bank as sole arranger of the loan.
Chemical Bank of the US, Denmark's Den Danske, Holland's Rabobank,
Japan's Sanwa and Union Bank of Switzerland all accepted Royal Bank's
invitation to guarantee the availability of the five-year revolving
credit facility.
Royal Bank sought the support of these banks immediately after
ScottishPower announced its hostile bid for the Chester-based
electricity distributor on July 24.
The #800m loan is the biggest corporate financing package it has ever
put together as sole arranger.
The group of international banks will be watching the progress of the
bid, which may face regulatory or monopoly hurdles, with interest.
If it is successful, Royal Bank will go out to the syndicated loan
market to raise the funds.
Documentation for the facility was completed at the end of last week.
ScottishPower issued its formal offer to Manweb shareholders on Monday.

America's computer giant launches its most advanced software package
this month. Joe Donnelly previews Windows 95 and finds its added speed
and processing power ideal for businesses, beginners, and disabled
users.
IT IS the biggest fenestration since the invention of glass itself. It
is the launch of Microsoft Windows 95, yet another giant step forward in
the implacable march of information technology. If you do not own a
desktop computer at the moment, this might not interest you, but it
should. Eventually it will.
According to forecasts, by the end of the century, 50% of all homes
will have a personal computer. Most of them will probably run a
Microsoft program and it is likely to be Windows 95, set to be launched
on a suspecting world on August 24.
On the technology grapevine, Windows 95 has been the talk of the
steamie, to use a cliche, for the past couple of years. It should have
been shipped in 1993, but deadlines expanded on what was code-named
''Chicago'' designed by the world's biggest, richest, and most powerful
software company.
To give an idea of how big the Windows operation is, the program's
various updated versions have sold more copies than the biggest selling
album of all time, Michael Jackson's Thriller. To date, 70 million
copies have hit the market. Microsoft boasts that one copy of Windows is
sold every second somewhere in the world, totalling 2.2 million a month.
Now Windows 95 is on the brink. It is the newest, allegedly most
advanced system, an updated, improved version of previous Windows
generations with added speed and processing power. By this time next
year, some 20 million plus copies of the program will probably have been
sold. At an approximate price of #70, it is huge business.
For those who don't hang around John Menzies' magazine section leafing
through the computer glossies, a brief explanation. Later an expanded
one.
Windows 95 is the upgrade of the Microsoft Windows program which
basically enables users to use their machines without having to program
the computer. Using a mouse to move the cursor on screen, the operating
system allows the user to point and click to open and close files,
print, fax, store and save information. On a world base of more than 200
million PCs, roughly 80% are running a Microsoft program. Windows 95
also updates the MS DOS, disk-operating system which is the computer's
operational program.
Windows 95 offers a graphical interface which should make PC use
simpler, but the program also comes with Plug and Play technology which
means that CD-Roms, modems, and other peripherals will automatically
configure to the system without complex command instructions.
So far thousands of beta-testers around the world have put the final
prototype versions through its paces to eliminate any bugs, so the new
Microsoft baby will arrive fully fledged onto an expectant market.
In a world of fast change the only certainty is that the computer you
buy today will be obsolete in a few years. In a world of ever more
economical technology, that might not matter in the long run. Business
generates business and obsolescence ensures turnover.
Windows 95 is coming out just at the right time, even if it is a year
or so late, because of the depressed prices of much more powerful
processors.
The developers themselves say that when a user moves up to Windows 95,
performance will meet or exceed performance of the previous generation
Windows 3.1, on the 386DX or higher system with at least 4 MB of RAM for
the same set of tasks.
For systems with more than 4MB of memory, performance will be improved
over Windows 3.1.
A more realistic power level is the next generation 486 chip with an
8MB random access memory, and even better a 16-meg cruncher which means
that many potential users will have to upgrade the hardware to run the
software, even if it means only extending the RAM memory. The choice
will be to upgrade or just buy a new system. The push is on to persuade
people to buy new because, in general, customers who get a new machine
will get the program already loaded on their system.
The leapfrog evolution will then spark off the next upgrade in
programing power to meet the demands of the next generation of chips. As
programs become larger and vastly more complex to make usage simpler,
computers themselves must become more powerful and have faster
brainpower to cope.
The business is even bigger than that, however, because Windows 95 is
Microsoft's entree to the World Wide Web and that is a hugely expanding
and vastly lucrative global business. The new system will come complete
with software to access the new Microsoft network which will offer a
wide internet service including E-Mail, shopping, entertainment, and
sports news access.
This move could allow Microsoft to join the biggest of the big
on-liners which includes CompuServe with more than 3,000,000 members,
America On-line and IBM's Prodigy.
The very fact that the ''95 software comes with a net access to the
distributor's own service has led to a massive investigation by US
anti-trust (monopoly) investigators. The company's rivals have
complained that Microsoft's dominance of computer systems -- Windows
varieties are now the accepted industry standard and apply to 80% of all
machines -- will give it an unfair advantage.
The US Justice Department has been asked to force the company to strip
out the access server. If in fact Windows 95 does sell as many copies as
some predict, its network users could easily outnumber the big three
networkers altogether, with the further advantage of having on-line
shopping and marketing to help further boost Microsoft Sales, giving it
a potential razor edge on the market.
Already Microsoft's share price has soared by 95% in anticipation of
huge profits from the drive to sell this new product. For the past
couple of weeks, everybody who is anybody at all in the substantial
line-up of public relations firms hired by Microsoft have been taken
across to the other side of the Atlantic for briefings.
For the company, it is the event of the year, if not the decade, and
for many suppliers, advisers, trainers and servicers, business is
expected to be brisk. Microsoft is hoping for a big response from
corporate system users, who already account for more than two thirds of
PCs.
Abtex Computer Systems, operating in Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen,
the second-fastest growing Scottish company, has been chosen as launch
supplier of Windows 95 and its sister program, Office for Windows 95,
for the business sector.
Liz Paddon, marketing manager said: ''The long-term implications are
far-reaching. Microsoft currently holds 80% of the applications market
and there is little doubt that Windows 95 will become the leading
operating system.
''By forging this partnership, we can provide a value-added service by
accessing the additional consultancy and support of the world's leading
software manufacturer. The system is set to move computing into a new
era, giving users the chance to achieve more than ever before. It will
enhance business efficiency, speeding up decision-making through
improved networking and systems management tools.''
Whether or not the business community responds with enthusiasm remains
to be seen. Many of them may want to keep the old, tried and trusted
version of Windows on their systems and see how things develop.
Microsoft seems to expect some delay in business enthusiasm, because its
promotion material says that companies wanting to make the transition at
their own pace will still be able to run Program Manager and File
Manager during the transition period.
Despite what will be a huge and hard sell, the market will likely be
driven by home users, because they are already interested in systems for
their own sake and are always keen to try out the new. Added to that is
the fact that new machines will have Windows 95 preloaded.
It may be that at the end of the day, the Scottish business sector
will be edged into the new system just because so many home-users
already know how to use the darned thing.

ROBBIE Williams, the former Take That star, said last night that he
was sacked by the band and its manager.
In a statement released through his solicitor, he said he was asked
halfway through rehearsals for the 1995 UK tour not to participate
further.
Until now, the official line was that Williams had been happy to leave
before the end of his contract.
''For some time Robbie Williams has become concerned with the way the
band has been developing and the way the management was allowing the
band, and in particular, Robbie Williams, to grow,'' the statement from
solicitor Jack Rabinowicz said.
''He had discussed his concerns with other members of the band and the
management. However, he has received no positive feedback from either
the management or from most of the band members,'' it said.
He had been prepared to continue with the band during this year.
''Much to his surprise, halfway through rehearsals for the UK tour he
was asked by the band and the management not to participate further in
the tour at all.''
Take That responded by expressing sadness over their ex-partner's
comments.
''It was agreed by all five of us that the best thing to do was for
him to leave the band to pursue a solo career. It is a great shame that,
after all the love and good times we shared together, this has now
become a media issue,'' the band's statement said.

Tokyo, Tuesday
JAPANESE Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama sacked 16 of his 20 cabinet
ministers today in the first reshuffle of his coalition government.
However, the impact of the shake-up in the 14-month-old government
after an electoral setback was blunted by Murayama retaining his key
finance, trade and foreign ministers.
Murayama told a news conference: ''We will strive hard to prop up the
economy and stabilise employment by carrying out seamless economic
measures, including a second supplementary budget.''
Murayama's only surprise appointment was Economic Planning Agency
Minister Isamu Miyazaki, a researcher at the Daiwa Institute, the only
non-politician in the new line-up.
The reshuffle ended five days of haggling over whether Murayama's key
allies -- Yohei Kono, leader of the Liberal Democratic Party and
Sakigake head Masayoshi Takemura -- would stay on as foreign and finance
ministers respectively.--Reuter.

Douglas Thompson talks to the naughty but nice Sandra Bullock, who is
determined to keep her head, and her cool, despite being hailed as one
of Hollywood's hottest leading ladies
THE grin is wicked. It's naughty, like everything else about Sandra
Bullock. She's the sort who'll stand on Hollywood Boulevard's Walk of
Fame with Joan Collins's ''star'' stuck to her foot like a piece of
chewing gum and announce to the gawping tourists: ''Hi, I'm Sandy --
welcome to Hollywood.''
She has already received that enthusiastic welcome. As one of the
major Hollywood ladies for the rest of the century -- and on to wherever
super-hot rockets go -- the red carpet runs all the way to the front
door of her Hollywood Hills home.
Welcome? You can hardly say hello for the crush.
Multi-million dollar deals; half a dozen films either in production or
about to be made. She's so busy she had to forfeit Batman Forever and
allow Nicole Kidman to play the Caped Crusader's Wonderbra fancy. She
also had to turn down the remake of Sabrina (Britain's Julia Ormond
happily stepped in) in which she would have taken the Audrey Hepburn
role opposite Harrison Ford.
With her latest film While You Were Sleeping, a huge-hit romantic
comedy, due to open in Britain on August 25, she is forthright about her
status as lady of the moment.
Not serious. Forthright.
''When it gets right down to it, I'm as shallow as anybody else,'' she
says with her long, slender face parted like a hairline by that perky,
pesky smile. ''My day depends on how my hair is working out.''
Everyone, except her, is taking Bullock -- she's 28, daffy and sexy
and supercool -- very seriously. She'll talk about her lost dogs or her
German opera-singing mum Helga or Alabama dad John (''I have a great
taste in furniture and can drink beer with the best of them'') or her
law-student sister Gesine, 24, but try to keep her on the track of the
fame fast lanes and she'll do her best to derail you. It's as though
accepting it all might be a jinx.
But when she gets excited she talks as though she was still in Speed
rather than the star of last year's major action-adventure box office
success. Then she'll apply the brake and you get: ''I get bored watching
some actors. People will get bored with me. I can't think I'm
invincible.''
But it does look that way at present. Even Larry Park's Diner --
Hollywood's celebrity deli -- wants to name a sandwich after her.
Bullock (''I'm a sloppy eater'') rather likes the idea (as long as
peanut butter and marshmallow fluff are involved).
For a time she was the ''other girl'' in films -- the character you
noticed and forgot as the action moved on. Like The Vanishing with
Kiefer Sutherland. She was the one who vanished. ''The greatest job
ever. You come in for two weeks' work and they talk about you for the
entire film.''
There was more screen time in Wrestling with Ernest Hemingway in which
she co-starred with veterans Richard Harris and Robert Duvall.
Oscar-winner Duvall helped her with what is now her passion -- salsa
dancing. No matter what city she is in she will find a Latin club to
kick her heels up.
Randi ''Children of a Lesser God'' Haines, who directed Wrestling with
Ernest Hemingway, and her boyfriend Darryl Matthews are also salsa
freaks. Every lunchtime during filming they would all go dancing.
''I love to go into clubs and dance. That's when I feel sexy -- I know
I'm sexy.'' She laughs: ''I might be living in my own little world here,
you know?
''When I go to salsa and Latin clubs, when my partner and I are
dancing to great music a different side of me comes out. I dress
differently. The skirts are short, you wear the higher heel, the tighter
top. Your hair is everywhere. So don't speak to me! I'm s-s-smokin!'
''I started with salsa and then I went on to flamenco and the tango.
These are dances where you have to trust your partner. You have to be
comfortable because it's almost like making love on the dance floor.
Nothing makes me happier than dancing. Nothing. It transforms me.
''Eating and salsa are kind of like sex. They just make you feel
all-around good. And I am obsessed with it.''
Salsa or sex?
The cat smile.
''Well I'm interested in both. My parents had The Joy of Sex
downstairs and a girlfriend and I in elementary school would go through
and pick out who we were going to do what with. But I was a virgin until
I was 19.''
She was hitting the audition circuit as much as the dance floor and
the producers of Sylvester Stallone's cult sci-fi Demolition Man were
looking for a wisecracking futuristic policewoman to help him track down
villain Wesley Snipes -- and also get the rather humour-heavy superstar
some laughs.
Stallone has never been more effective as a comic turn than with
Bullock setting up his sequences. She had Demolition Man doing screwball
comedy -- and engaging in virtual reality sex with her. ''It was
wonderful for him.'' What about her? ''It's too far in the future to
predict.''
She was not intimidated by the Stallone stature: ''Everything that
drives him nuts about a person I possess. We were like dog and cat. I
refuse to let anybody show me up, especially a man. And here I was with
Rocky/Rambo and thinking I could outbox them.''
She did. And they remain great friends.
As she does with Keanu Reeve, her ''rescuer'' in last year's
blockbuster movie Speed. She had to fight for her role: ''I had to read
for it just to make sure the chemistry was okay between me and Keanu. We
had to do all these really physical scenes together, rolling on the
floor and stuff. At one point Keanu stumbled into me and sort of grabbed
my butt. I asked him: 'Are you copping a feel?' He got all panicky and
was like 'Noooo! I was'nt!'' I was, like, 'Relax Keanu. Just kidding'.''
Reeve was the superman who had to stop explosive expert Dennis Hopper
and a bomb-rigged bus from going under 50mph. Bullock was sad Annie, the
passenger who never went anywhere and suddenly had to drive the bus all
over the Los Angeles freeway system with her eyes on the speedometer.
Everyone loved Annie and Sandra Bullock. She was in Tinseltown
overdrive.
Now, the world is falling over her again for While You Were Sleeping,
the fairytale romance which broke records in America and has Bullock as
a lonely Lucy who hands out subway tokens, looks out the window but has
never opened the door. Then, drama. She rescues a man who falls on to
the railway tracks. He falls into a coma. She falls for his brother,
played by the increasingly watchable and talented Bill Pullman.
The complication is the coma guy's family. They think he and Lucy are
engaged. And everyone then loves Lucy. Bullock holds the total
implausible mix together and won critical plaudits and lots and lots of
box-office dollars.
She has completed the techno-thriller The Net in which she's a
computer whiz terrorised by cyber-hoodlums. Also finished is Two If By
Sea in which she co-stars in a ''Lovejoy'' style comedy-thriller about
art thieves. Then she's starring in and producing Kate and Leopold about
a time-travelling British nobleman.
Did we say overdrive?
After that there is A Time To Kill, the film adaptation of John
Grisham's first novel.
What does Bullock think of all this?
''I want to go and see Tom Jones in Las Vegas. His latest album is
phenomenal. I wanted to meet that guy, spandex and all. I must get that
man's autograph. He's my idol.''
A groupie then? Well, not exactly. She recently ended a four-year
relationship with actor Tate Donovan -- they met on Love Potion No.9 --
and is now, as she happily puts, it ''resting''.
Tempted by her leading men, like Stallone and Reeve and Pullman? ''I'm
really good at keeping things separate. Acknowledge that, sure, he's
cute and you have chemistry with him, but go home in separate cars.''
0    She enjoyed working with Dennis Hopper in Speed. He is, of
course, the movies' prince of darkness. ''I want to be like Dennis. But
I can't, so I hang around people like that and kind of stick my toe in
the water occasionally. This is the only profession that commends you
for being a dark, wild person.
''People kept telling my mother that I was the devil's child because I
would never listen.''

WILLIAM RUSSELL sees Michael Caine and Richard Harris's fall-out as
great entertainment
WHEN actors fall out, as Richard Harris has done with Michael Caine,
the rest of the world can only sit back and admire the fireworks. There
is inevitably something larger than life, titanic almost, about the
display. Actors come in many shapes, but foolish or wise, they all know
about words because their art depends on it.
It is when actors get bitchy, however, that they are at their best as
the current glorious spat between Caine, ne Maurice Micklewhite, and
Harris, a case of Alfie meets Horse, demonstrates. When they are good
with words, like the highly-literate Harris, so much the better. He
belongs to the ranks of those legendary hellraisers of the British
cinema of the sixties -- Richard Burton, Peter O'Toole, Oliver Reed,
Laurence Harvey and Terence Stamp, Maurice's old flatmate in their salad
days as aspiring actors from the East End. Harris, Burton and O'Toole
were legendary drunks in their time. Burton, who never gave up, and
Harvey are both long dead, O'Toole and Harris have been on the wagon for
years. Reed, possibly the most outrageous of the lot, is not involved in
the brouhaha, and Stamp, into health foods and mysticism, for years
pursued the life of a gentleman with a flat in Albany, although he now
lives in the United States.
The row started when Caine -- who has made almost 80 films in a career
which began in 1956 with A Hill in Korea, although it was not until Zulu
in 1965 that he became a star -- gave an interview to publicise his
latest film. In it he once again plays Harry Palmer, the role he first
played in Len Deighton's The Ipcress File in 1966, which confirmed his
star status.
Caine's return to playing Harry Palmer smacks of desperation. In the
course of a long interview in the Sunday Times 10 days ago he relished
his unofficial role of Our Man in Los Angeles, where he lived from 1979
until recently. He came back to Britain in 1987, but only sold his LA
home in February. ''Stamp did drugs, but I never did,'' he opined. ''The
British actors were all drunks -- O'Toole, Harris, Burton -- but at
least it takes 25 years to kill yourself with it.''
Harris's reaction was splenetic. In a letter to the Sunday Times from
his home in the Bahamas he called Caine ''an over-fat, flatulent
62-year-old windbag, a master of inconsequence now masquerading as a
guru, passing of his vast limitations as pious virtues.'' As for the
fact that he and his colleagues drank, he said they had ''dared to cross
the threshold from sophisticated, drawing room, strangulated drollery to
the wilderness where we not only faced the lion's roar but smelled the
breath of their bad habits; a voyage most great actors embarked on where
they might touch the Gods to ignite their craft.''
Harris, who at 65 is three years older, has made fewer films, and has
only two best-actor Oscar nominations -- This Sporting Life and The
Field -- said Caine, had ''succeeded in adding to the population of
vacuous people who inhabit'' LA, and was a man ''continually deluded by
triviality . . . . a professional talker using his words as a quack uses
remedies.'' As for the suggestion by the interviewer that Caine had
eclipsed the names of Finney, O'Toole, Burton, Bates, Courtenay and
Maggie Smith in terms of fame, Harris said that was ''tantamount to
prophesying that Rin-Tin-Tin will be solemnised beyond the memory of
Brando.''
Caine's claim that Stamp now sat in bored silences when they met,
Harris said was no testament to Stamp's intelligence, but ''rather
serves to measure the shallowness of Caine's rather buoyant
superficiality''.
The letter is a classic of the genre. Caine has decided to adopt the
dignified attitude to the assault. ''I have not read the letter, I am
not interested in reading it, and that is my only comment,'' is all he
will say. It is, however, a splendid row although, unless Caine changes
his mind, it has nowhere left to go.
O'Toole, who lives in exotic Cricklewood, has been teetotal since
1975, Harris, almost teetotal, takes the occasional Guinness for
nutritional reasons, while Terence Stamp, who pops up from time to time
as the statutory British villain in Hollywood adventure films, enjoyed
the biggest hit any of them have had in ages last year as a transexual
in Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.
Yesterday's hell raisers have become today's senior citizens, leading
lives of the utmost respectability.

DEMAND for building-related products continues to be adversely
affected by the depressed state of the housing market. The Spring Ram
group, which specialises in building kitchens, bathrooms and doors, saw
a marked drop in demand in late February and sales have yet to recover.
In addition to the weak demand, rising raw material and other costs
hit margins and so the company reported a #17.3m loss in the first six
months of the year. This included exceptionals of #16.7m and compares
with a previous loss of #1.1m.
Some #13.7m of the exceptionals relate to the recent acquisition of
Crosby Sarek from Norcros. The costs stemmed from integrating its doors
and kitchens businesses into existing operations. The group hopes the
takeover will enable its Regency doors business to make a profit.
The Spring Ram business moved from a #2.2m profit into a #3.2m loss
excluding acquisitions. This was in spite of a 7% increase in turnover
to #137m. Acquisitions contributed sales of #6.3m. There is no final
dividend although the board hopes to improve on last year's final
payment of 0.5p.
Following the trading statement City analysts were considering
downgrading their full-year, pre-tax profit forecasts of around #13m.
Spring Ram shares dropped 3p to 37p.

A SUBSIDIARY of the German industrial conglomerate Siemens has been
confirmed, after months of speculation, as the buyer for the National
Engineering Laboratory at East Kilbride.
The Government, which is privatising NEL and two other Department of
Trade and Industry laboratories, announced yesterday that Siemens
subsidiary Assessment Services Ltd (ASL), one of Britain's leading test
and consultancy organisations, has been selected as the preferred
bidder.
The Hampshire-based company beat off opposition from a number of
bidders, including ScottishPower, to buy NEL for an undisclosed sum and
has said it plans to retain all parts of the facility and its 230 jobs.
It has also pledged that existing terms and conditions will be
protected under the Transfer of Undertaking, Protection of Employment
regulations, while it plans to increase the workforce if, as it expects,
NEL's turnover increases by between 10% and 20% in the medium-term.
Staff have, however, greeted the announcement with ''grave suspicion''
and say they fear ASL will not deliver all of its promises.
Workers are concerned that the existing NEL management team is
expected by ASL to remain in charge and say they have no confidence in
management's ability to run the company in the private sector.
Union members voted by 97% against privatisation and a proposed
management buy-out, which later failed, in a ballot in January this
year.
Announcing the selection of ASL, Lord Fraser, the Minister of State at
the DTI, said yesterday that the company was chosen because it would
meet the DTI's needs for flow measurement as part of the National
Measurement System.
It would also provide the opportunity to forge a successful future as
a technology service company in the private sector and providing value
for money for the taxpayer.
The sale and purchase agreement is expected to be completed by the end
of September, with the core business and all related staff transferring
to ASL about a month later.
ASL has said it has no plans to sell off any parts of NEL, which will
continue to trade under that name, and that its location in East
Kilbride is guaranteed.
ASL's director and general manager, Geoff Matthews, who met NEL staff
yesterday, said the company believed NEL's reputation as a centre of
excellence for the mechanical and heavy electrical engineering industry
was ''totally complementary'' with ASL's expertise in industrial,
electrical, and electronic engineering.
He added: ''Assessment services is committed to securing a successful
future for NEL in Scotland, and enhancing its worldwide reputation for
technical excellence and ensuring its profitability.''
A DTI spokesman said the Government was privatising NEL because it
believed the facility would have ''a better, more secure future in the
private sector and a better chance of growth''.
However, the Institution of Professionals, Managers and Specialists,
the union representing all scientists and engineers at NEL, yesterday
accused the DTI of carrying out a ''callous, short-term act'' and said
it feared privatisation and believed the facility was a unique national
asset which should remain in the public sector.
The IPMS said staff face a further period of uncertainty which would
be compounded by the departure of NEL chief executive Bill Edgar, who is
to join the Wood Group offshore services and engineering specialists.
It fears the sell-off will fragment NEL's public work and research
teams; damage its reputation as a centre of scientific excellence and
public service; put private profit ahead of public investment; and deny
wider access to the results of public research and development.
Helen Stevens of IPMS Scotland said: ''We obviously welcome the
assurances ASL are giving but we want a bit more than just words.
''We want written guarantees that they are going to keep their
promises once the sale goes through.
''Staff are demanding a guarantee that jobs, pensions, trade union
recognition, and redundancy entitlements are protected.''
Ms Stevens added that it was incredible that Siemens could see the
importance of NEL while the Government could not.
''Siemens is a commercial business while NEL is an impartial public
body. How can future clients have confidence in its objectivity when
they may be in direct competition?''
The first formal meeting between ASL and unions at NEL is scheduled to
take place today.

POLICE in Glasgow last night began an investigation after the body of
a woman was recovered from the River Clyde near the Jamaica Street
bridge.
The body was spotted by a passer-by, and pulled out by Mr George
Parsonage of the Glasgow Humane Society. A post-mortem examination will
be carried out today. Police refused to comment on whether there were
any suspicious circumstances, and said it was too early to speculate on
the cause of death.

FOR millions of Americans, it was one of the most famous kisses in
history -- and a tantalising mystery.
A Life magazine photograph taken during street celebrations of the
Japanese surrender on August 14, 1945, shows a tall, dark-haired sailor
kissing a nurse in New York City's Times Square.
Expressing the unbounded joy and relief that was felt at the end of
the Second World War, the sailor holds the nurse in an embrace
resembling a dance step from a tango. The nurse, dressed in a white
uniform, has one foot lifted lightly off the ground.
The 27-year-old nurse was identified by Life in August 1980 as Edith
Shain, now 77 and living in Santa Monica, California.
But the sailor's identity was never known. Several men have claimed to
be the famous kisser, but they all were rejected by Life or Mrs Shain.
Now, along comes former New York City detective Carl Muscarello, a
Florida pensioner who says he was the one -- and Mrs Shain agrees.
Muscarello, then 19, worked on a submarine tender during the war. The
4ft 10in Mrs Shain was a civilian nurse who had been selected for the
Army nursing corps and was to leave the following year.
So why did Muscarello wait until now to come forward?
''My mother always knew it was me. My kids know it's me. I just never
made a big deal over it,'' said Muscarello, a 68-year-old widower who is
remarried and lives in Fort Lauderdale.
He said a childhood friend from the New York City borough of Brooklyn,
war veteran Martin Pollio, encouraged him a few months ago to step
forward.
''I'm doing this for my kids and my grandchildren. I don't want any
money out of this,'' Muscarello said in a telephone interview.
Once he made up his mind to become a footnote in American history,
Muscarello called Mrs Shain. She was sceptical. Then he appeared on her
doorstep last week with a bouquet. They talked for hours.
Life has not said whether it believes Muscarello's story. Photographer
Alfred Eisenstaedt, now 96, did not return a message left at his office
in New York.
Mrs Shain says she never got a really good look at the face of the
sailor. She acknowledges she can never be completely sure, but believes
Muscarello really is the one.--AP/Reuter.

Stephen McGinty checks out street style to see if what public
employees wear at work really matters
THE news that taxi drivers at Glasgow Airport will have to follow a
new dress code before they can be cleared for take-off may cause
palpitations among a breed of men some say are noted for cheek rather
than chic, but it will be old hat to their colleagues in the North-east.
It was one year ago this month that Aberdeen City Council's licensing
committee decided to enforce a strict standard of dress on the ranks.
Shell-suits, track-suit bottoms with bright colours, collar-less shirts
and rude T-shirts were outlawed.
The guidelines state: ''Facial hair will be allowed if sported in an
acceptable fashion . . . designer stubble, or clear evidence that a
driver has not shaved with the regularity required for a clean-shaven
appearance will generally be regarded as unacceptable.''
The real reason behind the clean-up campaign was to remove
less-interested drivers from the city's already bulging ranks. So, is
too much emphasis placed on looking good while at work?
Kelly Barr has worked as a fashion stylist for Kylie Minogue and
Deacon Blue among others. ''Our police are always clean and smart and
dependable looking. It's British Rail and the Post Office workers who
really leave a lot to be desired. All the uniforms look shiny and
worn-through. It's like a school uniform you've had for five years.
''In Europe, particularly in Italy, all public workers have a touch of
style. We are improving but we still have not caught up.''
It's true. Many of today's post people have the appearance of having
lost a fight with a hedge. As one friend described it: ''My postman
looks like he mugged the real postman.'' Dark-blue jackets trimmed with
red might look groovy, but with the arms pulled off they resemble a
sack.
While many year-round postmen and women take pride in their
appearance, it is the seasonal staff who can pose problems. In the past
they were not issued with complete uniforms and so improvised with
track-suit bottoms, jeans, denim jackets and T-shirts. This, however, is
changing, as a spokesperson for the Royal Mail explained.
''We are now in the process of smartening them up. We think that we
could do better, particularly with seasonal workers, so we're issuing
them with shirts, blouses, trousers, pull-overs and waterproofs.''
On the early morning cat-walk, employees of Glasgow City Council's
cleansing department combine a trendy orange boiler suit with a green
and fluorescent anorak. Not only does the boiler-suit match the bus and
underground, but green has a freshness you seldom find around bins.
''It's about visibility, it's about see and be seen, it's about
safety,'' said Hugh Leishman of the council's press office. ''Of course,
they have their own taste in head gear, ranging from the knitted tammy
to the latest Armani -- whichever they care to buy for themselves.''
Style is not a word you would associate with modern policing,
especially once you have been confronted by the uniform. But it is
important to remember police officers have tingling fashion buds too;
not that they can ever be truly satisfied.
Only in the past few years have short-sleeve shirts appeared, while
the rules governing facial hair remain inviolate. ''You can have a
moustache but not a beard, unless on medical grounds, such as poor skin
which shaving irritates. Women, of course, have to be clean-shaven at
all times,'' joked a spokeswoman for Strathclyde Police.
''Style is important. You have to keep up to date. You just have to
compare it with the nineteenth century when we were running around in
capes. If you are wearing something that is not stylish then it does not
have the right image.''
Practicality and authority, though, remain the essential accoutrements
of today's police force. Female officers were forced to carry handbags
until four years ago because their uniforms didn't have enough pockets.
Such wrinkles have since been ironed out.
Attempts have been made to compare our dress sense with that of
Europeans. Their diets consist of cool, fresh salads -- so cool, fresh
clothes follow. And we have a dress sense that reflects our diet. Lard
and chips can leave us all looking like meat sealed in a sausage skin.
There is, as yet, no legislation governing poor dress sense.

TONY BLAIR has always known this would happen. He has refashioned the
Labour Party: reshaped its policies and its purpose, reinvigorated the
membership and restored its political credibility. And all it takes is
one Labour-controlled local authority to decide to sack its council
chiefs and give ''power to the people'' and the consequent row is
sufficient to knock the latest events in Croatia from the lead item in
the national news.
It was Labour's environment spokesman, Frank Dobson, who identified
the problem that is a headache for all political leaders of any party.
Most local authorities -- and he extended this to all parties -- run the
affairs of their area with commendable efficiency. ''There are some who
go astray,'' he said, ''including Tory ones.'' There are, in other
words, always going to be some silly burghers.
In the past few days there has been an upsurge in reports of the
''return of the loony left'' variety. It is a story which runs from time
to time; once it is a hot issue, every freelance journalist in every
town in the country will file incidents of loony tunes struck up by
local councils.
In Walsall, where the Labour National Executive Committee has decided
to suspend the district party, there have been concerns since Labour
took control in May about the way in which power is being administered.
The NEC empowered the party general secretary, Tom Sawyer, to act at its
meeting two weeks ago; after a weekend newspaper report detailing the
disquiet in the area with council policy, Mr Sawyer decided that time
had come.
It then only needed a couple of peripheral cases of questionable
Labour council policy to be aired for a full-blown ''story'' to be given
wings. In the current instance, the examples have been provided by
Coventry, where it has been decided to raise the awareness of sexist
stereotyping among all schoolchildren, and in Reading, where it is
proposed to ask people to inform on those of their neighbours they
suspect of defrauding the authorities.
The reality is that these kinds of policy have never actually gone
away, and the surprising thing is that the Conservative Party has not
made any attempt to play this political card before. It is the kind of
tactic that is particularly dear to Michael Heseltine -- and here there
is possibly a clue.
Tony Blair may have done much to bring about a party facelift, but he
has not yet secured such control over his existing membership that he
can prescribe the policies of local authorities -- any more than he can
guarantee that his own squeaky-clean approach to politics will not be
tarnished by the trades unions.
Similarly, his attempts to distance the party from its brotherhood
with the unions may have an effect in time, but only at the expense of
much heartache for those who value the historic importance of the
connection.
Labour has now been out of office for a generation and it is vital to
remember that many in the party are so anxious not to do anything to
inhibit Blair's chance of winning next time round that they will gladly
keep their lips zipped about any reservations they may foster. Those
reservations are, nevertheless, widespread.
In the meantime ''Old'' Labour is a sitting duck waiting for the
Conservative Party and its supporters in the press to take a pot shot.
Thus Dr Brian Mawhinney, the new Tory Party chairman, yesterday:
''Walsall is real Labour in power . . .'' ''Labour in local government
exposes the new Labour Party for the sham it really is . . .''
Of course, the Conservatives have been so caught up with their own
problems in recent months that they have not had any time, or pot shots,
to spare for the Opposition. But now they have declared that their
internal warfare is at an end and they have embarked upon a deliberate
policy of attempting to besmirch the political reputation of Tony Blair
and all his works.
We know that much because we were given notice a couple of weeks ago
by the newest member of the Cabinet, Roger Freeman. It was he who, when
advocating the advantages of rail privatisation, spoke of having cheap
and cheerful carriages for typists. It was he who, when congratulated by
a colleague on his wife having given birth to a new baby thought the
colleague was referring to his promotion in the Government and said,
dismissively, that he just happened to be the right chap in the right
place at the right time.
And, most recently, it was he who disclosed that a Cabinet
sub-committee, chaired by Mr Heseltine, deputy Prime Minister, First
Secretary and Lion King, would be meeting daily throughout the summer in
order to expose the weakness of the Labour Party's claim to assume the
government of the United Kingdom at the first opportunity.
As Cabinet sub-committees are staffed by supposedly impartial civil
servants, it was gently pointed out to Mr Freeman that this was party
political business that ought properly to belong in Smith Square.
Is it a coincidence that the affairs of Walsall were given an airing
in the national newspapers two days before Mr Mawhinney embarked on a
tour of the West Midlands? Who can say. What we do know is that the Tory
party is cranking up an overdue propaganda campaign and that, one way or
another, the campaign for next General Election has now begun.

LOOSENING the ties that bind Labour to its trade union hinterland may
fit the agenda of Tony Blair and his need to win votes in the South of
England, but does it jar with his traditional support north of the
Border? Is this a rerun of Clause IV? Will the Scots natives be more
restless?
The answer to each question is, broadly, yes -- the moves do continue
a process which creates unease, a feeling that events are moving beyond
the capacity of activists and trade unionists to respond. But do not
expect a rebellion. Even those who have doubts about the changes have
virtually thrown in the towel.
In today's New Labour Party, Tony Blair can probably push through just
about anything that he wants in broad policy terms, and there is no sign
that trade unions are mustering a final defence on the beach of MP
sponsorship as some kind of big issue.
Nevertheless, north of the Border there remain greater concerns,
fresher memories about policy change, deeper doubts about the whole
process of Mr Blair's modernisation programme and what it consigns to
the history books. No specific rebellion can be expected, but grist to
the mill of longer-term disputes are there for anyone to see.
The area of greatest resistance in Scotland will come if Labour HQ in
London attempts to sever completely the connection between an MP's
constituency and the union that wants to support it. Logic will dictate
that a pound spent in the Central Belt certainty is wasted if it could
help win a marginal in Ayr, Stirling or Aberdeen. But who calls the
shots? And what if the money goes to fight Basildon?
Jim Elsby, senior Scottish official of the Transport and General
Workers' Union, was particularly scathing yesterday. As regional
secretary designate of his union he cast doubt on the whole exercise and
accused the Labour leadership of dancing to a Tory tune, acquiescing in
the driving of a wedge between the party and the movement that brought
it into being.
''I think it's an over-reaction to Nolan because no money goes from
our organisation to MPs themselves,'' he said, ''but it will be seen by
my membership as another move by the Labour Party to distance themselves
from the trade unions.
''Once again they seem to have made knee-jerk reactions to situations
which really need a little more thought.
''The party seems to be saying 'give us your money, we will decide
what to do with it, you will have no say in where it is spent'. This is
all about driving a wedge between Labour and the unions.''
If the T&amp;G is at the sceptical end of the debate, the GMB union is in
the Blairite vanguard. Scottish political officer Duncan McNeill made
clear that they were not only behind the changes but had in effect
helped to initiate them.
He had few reservations about improving the way in which union aid is
targeted. Indeed, he pointed out that they had been pushing this process
through for some time and he used the vocabulary of the market -- ''bids
invited'' for ''specific projects'' in constituencies.
He was happy with the ''restructuring of the trade union link'' but
hinted at potential problems if London enforced the targets too
narrowly. Somewhere between the two lies the engineering union, the
AEEU.
Scottish political secretary Bill Tynan said the union had ''emptied
its bank account'' to try to help Labour win the last election, but it
also had links with specific MPs which it would be reluctant to
relinquish.
Motherwell North MP John Reid, although T&amp;G sponsored, believes the
unions should not over-react. With Conservative MPs pocketing cash for
consultancies, it was important for Labour MPs and trade unions to show
that there was no trading of influence. As for targeting marginal
constituencies, New Labour was already pursuing that ruthlessly.
Transparent funding from all sources, he suggested, was the aim. Would
the Conservatives dare to follow suit?

A FORMER assistant prison governor who lured teenage boys into taking
part in sex sessions at his home was jailed for five years yesterday.
Terrence Matthews, 61, kept a photographic record of his activities
and when police raided his cottage home, they found 21 albums of
pornographic pictures.
Matthews, of Backmuir of Lownie, Kingsmuir, near Forfar, admitted 12
charges of shameless indecency and lewd and libidinous practices
involving 12 teenage boys aged between 13 and 17, when he appeared at
the High Court in Aberdeen two weeks ago.
Lord Johnston deferred sentence until yesterday at the High Court in
Edinburgh, pending reports on Matthews, who has two previous convictions
for sexual offences in 1985 and 1987.
The judge was told that the offences took place between November 1991
and April this year.
Mr Alan Turnbull, Advocate-depute, said that when the offences began
Matthews was out of work and living on a Royal Navy pension. He had left
the Navy as a chief instructor in 1973 after 22 years' service and
served as an assistant governor at a prison in Kent.
Matthews, twice married with three children, had moved north after
being sacked for shoplifting while working for social services in Kent.
Mr Turnbull said Matthews had been in the habit of striking up
friendships with younger men and boys and inviting them to his home. He
would pretend to teach them self-defence and conduct of a sexual nature
would take place.
The offences came to light after the mother of one of the boys became
suspicious.
Jailing Matthews for five years, Lord Johnston told him it was plain
he had a problem but his overriding consideration had to be the
protection of the public.

BARRING a 20ft snowdrift that precludes the performers arriving, two
weeks on Friday the Kintyre Music Club will celebrate its jubilee with a
celebratory festival of five concerts featuring an array of Scottish
groups and performers.
In three days, beginning on Friday 25th, the 100-member club, which
has teamed up with five other music societies in Argyll, will host
concerts by a stellar line-up of Scottish musicians, including the BT
Scottish Ensemble, pianist Murray McLachlan, the Camerata Scotland --
fresh from their triumphant appearance at the Aberdeen International
Youth Festival -- the opera group, The Music Room, and the Strathclyde
Schools Symphony Orchestra.
The snowdrift in question was just one vicissitude faced by the
Kintyre club in its 50-year history. The club was formed by the local
minister and church organist following a series of hymn festivals, the
first held just before VE day. Initially the club bore the cumbersome
name of the Kintyre Branch of the Music Committee of the Scottish
Council of Social Services.
By 1948 the club had established a series of monthly meetings, with
the members literally making their own entertainment with concerts,
talks, and gramophone sessions. Additionally, there were four subsidised
concerts per year from the Arts Council's lists.
In the early days the club had no fixed base, which meant that the
venerable upright piano had to be carted from venue to venue.
Eventually, the club settled in Lochend Church (now demolished) and the
emphasis shifted from what the club has called ''DIY club nights'' to
professional concerts.
The festival weekend will present an unprecedented concentration of
musicians and performances that will have Campbeltown jumping. Local
input is strong, with concerts from area choirs, school and brass bands.
And, though the original founders have long gone, there is an element of
continuity in the club, whose honorary president is the son of the
original club secretary.
* The Kintyre Music Club Jubilee concerts are staged in the Lorne and
Lowland Church Hall, the Victoria Hall, the Royal Hotel, and the Picture
House. Full details from Campbeltown Tourist Office, 01586 552056.

Herald writers examine whether ending union sponsorship of MPs will
drive another wedge between 'Old' and 'New' Labour.
CHOOSE a word. Betrayal, compromise, or fudge. Take a headline. Apply
the chosen word and shake it all about. Voila -- the latest recipe for
Labour gripe; which rhymes with tripe. Yet, like all fanciful
concoctions, one prod at the artful dish of grumbles and it falls apart.
The news that Tony Blair wants an end to the practice of trade unions
sponsoring individual Labour MPs was served up yesterday as the proof of
the pudding: see, he wants to sever all links with the trade unions,
denude those decent bastions of democracy who, until recently, held 90%
of the votes at Labour's annual conference, of even a smidgeon of
influence in New Labour.
When you want to whip up a froth of a story it doesn't matter whether
the ingredients are fresh. Never mind that the trade unions will be
invited to sponsor constituencies instead of sitting MPs. Never mind
that the funds will be used to target marginal seats. Never mind that
the dish was a reheated hash, served up as a titbit scraped from an
interview given by that altogether meatier delicacy John Prescott,
himself a sponsored seamen's union MP, who foresaw no ''squalls'' over
its implementation. Nor that the appetiser was, in fact, served up by
Tony Blair to a press gallery lunch in the Commons before the
parliamentary recess last month.
He indicated then that he wanted to end sponsorship of individual MPs
by trade unions. It was a message already pressed home privately to
about 30 sponsored MPs who met with him in June to express concern at
his proposals.
It emerged three weeks ago that the Labour leadership had reached
broad agreement with union general secretaries in favour of such reform.
Mr Blair is pressing for the unions to transfer to the party's central
funds the money that currently goes to sponsored MPs. He believes
sponsorship of individuals sends out the wrong message and conflicts
with Lord Nolan's broad call for MPs not to be paid to act as advocates
in Parliament.
There are more than 180 Labour MPs who are sponsored by a trade union.
The three biggest sponsors are Unison, the Transport and General
Workers' Union and the GMB union. Under the 60-year-old Hastings
Agreement, the sponsorship money goes to the MP's constituency party,
not to the individual. A union will usually provide about #600 a year to
a sponsored MP's constituency party, and make a contribution to General
Election expenses.
In some cases, the sums are higher, perhaps enough to pay the salary
of an election agent or a researcher. Some unions also pay up to 75% of
election expenses, which more usually are paid for from constituency
funds. The money follows the MP. If he moves constituency, the
sponsorship follows.
Mr Blair believes removing the link between a union and an individual
will make it clearer that the money goes to the constituency party, not
to the MP. A working group of members of the Shadow Cabinet and general
secretaries of trade unions was set up to discuss future relationships
and consider sponsorship.
At last week's meeting of Labour's National Executive Committee, the
leadership successfully pressed through further reforms, by 22 votes to
three, to reduce further the trade unions' share of the vote at the
party conference, from 70% to 50%. It did so in line with a formula
agreed in 1992/93 to reflect a rapidly rising individual membership of
the party to above 300,000 which gives members and unions equal voting
power. Until as recently as 1992, union block votes held 90% of
conference votes.
And it was at last week's meeting that Mr Blair indicated that there
was broad agreement from general secretaries in favour of reform of
trade union sponsorship. The NEC's organisation committee will consider
detailed proposals in September. One option is to channel the money to a
central fund which could be directed to marginal seats. Opponents,
including some sponsored MPs, argue that the relationships with
individuals members is vital. They will get short shrift from the
leader.
People want strong, healthy, independent trade unions, Blair has said.
They just don't want to confuse them with an elected government. At last
week's NEC meeting he told colleagues the reason for Labour's decline
had been simple. It had lost touch. Society changed but Labour didn't.
The party's structures were out of date. The battle for what he called a
''quantum leap'' rather than minor change was far from over. He would
continue the pressure to transform the party's ideology, ideas and
constitution. Pegging back of union power is part of that project.
The unions were the midwives to a party which grew from a diffuse
bunch of people, ranging from workers' representatives to toffs with bad
consciences, into a broad church of a party. To be seen to be tinkering
with a historic compact between the diverse occupants of the pews is
seen as dabbling in its soul. But Blair carries with him no sentimental
baggage. He knows the distinction between owning your past and being
owned by it.
More than once, recently, he has said in speeches that when he asked
his constituency chairman whether the party would ''forgive the pain of
change'' he was told that the only thing the party would not forgive
would be losing.
For Mr Blair, at least, the real betrayal might come from those within
his party who continue to cherish its long history of heroic failure,
who would prefer to warm their principled souls in the glow of
convictions rather than face a cold douse from the reality of power. For
him, anyway, betrayal would be to lead Labour to another glorious
defeat.

A SCHOOLBOY who flew 7000 miles to Malaysia using his father's
passport was ordered yesterday to go to an attendance centre for 24
hours.
The 14-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was also given
a 12-month conditional discharge.
He admitted eight offences at Harrow Youth Court -- four of theft, two
of forgery, and one each of deception and handling.
The attendance centre order was for the Malaysia trip offences and the
conditional discharge for the other four.
Mr Anthony Swift, prosecuting, told the court the boy's parents, who
live in Harrow, Middlesex, reported their son to police on March 22
after discovering a key to a security cabinet had been copied.
Mr Swift said it appeared the boy had taken his father's credit card
and passport, bought a #499 ticket, and boarded a Malaysian Airlines
flight on February 21, having altered the passport.
Following his arrival in Kuala Lumpur, he travelled a further 200
miles to Jahore Bahru where he tried to check into the Puteri Pan
Pacific Hotel.
He had become the subject of a massive search involving Interpol and
the British High Commission and was returned to the UK. Four days before
his disappearance, he had been discovered by police at the airport
waiting for a flight to Paris. He had used his father's credit card to
obtain French but no action was taken, said Mr Swift.
About a month later, his parents went to the police in Harrow to
report his conduct after discovering he had a key to the security
cabinet.
Urging an attendance centre order, the boy's solicitor, Mr Patrick
Cusack, told the bench the boy was now contrite, although he had
originally made no comment when interviewed by police, and wanted to
make some reparation.

JACK of all musical trades and master of many, Sir Charles Mackerras
is approaching his 70th birthday. He has become a stalwart of the
Edinburgh Festival where his performances never fail to excite curiosity
and discussion. On the eve of this year's Festival, where the tireless
Sir Charles will undertake marathon concerts featuring the music of
Mozart and Dvorak, Conrad Wilson profiles the great man
LIKE George Szell before him, Sir Charles Mackerras, at the age of 70,
could say that he specialises in not being a specialist. He conducts
Purcell, Bach, Schubert, Dvorak, Verdi, Wagner, Puccini, and Strauss
with equal aplomb.
His arrival in Britain, from his native Australia, was signalled
almost 50 years ago by a ballet entitled Pineapple Poll, for which he
arranged and cleaned up some of Sullivan's loveliest melodies just after
the music had gone out of copyright. Sullivan enthusiasts, fearing
vulgarisation, were forced to admit that the result was seductively
successful.
It could be said that Mackerras has been cleaning up music ever since.
Mozart, Handel, and Janacek in particular have come under his scrutiny,
starting with his landmark performances of The Marriage of Figaro at
Sadler's Wells in 1965, in which he pioneered what we would now call
period-style interpretation of Mozart's operas long before anyone else
got round to it.
Appoggiaturas and embellishments were lavished upon music that had
formerly been performed plain, tempi were conspicuously increased and
rhythms abrasively sharpened. And just in case anybody failed to get the
message, he wrote his own manifesto in Opera magazine provocatively
entitled What Mozart Really Meant.
Suddenly, traditional Mozart performances, in the Viennese manner
upheld by Karl Boehm, seemed unacceptably stodgy. What Mackerras did for
Mozart he then proceeded to do for Handel, slimming Messiah down to size
in a way that would have displeased Sir Malcolm Sargent, but which made
exhilarating sense of the music. Through the gateway opened by Sir
Charles, other conductors -- John Eliot Gardiner, Christopher Hogwood,
Trevor Pinnock -- soon sprinted, but it was Mackerras who set the
example and showed what was possible.
For somebody who was not a specialist, in the narrow musicological
sense of the word, it was a remarkable achievement. Most conductors,
after all, tend to accept things as they are. Turning their backs on
progress, they leave the fine detail of 18th-century style to be sorted
out by scholars and then proceed to ignore the resultant discoveries
(Sir Colin Davis's conducting of Mozart today sounds heavier and more
irrelevant than it did 30 years ago).
Sir Charles was among the first modern conductors to dismiss tradition
-- in Mahler's famous word -- as slovenliness, and to do something about
it. But how did it happen that an Australian born in Schenectady, New
York -- where his father, having emigrated to America, worked briefly as
an electrical engineer -- became not only a distinguished omni-purpose
conductor (capable, as he once proved at the London Coliseum, of
conducting The Ring at short notice) but also a world expert on aspects
of musical authenticity?
The early turning-point in his career was his decision, at the age of
21, to come to Britain and try his luck. Until then, he had been an
oboist in the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, with aspirations to conduct.
The Second World War was only just over. Britain was in the throes of
austerity and much of Europe still in chaos. But like many another
ambitious Australian, he knew that he needed European experience as the
launching pad for his career.
As an oboist, and as an Australian of Scottish descent, he worked
initially with the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra under Ian Whyte, and
on tour with Sadler's Wells Opera. Then came the offer he had been
waiting for. Having named Sir Malcolm Sargent and Sir Adrian Boult as
his referees without asking their permission, he won a post-graduate
scholarship to Prague, enabling him to study under Vaclav Talich, the
Dvorak expert and doyen of the Czech Philharmonic.
As a young, recently married man, he had to weigh up the wisdom of the
offer, and bureaucracy did not make things easy for him. Fearing that he
might try to stretch his meagre allowance to two people, the British
Council's Prague office sent a telegram saying ''On No Account Bring
Wife'' (she went with him all the same).
So soon after the war, Czechoslovakia was hardly the most inviting
country to visit. But it was -- as Mackerras recognised -- a deeply
musical one. Beyond its frontiers, however, only a handful of Czech
works, most of them by Dvorak, were widely known. Mackerras decided that
his mission was to rectify this, and it was through the music of Janacek
that he did so.
If Janacek today is a pillar of the British operatic repertoire, it is
Mackerras above all who should be thanked for it. To start with, he was
attracted simply by the challenge of deciphering Janacek's music, much
of it crudely scrawled, filled with amendments, and notorious for
instrumental demands so apparently unintelligible that performers could
not cope with them.
But what, to Mackerras, made it irresistible was the passion of the
music, along with the bizarre subjects Janacek chose for his operas and
his unique way of setting words. A chance to hear Talich conduct Katya
Kabanova in Prague soon convinced him that here was a composer whose
works should be heard in every opera house in the world.
Accordingly, when he returned to London, he took with him the score of
Katya and conducted its British premiere in London in 1953. It was a
shot in the dark. Audiences took time to respond to music the like of
which they had never heard before. But Mackerras persevered, going on to
conduct the British premiere of The Makropoulos Affair a few years
later.
The more he conducted Janacek, however, the more he recognised that
the printed scores were crammed with mistakes and ambiguities -- the
product of the composer's untidy, impatient handwriting -- that
prevented the music from making its proper effect. His thirst for
accuracy convinced him that perfected versions were urgently needed, and
rather than wait for someone else to edit them he edited them himself.
Mackerras's pertinacity is what has made him the musician he is. At
worst, it can bring a certain dryness to his conducting, when his desire
to get at the truth of a work sometimes blinds him to its beauty. His
fleet tempi, founded on his knowledge of classical style, can sometimes
make the resultant performance seem like a journey straight down the M1,
eyes fixed on the windscreen while the scenery flashes by.
But more often the effect is thrilling and revelatory, impelling you
to say ''Yes, that's how the music should sound''. Far from not being a
specialist, Mackerras in fact specialises in everything he touches. That
is what makes him the man he is, even if, in order to pursue his special
interests, he has shunned the long-term directorship of any one
orchestra or opera company.

SIX men were refused bail amid tight security at Falkirk Sheriff Court
yesterday when they made a second appearance charged with terrorist
offences.
The six are charged with conspiracy to procure guns, ammunition, and
explosives and plotting to support the outlawed Ulster Volunteer Force
by criminal means.
Armed police stood guard as a motorcade of five police vans, two
patrol cars and four motorcycle outriders brought the accused to court
from Barlinnie.
Each man made a 10-minute appearance in private before Sheriff J
Irvine Smith.
Depute procurator-fiscal Malcolm Stewart said none of them made any
plea or declaration. They were fully committed.
Under Scots law, trial must take place within 110 days of their
original detention.
The accused are: Mr John Johnston, 48, of Campbell Crescent,
Laurieston, Falkirk, Stirlingshire; Mr Francis Hives, 44, of Prescott
Road, Liverpool; Mr William McArthur, 40, of Ure Crescent, Bonnybridge,
Stirlingshire; Mr David White, 29, of Northburn Avenue, Airdrie,
Lanarkshire; Mr Alexander Davidson, 23, of Greenhill Park: land; and Mr
Lindsay Robb, 28, of Mournview Avenue, both of Lurgan, Northern Ireland.
All six are likely to appeal against the refusal of bail.
Solicitor Iain Armstrong for Mr Hives, confirmed that his client
Francis Hives is the licensee of the Cattle Market Public House in
Liverpool, where part of the conspiracy is said to have taken place.
The petition alleges that the six plotted to further the aims of the
Ulster Volunteer Force by criminal means at the Cattle Market pub and
the Tam Bain pub in Laurieston, Falkirk, and elsewhere in the UK between
January 1 and July 24.
It is alleged they conspired between themselves and with others to
unlawfully acquire firearms, ammunition, and explosives, intending to
endanger life and cause serious injury to property or to enable others
to do so.
Mr Robb is charged with passing Mr Davidson two bullets in the Tam
Bain, knowing or having reason to suspect that they might be used for
the purposes of terrorism in Northern Ireland.
The Crown alleges that Mr Davidson later had two bullets in his
possession at the Sea Cat terminal at Stranraer, with intent to endanger
life or property.
The three central Scotland men, Mr Johnston, Mr McArthur, and Mr
White, are alleged to have solicited guns and ammunition from Mr Hives
at the Cattle Market pub.
Mr Hives is alleged to have made guns and ammunition available,
suspecting they might be used for terrorism.
Mr Johnston, Mr McArthur, and Mr White are accused of possessing guns
and ammunition in Aitchison Street, Airdrie. The petition alleges they
had an FEG 9mm self-loading pistol, a 9mm automatic machine pistol, two
magazines, and 33 bullets.

NIGEL Benn will make the ninth defence of his WBC super-middleweight
title against America's Steve Little at Wembley Stadium on September 2.
It will be Benn's second defence in the space of 42 days after
stopping Italy's Vincenzo Nardiello at the London Arena last month.
Little is a former holder of the WBA version of the 12-stone title,
claiming it as underdog against Michael Nunn in February last year.
But Little did not have long to capitalise on his shock win and lost
his crown to the current holder Frankie Liles.
Benn against Little backs Frank Bruno's fourth attempt to win a world
heavyweight title, against Chicago's WBC champion Oliver McCall.
* AMERICAN Tony Ganerelli was yesterday confirmed as Eamonn Loughran's
new opponent for the fourth defence of his WBO welterweight title at
Belfast's Ulster Hall on August 26.
Ulsterman Loughran was due to fight South African Luvuyo Kakaza last
Saturday, but the clash was called off after the challenger failed an
eye test.

AMERICAN pianist extraordinaire Dick Hyman is the best bargain on the
jazz market: for the price of a ticket to hear him, you also get to hear
the likes of Fats Waller, Art Tatum and Erroll Garner -- to name but a
few. On Monday afternoon in a packed Cotton Club, Hyman's remit was to
provide a history of jazz piano -- something this Honky Tonk Professor
has got down to a fine art.
He started where many fans' jazz education begins -- with ragtime. A
storming version of Scott Joplin's revolutionary Maple Leaf Rag was
beautifully balanced by his subtler, utterly exquisite and deeply
introspective tango, Solace, both of which Hyman played with
characteristic elegance.
The set flowed naturally from one innovator to the next. So accurate
were Hyman's recreations of their techniques that it was only the sight
of his nimble, white fingers that shattered the aural illusion that the
ghosts of jazz piano past were all gathered in the same room.
The most dazzling displays of the Hyman touch were two of the frenetic
fingerbusting numbers -- Jelly Roll Morton's fast, furious and
incredibly complex Shreveport Stomp and a breathtaking version of James
P Johnson's Carolina Shout. Both demanded a great deal of digital energy
and both seemed to provoke in Hyman a bemused, if not fiendish, facial
expression: he watched his hands as if they were attached to someone
else's arms.
Hyman's history lesson, which had to end circa 1945, was undoubtedly
the highlight of the festival thus far, and a hard act to follow. Of the
Pianorama participants who took the stage after him, Edinburgh's own
Brian Kellock came closest -- with a superb stridey Manhattan.

MUSIC is taken very seriously in Finland, to judge from the
performances by the Impromptu Youth String Orchestra from Helsinki, one
of the youngest groups attending this year's Aberdeen International
Youth Festival.
They are firmly drilled in all the technical niceties of string
playing -- Handel's Concerto Grosso in C minor and Haydn's 27th Symphony
were both neatly clipped and cleanly played under the firm control of
conductor Olli-Pekka Haavisto. But the young players were all so
serious, and only when 11-year-old Salla Harju came skipping on stage as
soloist in Sibelius's Suite for Violin and Strings did her smile and
obvious enjoyment of playing bring sunshine to the music.
Harju's sense of phrasing and tonal colour were natural and relaxed;
Elgar's Serenade for Strings should have been the most relaxed of pieces
too, yet its opening was taut, and only well into the work did the upper
strings finally take to the air.
More successful altogether was Thomas Wilson's Saint Kentigern Suite.
This was a brave undertaking, played under the eagle eye of the composer
himself, seated a few rows back in the audience. It was well performed,
with the contrasting sense of motion in each movement clearly defined,
leading to the magical moment where a plainsong melody enters to
announce the final movement that carries the emotional charge of the
work.
To finish, it was back home to Finland with the Impromptu for Strings
by Sibelius. It was warmly played but still without a smile.

<TEXT>
SHETLAND Islands Council yesterday offered to sacrifice a major source
of income in a bid to save the threatened Sullom Voe oil terminal.
Councillors made the announcement at a meeting with bosses of the
terminal in a bid to fend off fierce competition from offshore loading
operations.
The North Sea industry claims offshore loading of oil onto tankers is
#16m a year cheaper than piping it back to Sullom Voe.
However, councillors fear that loss of business at the terminal would
devastate the local economy, causing a savage increase in unemployment.
Council chief executive Malcolm Green refused to reveal where the
money would be saved in the council's offer but it is thought to centre
on a reduction in the terminal's reported #13m annual rates bill.
Savings may also be made on the terminal's #7.6m rent and package of
payments to the council, which includes disturbance fees.
The council's objective is to ensure the terminal remains the
transhipment point for the Brent and Ninian oil systems and is
attractive to new developments West of Shetland.
In return for the savings, it has asked for guarantees that the Brent
and Ninian systems will continue to use the terminal after the year
2000.
It also wants permission for council-appointed experts to examine the
physical condition of the terminal and investigate levels of spending,
and for greater involvement in the strategic decisions affecting the
terminal and in the future marketing of Sullom Voe.

GIRLS' OPEN
VICKI Lang has qualified for the matchplay stages of the British
Girls' Open Amateur championship at Northop Park in Clwyd -- at the
tender age of 14.
The Musselburgh Grammar School girl shot rounds of 75 and 79 for a 154
total. ''I played really well and am thrilled to have qualified,'' said
the 4-handicapper, who is coached by Jane Connachan, herself a former
British Girls' champion.
She was one of several Scottish success stories on a day when many
competitors in the 90-strong field found the Northop Park course too
tought a test.
Deeside's Claire Hunter, a 17-year-old schoolgirl who reached the
final of the Scottish championship, was delighted to make progress on
149, just six strokes adrift of top qualifier Rebecca Hudson.
Other Scottish qualifiers were Heather Stirling, Laura Moffat and
Fiona Lockhart. Scottish aggregates:
149 -- C Hunter (Deeside) 72, 77. 154 -- V Lang (Musselburgh) 75, 79.
156 -- L Moffat (West Kilbride) 77, 79. 157 -- F Lockhart (Balbirnie
Park) 73, 84; H Stirling (Bridge of Allan) 78, 79.
Scottish non-qualifiers: 163 -- K Burns (Clydebank and District). 169
-- L Mackay (Golspie). 175 -- P Mackay (Golspie). 177 -- L Vass (Tain).

SCULPTURE should be seen in situ, and Kildrummy Castle in Strathdon, a
ruined Jacobite stronghold, provides a dynamic backdrop for these 14
exhibits by selected artists from Great Britain and beyond, four of whom
are displaying invited works which are to remain in North-east sites.
Attracting young experimental artists, their visible enthusiasm and
creativity encourage you to get involved with their work, using the vast
hilly space to enjoy both individual pieces and the entire show. Peter
Bevan's Gazebo, a hollow-built representation of a human figure, is the
most interactive, as you can step into its cocoon and peer out through
its many haphazardly pieced holes.
Here are comments on humanity, society and the organic world -- Laura
White's Breathe is a hatched limestone pod whose slug has travelled down
the grass bank, while Charles Polson's Soft Machine is disturbing -- its
green and pink concrete piled like damp, mouldy rolls of blankets.
There is past and present history -- Diane Maclean's Shoe echoes the
tower of an ancient castle, and Agneta Stening's Throne of the Horn is a
granite echo of Cretan history.
The most memorable piece for me is by Iain McColl (official assistant
war artist with Peter Howson in Bosnia), who models his piece on the
notorious Bosnian gang who attack travellers -- the Fishhead Gang, three
looming black-hooded figures whose thin-shaped heads, blown by the wind,
follow you around.
Joseph Ingleby is the humourist of the group -- Reservoir Tap with its
steel vat and flower-like lid is an almost abstract, organic form. This
exhibition transfers next month to the MacRobert Art Centre at Stirling
University where it will be on show until December.

THE Knoydart Foundation, a community-led organisation, was set up
yesterday aimed at securing a sustainable future for Knoydart, Britain's
last great wilderness area.
The 16,000-acre Knoydart Estate is up for sale -- for the third time
in a decade.
Bids of around #3m are expected for the estate and interested local
groups met representatives of two trusts for talks in Mallaig to put
forward a six-point plan for Knoydart's future.
Along with Knoydart Community Association, Lochaber District Council,
and Highland Regional Council delegates, were office-bearers of the John
Muir Trust and the Chris Brasher Trust.
Former Olympic athlete Chris Brasher, who was at the meeting, has
previously expressed interest in ensuring that the welfare of Knoydart
peninsula and its 75 residents is looked after.
Development of Knoydart's land resources, crofting interests, private
tourism, initiatives, and its heritage aspects are seen as integral
requirements for any new owner.
However, Councillor Charlie King, of Mallaig, who chaired the meeting,
said later: ''It is extremely unlikely that the Knoydart Foundation will
be able to make an offer for the estate by the closing date set by the
vendor, which we believe to be September 30.''
The present owners are Knoydart Peninsula Ltd, a branch of the
Titaghur jute giant, whose chairman, Mr Reg Brealey, is also chairman of
Sheffield United FC.

US PGA Championship
THIS year the shuffling of the deck of cards to produce the last two
or three places on Europe's Ryder Cup team to meet the United States
next month has come to resemble nothing so much as that most famous of
all useless activities, rearranging the deckchairs on the Titanic.
Yesterday, hard on the heels of the withdrawals of Bernhard Langer and
David Gilford (both assured of places) and Zimbabwean Mark McNulty from
the US PGA championship, which begins tomorrow at the Riviera Country
Club near Los Angeles, Ian Woosnam expressed disappointment that
Jose-Maria Olazabal was unwilling to show greater commitment to the
cause.
The injury to his right foot which has haunted Olazabal all year has
meant his only tournament appearance in the last six weeks was in the
Open Championship. Moreover, this event, the last to count so far as the
American side is concerned, also will be Olazabal's final chance to
consolidate or improve on tenth in Europe's list.
That is the last of the automatic places and since Bernard Gallacher
will have to use up one of his two captain's selections on Nick Faldo --
almost certainly, unless he finishes first or second here -- the need
for Olazabal and, indeed, Woosnam himself, currently twelfth, to play
themselves in would, normally, be imperative.
Olazabal's fitness, however, continues as a compromising factor. Yet,
instead of returning to Europe to compete in either or both of the last
two counting tournaments, in Czechoslovakia and Germany, he will play
twice in America, in the International, a stableford-style event, and
then as defender in the World Series of Golf.
Woosnam said of Olazabal, who has been a wild card in three of his
four Ryder Cup appearances: ''It's up to him, but it's unfortunate he's
not making more of an effort.''
Olazabal, visibly lame merely walking through the locker room,
admitted to ''a delicate situation''. He added: ''If I make the team,
I'll discuss it with Bernard. I would hope to be fit, but if I don't
think I will be I'll tell him I shouldn't play.''
And there lies the nub of this dilemma, which the self-inflicted, and
obviously self-defeating, decision to reduce the captain's options from
three to two needlessly created. Lacking the cutting edge of
competition, Olazabal's short game has suffered particularly and that he
is still taking anti-inflammatory medication and applying ice packs is
hardly reassuring.
Woosnam, susceptible himself to recurring bouts of back trouble, is,
apart from his putting, currently in fine fettle. Yesterday he played in
practice with Colin Montgomerie and Sam Torrance, all of them having
their first look at this delightful 6949-yard course laid out on the
floor of a canyon not far from the Pacific Ocean.
Unfortunately, Torrance was unable to complete more than eight holes.
He had complained of an upset stomach before going out and on the ninth
tee felt so unwell in the rising temperatures that he had to be driven
from the course and given medication before returning to his hotel.
Torrance was relieved that Montgomerie, second in Sweden, did not
overtake him in first place on the European Order of Merit which in more
than 20 years on the Tour Torrance has never won. Sandy Lyle, who has
done so three times and is playing on a special invitation, went out
with Phil Mickelson, Craig Stadler, and Hal Sutton.

IT'S not often George Melly's attire can be described as easy on the
eye and, sure enough, the something cool he promised to slip into after
the interval turned out to be a word from his sponsors. And that word
wasn't ''shhh''. Good-time George may have been beginning to see the
light. Me? I was beginning to see candy stripes when I shut my eyes.
They call him Good-Time George, he says, because of his appetite for
wine, women, and . . . sheep. They also introduced him as Britain's
foremost jazz entertainer. Not singer, note. After all, the gags can
take longer than the songs. Both are delivered in that trademark rich
plummy growl, with much rolling of the eyes to emphasise their
ruggedness. Then with a camp wave of the hand he'll lurch off to his
seat while John Chilton's Feetwarmers play their adroit slippers-on
swing.
Songs by Bessie Smith, Hoagy Carmichael, and Fats Waller arrive
between impressions of a barmaid, a rabbit, and Mick Jagger, and the
band earn brownie points for keeping to the script in the face of a
one-person riot in the cheap seats. But even if his onstage movements
are no longer as athletic as his former Frankie and Johnny routine, it
takes more than rudeness to throw Good Time off his stride.
Besides, when it comes to rudeness (in his case, good humoured), Good
Time already has a plentiful supply.

<HEADLINE>Manufacturing picks up as North Sea output falls</HEADLINE>

A MIXED bag of output figures for June showed that a
maintenance-related fall in North Sea oil output had hit industrial
production, but its manufacturing component picked up.
Of particular significance were the upward revisions to previous
figures for manufacturing output in April and May. As a result
manufacturing grew by 0.5% in the second quarter more than reversing a
fall of 0.1% in the first.
Analysts have been puzzled by the strength of the survey evidence
emerging from the likes of the Confederation of British Industry in
contrast to the weakness of the official readings of manufacturing
output.
The latest revisions to the historic figures confirm that the Central
Statistical Office has been under-recording output. This is probably
caused by problems with the trade figures.
Output in May was revised up by 0.4% and in April by 0.2%. In June the
manufacturing sector grew by 0.2%, a little below expectations. But the
revisions to the historic figures have resulted in a stronger picture
emerging.
Year-on-year growth in manufacturing was 2.4%, about 0.4% higher than
had been expected. In the latest three-month period, manufacturing was
2.3% higher than in the same three months a year ago. There is still a
discrepancy between the official data and the CBI survey evidence, which
could result in further revisions.
There was some speculation that the manufacturing figures might have
been strong enough to push the second quarter non-oil gross domestic
product estimate up by 0.1% from its current 0.7% increase. Total GDP,
including oil and gas extraction, grew by 0.6% in the period.
A feature of the manufacturing figures was the buoyancy of consumer
industries, which sported growth of 1.3% between the latest two quarters
and 3% against the second quarter of 1994.
Comparable figures for investment industries were 0.4% and 2.2%
respectively. Intermediate goods industries recorded a fall of 0.4% in
the second quarter, but were 1% higher than in the same quarter a year
ago.
The strong performance by the consumer industries could be the first
tentative sign that consumer spending is coming back to life after being
held in check by tax increases and higher interest rates. It is also
possible that the figures could be boosted by involuntary stockbuilding.
Next week's figures on retail sales and the retail price index might
shed further light on the situation. There are anecdotal reports that
discounting in the summer sales has been shallow and short-lived.
James Capel economists are forecasting a 0.4% increase in July's
retail sales after the flat trend in July. The data will give the first
glimpse of how the economy may be performing in the third quarter.
The manufacturing figures showed that the strongest growth came in
food, drink, and tobacco, and in engineering. The food sector grew by
1.6% in the quarter and its output was 3.2% higher than in the second
quarter of last year. Comparable figures for engineering were 0.4% and
3.4% respectively.
The worst sector was textiles, leather, and clothing where output fell
by 0.8% in the quarter and was 1.3% lower than in the same quarter a
year ago.
Industrial production comprises mining and quarrying (which includes
oil and gas extraction) and electricity, gas, and water, as well as
manufacturing. Electricity, gas, and water increased output by 1% in the
second quarter and was 2.5% higher than in the second quarter of 1994.
North Sea oil and gas extraction fell by 6.7% in June taking it down
to its lowest level since early last year. The Royal Bank of Scotland
oil and gas index had given early warning that maintenance work was
taking its toll of oil output.
In the second quarter, oil and gas extraction fell by 4.5% and was
only 0.1% higher than in the same period in 1994. By contrast, coal is
showing signs of recovery with output in the quarter 13.2% higher than
in the first and 6.2% higher than in the second quarter of 1994.
Overall mining and quarrying output fell by 3% in the second quarter
and was 0.7% higher than in the second quarter a year ago. As a result
the overall industrial production figures were weak, notwithstanding the
recovery in its main manufacturing constituent.
In June industrial production fell by 0.3%, though this was entirely
attributable to the sharp drop in oil and gas extraction. There were
upward revisions to the figures for April and May, and as a result
industrial production edged ahead by 0.1% in the quarter for growth of
2.1% on the same quarter a year ago.
The economy has undoubtedly slowed down from the hectic pace of last
year, but it is not clear whether this will continue into the second
half of the year or whether activity will start to pick up again.
Most economists expect consumer demand to stage a recovery from its
recent weakness, but the timing is a matter of speculation.
As a result the row between the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth
Clarke, and the Governor of the Bank of England, Eddie George, over
interest rates is likely to drag on.
Goldman Sachs' Martin Brooks said: ''With the housing market remaining
weak, stronger evidence of above trend growth in the economy and a rise
in inflationary pressures will be needed before the Chancellor becomes
convinced off the need for a further tightening in monetary policy. This
is probably still some months way.''
In effect interest rate policy will be determined by the strength or
weakness of activity in the third quarter. It is likely to be closer to
Budget time in November before rates need to be increased (or reduced,
as the bears of the economy would argue).

THE first projects in a five-year, European-backed rural development
programme for the north of Scotland are expected to receive the green
light within the next eight weeks, according to development agency
Highlands and Islands Enterprise.
HIE will co-ordinate delivery of the Leader II initiative, following
yesterday's announcement by the Scottish Office that European aid worth
#9m had been secured.
A further #14m, from other public and private sector sources, is
expected to be unlocked by the programme, led by HIE on behalf of the
Scottish Office and European Commission. Local enterprise companies in
the HIE Network will play a key role at community level, providing
matching funding and expertise for projects.
At the heart of the programme will be local action groups, which bring
together enterprise companies, local authorities, community groups, and
other bodies.
HIE's head of European affairs, Mr Frank Gaskell, said the success of
the #23m initiative would depend on the drive and imagination of local
communities.
Mr Gaskell said: ''This is very much a community-based programme with
the emphasis on stimulating projects at grassroots level. The European
funding, allied to resources from the HIE Network, local authorities,
Scottish Natural Heritage, and other bodies, will provide a significant
financial boost over the next five years.''
The initiative follows the successful pilot Leader I programme, which
ended last year following joint investment of #9m in more than 500
projects in six areas of the Highlands and Islands.
The European funding breakdown for the Highlands and Islands is:
Shetland #800,000; Orkney #700,000; Western Isles/Skye and Lochalsh
(joint programme) #2.5m; Caithness and Sutherland #400,000; Ross and
Cromarty #1m; Inverness and Nairn (rural areas) #400,000; Moray,
Badenoch, and Strathspey #400,000; Lochaber #1m; Argyll and the Islands
#1.4m.

MISTER Westsound, who won in controversial circumstances at Ayr on
Saturday, makes a quick re-appearance at Hamilton Park this evening in
the Cameronians Handicap.
Despite a violent collision with Diet, which had repercussions for at
least two other fancied runners, Linda Perratt's three-year-old was
allowed to keep the race.
The inexperience of apprentice John Bramhill, subsequently banned for
eight days, showed on that occasion, but tonight Mister Westsound has
the benefit of George Duffield in the saddle. A slow starter, he comes
with a late surge inside the final furlong, and despite a penalty of 7lb
should win again.
Bramhill is given another chance by Miss Perratt, partnering Sunday
Mail Too in the Scottish Rifles Apprentice Handicap.
The William Hill Handicap over an extended mile has attracted a field
of 12 which includes three course specialists.
Talented Ting, has won over the course and distance five times, and
although he has maximum weight, should figure in the finish.
Locally-owned King Curan and Sir Arthur Hobbs have won over a mile three
times at Hamilton, while Three Arch Bridge was successful here 10 days
ago.
It is a very open race with Legal Fiction and Sarmatian, on their
previous form over this distance, also in with a chance.
Nornax Lad, who held on well to beat Lord Hastie by a neck in the
Langs Supreme Handicap here six days ago, returns from Martin Meade's
Wiltshire yard for the Orbiston Limited Stakes.
He concedes 12lb to Red Spectacles, ridden by Jason Weaver, and second
on both his previous runs here. Patrick Haslam's three-year-old reared
in the stalls when beaten half a length by Eden Dancer and two weeks
earlier went down by a neck to Twin Creeks. Given a bit of luck he
should win this time.
Keep Your Distance, an impressive winner at Ayr three weeks ago,
tackles the longer distance of one mile and five furlongs in the Earnock
Handicap. Mrs Reveley's five-year-old has Kevin Darley on board and
should cope with the 7lb penalty.
He won over this course and at Catterick last year, and has also been
successful over hurdles for owner Peter Savill.
Chief executive Hazel Dudgeon is delighted to have 48 runners on the
card, an exceptional response in view of the small fields at many
meetings recently.

IF John Browne continues as he has started as BP's new chief executive
-- with a one-third increase in the quarterly dividend to 4p -- he is
destined to be popular with shareholders.
The dividend boost means that the group has almost made good the
dramatic cut of 1992. Shareholders taking scrip dividends instead of
cash are already ahead.
Mr Browne has started his stint on a positive note, reporting record
second-quarter profits. Net income before exceptionals rose from #335m
to #519m on a replacement cost basis, which ignores stock movements,
making the first-half total 53% ahead at #980m.
Mr Browne said the dividend had been increased because of BP's strong
financial base, its sustainable and improving performance, its
resilience to adverse market conditions and the ''wealth of
opportunities'' for profitable growth.
The higher profits stem from a better oil price, improved margins in
chemicals and further productivity gains. Average crude prices were
$2.50 higher at $17.3 a barrel, though they have since dropped back to
the lower end of BP's projected range of $16-$18.
Despite this, group chairman Sir David Simon said the external
environment was ''encouraging'', with volumes generally still moving
forward. BP's oil production in the second quarter was lower owing
mainly to maintenance in the North Sea and reduced gas volumes as a
result of over-supply to the market. This will be eased when the
interconnector link with the continent comes on stream in 1988.
Over the long term, BP is confident of finding new reserves to meet
demand, with good discoveries coming from Vietnam, Colombia, and the
Gulf of Mexico, while more immediately there are continuing developments
in the North Sea, Alaska, Colombia, and Venezuela. Production is set to
grow by 2% per annum over several years. BP is confident of being able
to replace reserves as they are used up for the next decade at least.
One feature of Mr Browne's regime is going to be joint ventures with
other oil companies. He was enthusiastic about the co-operation with
Shell west of Shetland and the Gulf of Mexico as it brought together the
skills of both companies. This was preferable to acquisitions which were
''tough to do''.
Second-quarter exploration and production operating profits were 13%
up at #540m, an increase dwarfed by the continuing dramatic recovery in
chemicals, where profits jumped from #45m to #258m. Margins and volumes
remained firm and plant reliability was high on a reduced cost base.
In contrast to the last cycle there is no sign of major new capacity
to come in Europe, which suggests the picture should remain firm for
some time.
Refining and marketing was 14% ahead at #133m, with margins showing
some recovery from the very low levels of the first quarter as industry
supply tightened. In this sector there is more capacity in sight so
prospects are less bright.
BP's productivity drive is on target, aiming to deliver a sustainable
#1870m of profit improvement by next year, with much already achieved.
As seen by the dividend increase, shareholders are getting their reward,
with the shares at 473[1/2], up 3[1/2]p, yielding 4.2%.

LAST week I wrote my column from Aberdeen, and this week I would have
written it from Orkney, had not urgent business summoned me back to the
grindstone. Duty calls, as they say, but I would rather still be at the
Taversoe Hotel on Rousay, guzzling Mrs Preston's delicious home cooking
and working my way through Mr Preston's wine cellar, with nothing but
cosmic views over the Sound of Eynhallow and the singing of the seals to
distract me.
What all this unplanned dashing about has done, however, is allow me
to survey different modes of transport in Scotland as a tourist
experiences them. Having had to part from my American travelling
companions and our hired car at Thurso, I entrusted myself to ScotRail.
This experience was by far the worst. That may be a little unfair,
because it was also the longest, and the unpleasantness of a journey
inevitably increases with its distance. In this case, there should
perhaps be a competition with a first prize of one hour with ScotRail,
down to a seventh prize of seven hours with ScotRail, which was what I
had. The network, at any rate, seems ill-equipped to deal with the
long-distance traveller over the remoter parts of our wunnerful country.
I was prepared for my stomach to be tortured, and had taken the
precaution of eating an enormous Orcadian breakfast before I left. I was
very glad I did. I boarded the midday train from Thurso, and waited for
the trolley to come trundling along. I found it bore precisely two
sandwiches. Being a public-spirited chap, I only ate one of them, and
left the other to be divided among the remaining 100 or so passengers.
With the change of trains at Inverness, there was just time for a
plate of haddock and chips in the station buffet with its greasy,
uncleared tables and blaring pop music. I felt sure the haddock was
coley, by the way, but we shall let that pass. Then I pressed on
southwards, pressed being the operative word, as in a hot, crowded
carriage I contorted my ample frame into a midget's seat. The decrepit
old rolling stock on the northerly line had been, in that respect at
least, more comfortable. The journey as a whole turned out to be sheer
torture, however, and if I have to do it again I shall certainly fly.
Who would put up with it, apart from tourists who put up with it just
once? This was a matter that interested me because the line from Thurso
to Inverness obviously stands under threat of eventual closure, even if
ScotRail does not care to say so. I took the trouble to walk from end to
end of my train to see how many genuine Highlanders I could spot. There
were not many, most of them old ladies.
One man in shorts jumped on at Brora and ran frantically up and down
distributing a brochure for his B&amp;B before alighting 10 minutes later at
Golspie. But the great majority were foreign students with backpacks,
flashing Europasses at the ticket collector.
The question then occurs to me whether it is worth paying a large
subsidy to a line on which hardly anyone regularly travels. The risk to
tourism cannot amount to much. The young things are on a quest for
unspoiled nature, at minimum cost. If they had no train they could and
would go by bus. We may be rightly worried about the old ladies. But if
we gave each of them a voucher for a personal taxi service, to take the
dearest possible option, I cannot imagine that the expenditure would
amount in total to more than the present subsidy.
This is not an argument against any subsidy for transport to faraway
places. On the contrary, nobody who visits a brisk, busy, prosperous
place like Orkney can fail to be impressed at how life even on the outer
islands is preserved. A lot of money goes in effect to white settlers,
yet some of it goes to real Orcadians, and I wish them well of it. But
it is the Orkney Islands Council that keeps down the cost of internal
services by ship and plane. The Scottish Office aids only the routes to
the mainland. When a remote authority throws subsidies about, we should
look closely at the wider effects, rather than blithely assume that all
subsidies are justified.
A hot topic on Orkney is the recent withdrawal of subsidy on freight
traffic to the mainland. Passenger subsidies are maintained, but only a
single company runs passenger services and it happens to be one of the
world's great shipping lines, P&amp;O. Yet P&amp;O carries freight as well. The
Orcadians fear that by using the subsidy to keep down its freight
tariffs too, it will drive out of business its four competitors, all
good examples of small, local enterprise. Once a monopoly is thus
established, P&amp;O will be tempted to exploit it and push its tariffs
right up again. The whole situation stands in marked contrast to that in
the Western Isles, where the Government continues to subsidise both
freight and passengers carried by the nationalised company, Caledonian
MacBrayne.
These fears seem to be well-founded, though I have not yet had time to
look into them. What they do point to is the lack of any coherent policy
on transport in the outlying regions of Scotland, or indeed in Scotland
generally. Without a coherent policy the Government, however good its
intentions, is vulnerable to the self-interested claims of commercial
interests. If Michael Forsyth and his new team want to put power into
the hands of the people, they should try to work out in some clearer
fashion who ought to get subsidies and on what grounds. A voucher system
for travelling and trading islanders, rather than cash for multinational
corporations, would be both bold and fair.

LOVE is surely the most cogent dramatic imperative; love in all its
hues -- which is essentially affection, passion, jealousy, violence,
pleasure, pain, and, of course, hate. This is a quintessential tale, a
perfect, poignant encapsulation of a love affair, informed by an insight
so sharp it pricks your skin, making you shudder with discomforting yet
strangely thrilling recognition.
The Shamens Theatre from Hungary's production is wordless but not
gagged. Liberated from words the company -- Eva Magyar, Csaba Horza'th,
and Kornel Horvath -- instantly form a more powerful language. Magyar
and Horza'th do so through perfectly timed gestures and the subtlest of
insinuations. Horvath does so through spirited percussion, providing not
so much musical accompaniment as a pulsating blood, veering from
syncopating salsa to dreamy ambient sounds to a hostile artillery which
assaulted the eardrums, while Magyar and Horza'th assaulted one another.
An abstract stylised narrative, choreographed by Magyar, The Tale
sketches out a lifetime's experiences in the course of 40 swift but
rapturous minutes. A couple, glistening with life and warmth, stranded
on a cold, bare stage, drift coyly towards one another. They clasp hands
and are bonded, betraying that initial slight bewilderment that this is
so, then exploring the joyous, erotic possibilities of such a union.
It's one soon soured by boredom and irritation; she becomes a burden, he
becomes a drag.
It's all evoked with quicksilver exactitude, from flirty fun through a
period of raging violence and mutual loathing, signalled by war paint,
to the compromised, dulled reconciliation of the aged, rubbing the paint
from their cheeks in a spirit of surrender yet glaring at each other
across a short space which has become a chasm.

''UH, ROBBIE? You see, huh?'' The little Italian cutie asked Wattie,
the photographer. She was standing just inside the entrance to T In The
Park, scanning the crowd, occasionally frowning but exuding the baffling
optimism of the dedicated fans. Hers was an eternally hopeful gaze, her
head rotating, her internal radar switched on, confident she would spot
her beloved visage among 30,000 sunburnt others.
She had travelled over from Italy to see Take That at Manchester
Arena, a trip arranged before Robbie Williams -- one of the Take That
quintet who wasn't the blond, fluffy one, or the stocky songwriting one,
but one of the three interchangeable others -- quit the band to pursue a
solo career unfettered by the killjoy restrictions which apply to a
teenybopper idol. Arriving in the UK, she had heard through the groupie
grapevine that Robbie was T'ing so had unhesitatingly headed north.
While Take That made their debut as a fearsome foursome in Manchester
she was stomping around Strathclyde Park in search of her prey,
determined to run him to ground. She was obviously a veteran at this
lark, making regular recces with the phalanx of photographers she knew
would be trying to track him down too. Every now and again she would
return from her sharp-eyed vigils and sidle up to the door of the press
enclosure, a one-woman intelligence mission. ''Robbie? You see?''
Inside the press area, a stringently guarded oasis of calm, us
somebodies were separated from you nobodies and were enjoying free food,
drinks, drugs, and frolics with the famous. Actually, despite the
desperately cool lime wristband passes and the aura of privilege
enveloping this inner sanctum, it was basically just a place for the
photographers to pack their stepladders, a piece of pitta bread and a
bit of tomato masquerading as a Greek salad cost #3.50, and there wasn't
a celeb in sight.
Some complimentary lager slips were being wafted around but none was
being wafted in my direction. I think you had to be a friend of a friend
of the woman who lived next door to a friend of a friend of a band to
get one. But, despite the complimentary lager slips, at least the queues
for the toilets were shorter. However, these toilets were
disconcertingly Europeanishly unisex -- how much did I want to freshen
up my lipstick at a mirror next to a urinal? Err, not much -- but they
did have toilet rolls. Out in the park, which resembled a desert, people
had nicked all the paper from the portaloos by the afternoon. In the
evening they attempted the obviously hopeless task of chucking them at
the stage from about a mile and a half away, causing mild stampedes as
everyone with the runs made a run for it, attempting to snatch shards of
tissue before the rolls hit the dust.
Meanwhile, the star spotting business proved infectious. Included in
the price of a ticket for a pop festival -- or the price of the 68 phone
calls you have to make to secure a so-called freebie if you're a
professional ligger -- is the promise of a high quotient of celebrities.
Not only on the stage but, possibly, in the audience. Maybe standing
next to you, their elbow in your ear. A Rolling Stones concert can
guarantee the presence of such major league famous people as Princess Di
and Mariella Frostrup (Jerry Hall doesn't count). T In The Park,
according to the rumours in the press zoo, boasted Chrissie Hynd and Joe
Strummer. That's B-list in anybody's book. ''Who's Joe Strummer? What
does he look like?'' ask the photographers, and went off to look for
Robbie.
I, hard bitten, cynical old hack that I am, had brought my titchy
Olympus Trip on a star-snapping quest, reasoning that if I could sneak
up on some pop person and set a mate a-clicking I could send the photie
into the Now You're Stalking section of loaded. Sad, I know, but I have
an excuse; I'm trying to compensate for a misspent youth, one wasted on
reading the entire oeuvre of Jane Austen and going to rosary instead of
doing the decent teenage thing and hitchhiking to London to camp outside
the house of Simon le Bon's mum. Well, we all make mistakes.
''What does Robbie look like?'' I asked.
Someone said, ''Well, he's got a torso, you know?''
I knew.
''And cropped blond hair.''
''Like Gazza?''
''Sort of.'' I gloomily reasoned that I wouldn't recognise Robbie
Williams if I tripped over him in a portaloo (and it was that kind of
festival). It was an insight that made me feel desperately old and
desperately depressed.
But not so depressed that I needed to seek solace at the Samaritans
stall, neatly positioned in between the Lost Property stall and the
Japanese Noodles stall. At one point I did wander past with curious
intent. Were they there to counsel people who had lost their house keys
or dropped their noodles (looking around there seemed to be a
proliferation of people who had no noodles to start with) or to offer
succour to star-starved fans, sobbing over an elusive Robbie?
The investigative journalist in me -- admittedly, not a significant
part of my DNA -- ventured forward to ask but then felt too intimidated
by the sombre young woman wearing a bright orange Samaritans badge who
was standing outside the tent. In the blazing heat she was draped in
layers of droopy black, looking like a, somewhat inappropriate, cross
between the Grim Reaper and the French Lieutenant's Woman.
I didn't snap any major stars. In fact, by the end of the weekend a
star of even a minor constellation would have been a major consolation;
I would have cheerily taken a pic of Shed Seven's roadie. Eventually I
was reduced to jumping up in the air and pointing the camera in roughly
the direction of the stage and M People's feet. Kylie did brush by me at
one stage but at waist level, out of my field of vision. Exactly how
small is Kylie? Let's just say a circus career will always be an option.
Wattie did get his man. He found Robbie revelling in his new-found
freedom, playing footie incognito amid the crowds. Someone once asserted
''a star is a person who works hard all his life to become well known
and then wears dark glasses to avoid being recognised''. Kylie had the
biggest, darkest glasses ever. Robbie, lad among lads, was glassless.
But he had reverted to natural brunette. I'd never have spotted him, but
I'd wager the Italian chick did.

Accidents can be avoided at sea, reports Stewart Fraser
GOSH, some mothers do have them. It's as well the Coastguard are on
hand to protect us, I'd say.
Someone can sign a cheque for #50,000 or more and get himself a boat.
Go off into the shipping lanes, and create havoc for miles around. No
driving licence. No test for fitness.
You see speeding boats cut across the bows of smaller craft, utterly
careless of any consequences, and wonder at the mentality of some
owners. You see sailing boats careering towards one another, and neither
has a clue which one has right of way.
You even see a few benighted boaters trying to argue with the police
boat crew that they should have precedence over nuclear submarines. Now,
that's really silly.
Yet the vast majority of people who go boating take a sensible and
serious view of the paramount need for safety. And it is worth
reassuring families coming to boating for the first time that only a
small percentage of people, certainly in Scottish waters, are marinised
morons.
And it's just as comforting to realise that everyone -- newcomers
certainly included -- has trained people looking out for them.
Visiting Coastguard personnel at their Greenock HQ last week, I was
fascinated to see the amount of modern electronic equipment at hand.
Regional Controller Paul Lane, dealing with the West of Scotland and
Northern Ireland, pointed out that their equipment is very powerful
indeed.
''We can pick up a message from 3300 miles away,'' and added, ''just
as well we are listening.''
That's the point: they were, and are listening 24 hours a day, all
year round. In the Clyde area this year, they have been involved in
co-ordinating the rescues of 350 people in 256 incidents.
It's not surprising that Safety at Sea is the title of a new
publication being actively promoted by half-a-dozen official agencies.
There is backing by the Coastguard, RNLI, Royal Yachting Association,
Royal Life Saving Society, Marine Safety Agency, and British Marine
Industries Federation.
These safety booklets are free, available from the agencies, many
chandlers and dealers, and contain excellent advice for all who go to
sea.
''You can never take the sea for granted,'' adds Greg Albrighton,
Clyde District staff officer at Greenock. ''You have to use your common
sense.
''Make sure your boat is seaworthy and you know how to use it
properly. Take all the equipment you may need, like flares and life
jackets. Know how to use your VHF radio.
''Get proper training, with an RYA-backed course. Check the weather,
the tides, the engine. Think safety. No-one can legislate to stop things
happening, but common sense can avoid the worst results.''
With 10,000 incidents recorded throughout the UK last year, involving
around 17,500 people, it's little wonder Coastguard personnel take a
hard-headed view of the need for safety at all times.
But they emphasise they want people to be able to enjoy their time at
sea. A bit of thought -- that's all it needs.
''Like the Yacht and Boat Safety Scheme,'' says Greg. ''Ask people to
use that, and it'll make life a lot easier, for everyone.
''You get a copy, at the back of the new safety booklet. Fill in your
details. The card is valid for three years. Then post it or drop it in
to the Coastguard, or anyone using the scheme.
''You'll see a separate part to leave with someone ashore when you go
sailing. If they get worried for any reason, they tell us, we have your
details and can check out the situation.''
As the Coastguard points out, accidents can be avoided. Why become a
statistic, when you could be enjoying yourself instead.

WHITBREAD has exceeded market hopes and is buying David Lloyd Leisure
for 400p a share cash to value the fast growing tennis and fitness group
at #201m.
Founder and former Davis Cup tennis player David Lloyd himself will
end up with about #20m, before tax, including the value of his options.
He has driven a hard bargain but Whitbread chief executive Peter
Jarvis said that this was an opportunity for which he was prepared ''to
pay top dollar''.
The retailing and brewing group had been in talks for about a month
and soon agreed a price. The deal comes just 24 hours after Whitbread
said it was buying the 16 Marriott branded hotels in the UK from Scott's
Hospitality of Canada for #180m.
The effect on earnings will be broadly neutral this year and there
should be a contribution thereafter.
Mr Jarvis added that in 10 years' time, health and fitness could be
contributing as much as brewing -- thus possibly indicating that he is
not too interested in buying Carlsberg-Tetley from Allied Domecq.
David Lloyd Leisure was founded in 1980 and was floated on the stock
market two years ago at 150p per share. It has 16 leisure clubs
including Renfrew which is the most profitable.
The David Lloyd Trusts have irrevocably accepted the offer and,
crucially, Mr Lloyd is staying on as chairman.
With the Whitbread financial resources behind him, he will be able to
expand the business much more quickly.

Ross Finlay goes by motorway to Northampton with the latest Scorpio
AS the weeks go by, with more examples appearing on the road, the new
Ford Scorpio still provokes mixed reactions. One of my colleagues,
sitting in a parked Scorpio in a Glasgow street, actually felt menaced
by the looks and gestures of a bunch of mini-hooligans gathered round.
But when, after picking up the Scorpio Ultima described here, I called
in at a roadside lunch stop, two waitresses were so impressed by the car
that I asked them over to have a look around it -- while pointing out
that my wife would be one of the party too.
Although it went on sale in January of this year, the latest Scorpio
was given a first showing in September 1994. It is a development -- and
much more than just a face-lift -- of the previous model, with
substantially modified engines in the top-ranked versions, which also
come with every piece of equipment Ford can throw at them short of
putting on stratospheric prices, and class-obliterating passenger space.
As its name suggests, the Ultima is the last word in Scorpios,
especially when fitted, like the test car, with the latest 24-valve
version of the 2.9-litre V6 engine, tuned and assembled by Cosworth.
This gives it a peak power output of 210bhp, and strong torque. It is
worth pointing out that this #26,930 executive saloon, the roomiest car
in its class and no kind of lightweight, with automatic transmission as
standard, will reach 60mph in nine seconds, provide astonishingly good
kick-down overtaking power, and touch a test track maximum close to
140mph.
It is usually assumed that buyers of this kind of car -- most often a
company buy -- are not all that interested in the nitty-gritty of fuel
consumption figures. However, during several days' use, of which the
major element was a motorway cruise to Northampton and back, the test
car showed a running average of 28mpg on its trip computer.
That was the kind of journey in which the Scorpio was in its element,
even if there were only a few occasions when it was appropriate to let
Cosworth's V6 rev really hard. In the executive class, motorway manners
count for a lot. Here, the Ultima was quiet and composed, showing no
more than 2500rpm at an indicated 70mph in top, with only occasional use
made of the cruise control which is just one feature of the lavish
equipment specification. The colleague with whom I shared the wheel
reckons that cruise control makes for lazy and unresponsive drivers, and
he may be right.
Other items in the Ultima specification include supportive
leather-upholstered seats, with a full range of electrically operated
adjustments plus a memory; sport, economy and winter settings for the
automatic transmission, complete with wheelspin control; heated front
seats, twin front airbags, a comprehensive security system,
pollen-filtered ventilation, electronic anti-lock brakes, air
conditioning and a self-dipping rear view mirror which reacts to the
amount of light from following vehicles focused on it.
Although there was one annoyance in the passenger cabin -- a
''chitter'' as the leather inside edge of the driver's seat graunched
constantly against the central console -- there is no doubt that this is
the roomiest car in its category, as well as being comfortable on a long
journey. Rear seat space is unusually generous, although the Scorpio's
rear-wheel drive layout means that the boot, while being wide and long,
is quite shallow.
The Ultima is not meant to be a sports saloon, and with its long
wheelbase and general bulkiness it hardly enjoys being thrown around
twisting roads. Its general ride quality is not the best in the class,
thanks to the modified but still essentially 1980s suspension design.
But for space, comfort, easy running, straight line performance and
maximum equipment levels it scores highly among its executive rivals,
even if it is a car I would still rather be inside, looking out of, than
outside, puzzling about its external lines.

THE Microsoft company is a phenomenon of the computer age. It has made
its chairman and founder, Bill Gates, the richest man in America and his
company one of the biggest in the world in the space of 20 years. Last
year its revenues were $4.65 billion worldwide.
Founded in 1975 by the 17-year-old computer prodigy, the company has
had one aim since its inception, to put a computer in every home and on
every desk. That goal is steadily approaching reality. The company's
rise is the stuff of modern legend.
Gates's company developed the MS-Dos, the disk-operating system to
enable IBM and compatible machines to operate without every instruction
being separately programmed, a system which coined the phrase ''user
friendly''.
Now Microsoft designs, develops, markets, and supports a wide range of
personal computer software systems, applications, development tools and
languages plus hardware, peripherals and books. Each product, they say,
is designed simply to make it easier for everyone to take advantage of
the full power of personal computing.
As the technology has compacted and accelerated, programming has
improved exponentially to enable people just to use the machines.
Microsoft has an enormous hold on the market. Its products are
available for all popular computer makes. The MS-Dos system, introduced
in 1981 is now installed on 120 million IBM and compatible PCs and is
the world's most successful software program to date. In 1983 the firm
developed Windows, a graphical system which made computers not quite,
but near enough idiot-proof.
The company says its Windows can be seen on more than 50 million
computers and rightly claims that it is the standard operating system
for PCs. The phenomenon contributes to a vast industry around the globe.
At the moment 3700 independent software vending companies are offering
more than 8000 Windows-based applications.
The company has a huge support system which includes authorised
technical support centres, independent training organisations which
offer hands-on courses to computer professionals and consulting
services.
Microsoft Press provides new users with their first source of
user-friendly guides to the system, latter day Bibles for the converted.
Such is the volume of business that many of these titles have become
award-winning best-sellers and are available in 30 languages.
In the world of today's fast-moving technology, if you see it on
screen, the chances are you see it through Windows.
And after the company's launch later this month you will probably see
it through Windows 95.
Ease of use will be improved with Windows 95 through the Plug and Play
architecture and a more ''intuitive'' user interface. It will be a
complete, integrated 32-bit operating system that does not require
MS-DOS, and it includes a dial-up network access services. The system
will be compatible with applications and device drivers for both MS-DOS
and Windows.
Windows 95 will run on Intel (or compatible) 80386DX or higher
processors with a minimum of 4MB of memory (8MB recommended). A
VGA-compatible video adapter is also required. The system will need up
to 15MB additional hard-disk space as a typical upgrade from Windows 3.
The system is basically designed to make mainstream PCs easier and
more powerful. Its new user interface was designed in Windows 95 that
will help make computing even easier for both novices and experienced
users who want greater efficiency and flexibility.
Three advantages being touted are the Long File Name utility which
allows operators to give their files identity tags of up to 250
characters instead of the present eight which leads to confusion and
unpronounceable coding. Plug and Play will make hardware set-up
automatic, and built-in networking will make connecting to an existing
network much simpler.
Microsoft says that users want to run more than one application or
task at the same time, accessing files, electronic mail, and
public-information networks from any location at work, at home, or on
the road. They also want better multi-media, whether for playing MS-DOS
based games or for teleconferencing using TV-quality video resolution.
Microsoft also estimates that migration costs to the new generation of
Windows can be recouped in three to six months.
The Plug-and-Play technology has been jointly developed by PC
manufacturers to dramatically improve the integration of PC hardware and
software. It is built into all levels of Windows 95 and covers both
common desktop and laptop devices, such as monitors, printers, video
cards, sound cards, CD-ROM drives, SCSI adapters, modems, and PCMCIA
devices.
With Windows 95, a user can easily install or connect Plug and Play
devices to the system, letting the system automatically allocate
hardware resources. For example, by simply plugging in a CD-ROM and
sound card, a desktop PC can be turned into a multi-media playback
system. The user simply plugs in the components, turns on the PC, and
''plays'' a video clip.

A VISIT to the Traverse -- all right, to the very agreeable Traverse
bar -- suggests that the raffish, bohemian spirit of the old, much-loved
(for reasons never adequately explained) Grassmarket theatrical coup
survives in new premises.
Like most other arts organisations in these straitened times, the
theatre is availing itself of any means to raise a bob or two. To this
end it runs a ''Sponsor a Seat'' scheme by which, for a mere #75 a year,
you can purchase a little engraved nameplate for your favourite pew, and
most people -- not least thesps of the calibre of the Julies Christie
and Walters -- are content with that. The Traverse being the Traverse,
however, others are a shade more playful.
Thus, if you're lucky, you could find yourself occupying a seat
bearing the encouraging legend ''Good Luck from the Auditors''. Equally,
you might just be met by the rather sweet, albeit anonymous, message,
''Hoping This Fits Your Bottom Snugly''.
We await with interest any news of a rush to book the bench that
declares, unambiguously, ''This is a No-Farting Zone''. At #75, it isn't
the cheapest joke we've come across.
Rice little earner
WHAT WITH the unusual meteorological activity we're having (Diary
prediction: heavens open before the Edinburgh Tattoo's lone piper
finishes his last blaw) the Royal Mile has come increasingly to resemble
an oriental souk, stalls laden with traditional ethnic Scottish hippy
tat, crazed Fringe mummers thrusting flyers into your every orifice and,
of course, more buskers than you could shake a lead-weighted baton at.
Given the indisputable fact that the capital just oozes class, it was
therefore no real surprise to see a new addition to the musicians' ranks
the other day when one woman produced a harp. Not just any little harp,
you understand, but a full-size concert job on which the lady -- right
there on the pavement, Euphemia -- proceeded to batter out (or whatever
it is one does with a harp) favourite themes from the movies while
collecting what looked very like a living wage from the punters.
All of this distracted attention somewhat from a nearby stall offering
handmade necklaces. Again, not just any old necklaces but -- and who
could resist? -- ornamental wares promising ''Your Name Engraved on a
Grain of Rice''. The Diary thought of offering to pay with a peanut
engraved with the likeness of a fiver but that might have seemed
churlish.
Nevertheless, we hope to be on the spot for a full report when that
well-known German tourist, Herr Johannes Wolfgang Amadeus Von
Panzerwagennachbildung am Rhein, turns up to order his full decorative
paella.
That nation again
STILL with the Festival City, our thanks to the Guardian for sorting
out a long-standing misunderstanding at a stroke in its ''Edinburgh
1995'' guide.
''There's nothing worse,'' it states, ''than feeling left out, knowing
that somewhere else everyone is having a good time. Such is the feeling
engendered even among pampered Londoners when the cultural focus of the
nation moves to Edinburgh.''
Yes indeed. By all means come to Edinburgh and explain all about 'the
nation'' and its cultural focus.
Show stopper
SPEAKING of the weather -- and who isn't? -- unconfirmed reports point
to freak outbreaks of heavy sunshine even in darkest Galloway. According
to the local Gazette, this made conditions difficult at the recent 184th
Wigtown Show.
As the paper reported, getting its priorities right: ''When judging
began, few could have suspected that within a couple of hours the
temperatures would become so extreme that the sheep would be allowed to
leave the site early.''
Several bachelor farmers were later being treated for shock.
BA takes the biscuit
FOR our part, we made a little time amid the atrociously fine weather
over the last fortnight to test the strength (weaker than a Jeffrey
Archer plot) of the pound sterling among our European partners. Thus it
was that we found ourselves jet-setting of a recent morning just in time
to catch elevenses on the BA shuttle to beautiful Heathrow.
A nice spread, as they say, with dinky little sandwiches and all.
But is BA trying to spoil the sophisticated, hard-working business
executives who ply its route? For what was dessert if not an authentic
Tunnock's Caramel Wafer? Who could ask for more? Actually the
nine-year-old with whom we travelled could. Thus it was that he became
the satisfied consumer of several bars that other, less discerning
travellers unaccountably failed to scoff. Some people don't know when
they're well off.
Obsession
OUR political adviser writes: Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, health
minister, might be advised to temper his support for Stephen Dorrell's
plans to oblige doctors, on pain of disciplinary action, to blow the
whistle on incompetent colleagues. Someone might suggest applying the
same principle to the occupants of the Scottish Office. Or is 11% in the
latest System Three poll safely above the quality threshold for Scottish
Conservatism?
A disgruntled Edinburgh trade unionist writes to the worthy-but-dull
New Statesman to complain about that journal's treatment of the
stout-hearted Socialist Workers Party and to point out that the issues
the SWP raises ''will not go away''.
For example, he adds of working life in the cooncil, ''I will still
face the 'rigours of the market', in the form of compulsive competitive
tendering, whether or not Labour is elected.''
So now we know: Tory local government policies really are a
psychiatric condition.
Ultimate jaunt
AN Edinburgh newspaper -- let's call it the Scotsman -- has just
unveiled a thrilling travel offer, nothing less, indeed, than ''the
ultimate experience'' of a trip through the Eurotunnel and a jaunt round
a Calais hypermarket.
Don't all rush at once.
Exploiting the possibilities of modern high-speed rail travel to the
full, this ''fabulous opportunity'' involves a flight to Heathrow and a
bus trip to Folkestone.
Trains: who needs them?
Religious clash
YOU probably don't need to know this, but somehow it's not information
we can bear to keep to ourselves. According to the Los Angeles Times
there are now 16 people named Jesus Christ in possession of Californian
driving licences. God alone knows what happens when one messiah bends
the bumper of another.

APREVIEW of the Windows 95 program shows that it does, indeed, have
advantages, particularly for the beginner. One nice touch is the fact
that disabled users have been considered. It has the processing
equivalent of ramps and hearing aids.
Users will find many programs like Word are basically the same, but
faster and they've been tweaked to make them easier to use then before.
On switching on and booting up, the hard drive can be accessed directly
without creating fiddly icons for every program.
Files can be accessed without opening file manager, the directory
management program which has now been built into the system so Windows
does the managing. Fewer keystrokes means less hassle.
The program manager of the old Windows is now called the Taskbar and
is much more user-friendly. It can be located anywhere on the screen
again for ease of access, operation, and comprehension.
One handy feature is the desktop icon which loads regularly and
frequently-accessed programs into a single area for instant access. A
recycle bin puts deleted files into storage so they can be recalled
immediately, allowing dead files to be reincarnated and salvaged.
A new search system allows fines to be located by name, date, or even
by a portion of the text within a file.
In Word, the word-processing system which is running inside Windows,
one major benefit is the Long Name filesaver which makes them much more
recognisable then the previous eight characters. Word itself has been
smoothed and offers a ''look for favourites'' mode which will bring up
favourite or well-used files from a vertical toolbar. File names can
also be changed from the screen without having to get into file manager
first.
Other Word improvements include easy to understand graphic icons for
printing, an auto-correct spellchecker, which works in the background
and gives a visible indication of words the system does not recognise
which makes it quick and easy to alter errors as they arise. The
dictionary is bigger and the thesaurus has obviously been updated too.
For writers it has a highlight facility which will make identified text
stand out more visibly.
Networking and fax operation is more integrated, much simpler now to
operate, allowing faxing direct from screen.
As mentioned, the Accessibility Properties will prove a boon to some
disabled users. A Filterkeys function is installed to ignore brief or
repeated keystrokes or slow the repeat rate. For the hard of hearing, a
sound will give a visual warning if a background program has created a
sound. It will also give a visual caption for a sampled vocal warning.
There is an excellent High Contrast mode for people with vision
impairment. People who can't hold a mouse can move the cursor with the
keys.
The system is a lot easier for a beginner to use, as it recognises new
hardware and asks only for a point and click on the add-new-hardware
icon. But it seems more difficult for experts than for beginners because
it is more complex and that's because the actual programing is huge by
any standards.
It is more forgiving. If a program does crash, a fail-safe kicks in so
the chances of losing information seem negligible.
The really good news from Windows is that it runs games superbly. The
program handles memory more efficiently and makes more memory available
for use. In previous systems the limit was about 640k. Now Windows 95
loads small programs into different areas, freeing up base memory, thus
allowing games to run at high speed and use their full potential.
Business operators may not appreciate that, but the swelling ranks of
home users will just love it.
* Windows 95 system tested on a Twinhead Slimnote 5100c laptop with
20Meg memory and 514M hard drive.

LEADING trade unions are divided on whether to go along with Labour's
plans to revise the sponsorship system, with the Amalgamated Engineering
and Electrical Union the most eager to retain existing arrangements and
the Manufacturing Science and Finance Union already implementing what
Labour is proposing.
Between these two views there are varying shades of opinion, although
it appears clear that the two most influential trade unions, the
Transport and General Workers' Union and Unison, will demand a major say
in where their sponsorship money goes.
The TGWU currently sponsors 39 MPs including Labour leader Tony Blair
and Gordon Brown, Harriet Harman and Gavin Strang from the Shadow
Cabinet as well as Scottish MPs Maria Fyfe, George Galloway, Adam
Ingram, David Marshall, John Reid, and James Wray. Unison sponsors 20,
including David Blunkett, Michael Meacher, Mo Mowlem, Clare Short, Henry
McLeish and Rachel Squire.
These two unions, which have been the most critical of Labour's
''modernising'' programme, will not be keen to lose control of their
sponsorship money, and there are signs that they might prefer to put it
to other uses rather than see it allocated to support prospective MPs in
marginal constituencies who might be less than sympathetic to the
unions.
Although a relatively small part of the financial support that unions
give to Labour -- less than #1000 per sponsored MP per year out of a
total of #2m in the case of the TGWU -- the sponsorship money is seen as
important in assisting with the constituency costs of MPs they know to
be sympathetic.
The General Municipal and Boilermakers, which numbers George
Robertson, John Cunningham and Tom Clarke among its 20 sponsored MPs, is
''happy '' to go along with Labour's proposals which echo the findings
of its own internal review.
The AEEU, which has 18 sponsored MPs including Kevin Barron, Bob
Hughes, Jimmy Dunnachie, Willie McKelvey and Michael Martin, emphasises
the importance of retaining the present system.
Acting general secretary Ken Jackson declared that the union had a
firm line that it wanted to keep its sponsored MPs. ''If Mr Blair is
distancing himself from the unions, that is all the more reason why we
need our representation in Parliament,'' he added.

jumpers or 6ft 5in and 20 stone of fast and fearless rugby winger. It
does now. In drug-riddled, shamateurist sport of all sorts from the
simplest head-to-head race to the equipment-dependent cycling, ski-ing
or horse-racing events to multinational team-game tournaments, the
income-led demands of sponsors and television companies have set the
agenda. Never has it been so difficult for individual athletes to
establish their personal priorities.
Presumably as a result, committed Christians are now talking more
publicly about their principles. Among the international athletics
circus, they are known as the God Squad and they are recruiting new
members steadily. Many of them are evangelistic about their faith.
Chief among them now is the new triple-jump world record-holder,
29-year-old Jonathan Edwards. The physics graduate and research
geneticist sprinkles his conversation with Biblical quotations and
paraphrases, but unlike more recent converts to religion, appears to
enjoy discussions about his faith.
The day after he became the first man in the record books to exceed 18
metres in the hop, skip and jump, he was talking seriously of preparing
to enjoy his new-found status and any financial rewards it might bring
him without yielding to temptation.
''No, I am not the perfect person . . . I enjoy a glass of wine. It
says in the Psalms that God gives wine which makes the heart glad.
''I go to a Baptist church, and my father's an Anglican minister. But
I'm not specific to any denomination. I look at the way my life has
gone, and I'm amazed I've done certain things, knowing my character.
Ultimately, I say I'm here by God's grace and by His design,'' he said
yesterday.
He was not always quite so sanguine. Two years ago in Toronto for the
World Indoor Athletic Championships, he said: ''I think I can jump as
far as anybody without taking drugs. I believe God gives me my strength
-- people might say that is a drug.''
He rejected selection for the 1991 World championships, because it
would have meant competing on the Sabbath. His subsequent change of mind
-- the result of a friend's dream, which he believes to have been part
of a divine call to him to be a sporting ambassador for the Christian
religion -- was received with dismay by his parents, who had ''hauled
him home'' from friends' houses when he sneaked off to watch forbidden
television on Sundays.
For all the metaphors of physical ferocity applied to Jonah Lomu, the
New Zealand winger during the rugby World Cup in South Africa, the
descriptions of the 20-year-old Tongan bank clerk vie with each other
for mildness: shy, devout and God-loving. Unlike his team-mate, Michael
Jones, Lomu's convictions do not prevent him playing on Sundays.
They are part of a growing cluster of top-ranking players in many
sports who are born-again Christians: golf, football, tennis and cricket
all have their evangelical Christians, while boxing is still associated
with evangelical Muslims.
Along with the New Zealand All-Blacks, rugby boasts Chester Williams,
the only black member of the South African squad, who prays and reads
the Bible every day.
Best-known publicly-professing Christian in Scottish football
currently is the Aberdeen and Scotland defender, Brian Irvine, who took
part in a recent Billy Graham crusade at the Pittodrie stadium. After
the public announcement that he had been diagnosed as suffering from
multiple sclerosis, he said: ''I am so grateful for my faith in the
living God at this time.''
English football has regular Bible study meetings for London-based
players led by Alan Comfort, the former Middlesborough winger who is now
a vicar in Essex.
Among the few women who make a point of professing their beliefs is
Scots golfer Jane Connachan. The former Curtis Cup player is assistant
pro at Gullane and a coach to the Ladies Golfing Association. German
golfer Bernhard Langer, after a Christian experience on the American
circuit, regularly leads Bible studies on the international circuit.
When Kriss Akabusi found God in 1987 many predicted he would lose the
aggression that fuels winning performances. He claimed that it gave him
an added edge. ''I began to believe that my talent was God-given, and
this was my ministry. That gave me aggression and enthusiasm to do the
best I could,'' he said. The effect began to attract other athletes to
the idea of prayer, to be told by Akabusi: ''It doesn't work like
that.''
Christians in Sport, an evangelical organisation which began in
America and has been increasingly active in the UK (mainly in England)
for about 15 years, has strong links with athletics and usually sends a
lay preacher chaplain with the UK team to international events.
Its spokeswoman, Helen Nunn, said they had a mailing list of 8000
supporters in the UK including a number of top names. Edwards and
Akabusi are known to be among them along with sprinter Phyllis Smith and
1500m runner Tony Morrell.
An Oxford vicar, the Rev. Bruce Gillingham, is chaplain to the
European Golf Tour and recently had a group of nine top-ranking golfers
attending meetings at the Open. Funded by donations, they are
increasingly using sport as a method of involving people of all ages in
church activities.
A jaded public is largely behind them. Since Eric Liddell's
record-breaking 400m final at the Paris Olympics in 1924 after pulling
out of the 100m final because it was to be run on a Sunday, there has
always been an extra heart-busting pride in sportsmen of high principle.

THE final chapter of a ''jinx'' trial that was dogged by misfortune
was written yesterday when a company director, jailed for two years on
fraud charges, was freed on appeal.
The Court of Criminal Appeal ruled that Gordon MacDonald had suffered
a miscarriage of justice because of a series of mistakes by the trial
sheriff.
Mr MacDonald, 43, was convicted at Glasgow Sheriff Court last August
after a seven-month trial that cost an estimated #500,000 following a
four-year investigation by British Transport Police and the
procurator-fiscal.
By the end of the case, three jurors had been dismissed for submitting
false expense claims, reducing the jury to the legal minimum of 12.
Another caught chickenpox and the remainder were sent home for eight
days to avoid the risk of the trial having to be aborted.
There was a further delay when Sheriff Graham Johnston contracted food
poisoning and family bereavements among the jurors and holidays caused
more hold-ups.
Mr MacDonald, of The Wynd, Dalgety Bay, Fife, was charged with
defrauding ScotRail over the repair and service of mechanical and
hydraulic jacks while a director of Trak Services of Cambuslang.
His counsel, Miss Rita Rae, argued before Lord Ross, the Lord Justice
Clerk, sitting with Lords Morison and Johnston, that her client had
suffered a miscarriage of justice because of a number of misdirections
to the jury by Sheriff Johnston.
First, she alleged that the sheriff had failed properly to direct the
jury on the definition of the crime of fraud and what was required to
prove it. She said the sheriff had also wrongly told the jury that the
crime was one of conspiracy.
Lord Ross said the appeal court agreed the sheriff's directions on
this aspect of the case were ''wholly inadequate''.
In his report to the appeal court, Sheriff Johnston said he could
offer no explanation for his reference to the crime being a conspiracy.
Miss Rae also argued that the sheriff had failed to give adequate
direction to the jury. In his report to the appeal court, Sheriff
Johnston conceded: ''I am not sure even now I understand what the
defence case was.''
Lord Ross said: ''If the sheriff did not understand what the defence
case was, it would be surprising if he was able to give the jury
adequate directions about it.''
The judges also ruled that Sheriff Johnston had misdirected the jury
about the meaning of the not proven verdict.
The court was also satisfied that the sheriff was guilty of a
''serious misdirection'' in his definition of what amounted to
reasonable doubt.
The judges set aside the jury's guilty verdict and quashed the
conviction.
Mr McDonald did not apply for interim liberation pending his appeal
and was due to be released later this week after serving half of his
two-year sentence.

POLICE and wildlife conservationists have mounted a major operation to
catch hunters who have shot protected peregrine falcons at two sites in
Ayrshire.
The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds says it is sickened by
the attacks on the birds of prey and has described the shootings as
''deplorable''. If caught and prosecuted, those responsible could face
fines of up to #5000.
The society's investigators said yesterday that three peregrines had
been killed and chicks stolen in two separate incidents in June, one at
a nest site near New Cumnock and another near Kilbirnie.
RSPB investigators and a specialist police team have kept their
inquiries secret until now in the hope of uncovering information that
would lead to the arrests of those responsible.
The latest persecution of peregrines follows five separate incidents
in which nests were robbed in Ayrshire.
There are only 1100 breeding pairs in the UK, 200 of which are found
in south-west Scotland. The birds are protected by law. The RSPB says
they are killed illegally by gamekeepers out to protect grouse shooting.
Nest robbers can make big money from the Arab and German falconry
trade, where young wild birds are highly prized.

RUTH WISHART finds that choice has become a keyword for women living
and working in the nineties
ASTRANGE, hybrid creature, this Ms Britain who inhabits the final few
years of the twentieth century. In some senses enjoying freedoms of
which her grandmother barely dreamed; the ability to control her
fertility, to explore her sexuality, to discover her potential in
spheres of employment which were once so firmly an all-male preserve
that ladies loos did not require to feature on floor plans.
In general terms she may look forward to a longer, healthier lifestyle
with every decade that passes. She enjoys more choices about her
partner, about whether or not she will plump for cohabitation rather
than marriage, about when and even if she will have children.
For among the most fascinating statistics to emerge from this new
Social Focus on Women, is the fact that women are now more likely to
have a first child in their early thirties than their early twenties
and, even more startlingly, that more than a fifth of women born in the
late sixties will still be childless by the time they are 40.
As the advert has it: you've come a long way baby. And in making few
direct gender comparisons with the lot of the modern male, unlike the
most recent Equal Opportunities Commission report on inequalities, this
new report comes at the rather different but equally valid angle of
examining women's progress against a backdrop of former female
lifestyles.
Having said that, women should pause a while before bringing out the
bunting. Because buried within the heady mass of research from surveys,
censuses, and the Government's own departmental statistics are some
unpalatable truths about today's women which seem to have bucked the
progressive trend.
Given that, for most women, many choices are predicated on economic
independence for instance, it's dispiriting to learn that in 62% of
households men still earn more, and in only 25% is there parity. Three
quarters of men earn more than #230 per week for instance as against
half of women.
Now some of that is due to the large numbers of women who work
part-time. And, in fairness, it seems that 80% of women have made a
definite choice about working shorter hours perhaps because their
domestic demands make a flexible working day a necessity.
But dig a little deeper and you find that we have hardly moved at all
from the situation where those professions dominated by women,
especially health and education, also show a dearth of that sex at
managerial level. We have our hands on more jobs, girls, but not many
more levers of power.
How can it be for instance, to take one of the few areas with separate
Scottish research, that 95% of nursery and primary school staff is
female, but two thirds of the heads and deputy heads are male? Where are
they finding all these promotable men? Yet there are also trends which
suggest that even if women still aren't punching at the financial weight
their education and talent would suggest, they are more and more likely
to take some control over what resources they do have.
Three quarters of all women now use some form of plastic credit, eight
out of 10 have a bank account and two thirds have one with a building
society. In fact 17% of mortgages are now held by women alone in their
own name.
Back at the happy homestead, however, changes are less discernible. Do
not be fooled by pavements bursting with young New Men with babies
strapped papoose-style to their manly bosoms. Damn few of them are
within sight of the cooker at feeding time, few are conversant with the
purposes of an ironing board, and the contents of bottles of floor
cleanser remain something of a mystery to them.
In the category of smaller mercies we should perhaps intone some mild
gratitude for 11% more men washing dishes in the past decade, and four
out of 10 of them acknowledging that a sick child was a two-parent
problem. Marriage itself has undergone a sea of change, of course. Lone
mothers have trebled since the early seventies, marriages were down by a
quarter in the same period and divorces doubled. If Ms Britain doesn't
like her bed she's less likely to stay lying in it.
And in fact the trend with people born from the sixties-on is to view
cohabitation as all part of life's natural sexual tapestry whether or
not these experimental relationships ever end in marriage.
A corollary of all of which is that women also see their lifestyle and
leisure in a different light. The television soap operas are still
attracting massive female audiences, but there's demonstrably less
knitting and needlework going on the while. And DIY or aerobics followed
by a glass with the girls is much more part of the modern pattern.
The downside of these changes comes in health statistics with young
women in particular persisting with junk food and smoking. The latter
habit has given women one very unenviable piece of parity: they're now
as likely as men to contract lung cancer.
Looking at the whole package, it's significant that the most
formidable strides have been made in areas like fertility control which
are not dependent on the laws of the land for progress, nor indeed on
the overwhelmingly male dominated power structure.
Gosh, we've now got one in 10 female MPs compared with less than 4%
cent 10 years ago, notes the report with barely concealed admiration for
this great leap forward.
Could do better, I fear. Could do better than just a quarter of all
local councillors.
Will do better, Deo Volente, when a Parliament built for the modern
age is under way in Edinburgh.
In the meantime, it is mesmerising to learn that of those classic
books written by women, the one most borrowed is Peter Rabbit. Then
again, perhaps they're being taken out by women for their husbands.

<HEADLINE>Anger at release of 'Little Red Riding Hood' killer</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>976978038</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE release of child-killer Michael Ireland -- jailed for life after
the 1976 ''Little Red Hiding Hood'' case -- has provoked an angry
reaction.
Ireland tied up, sexually abused, and battered to death 10-year-old
Susan Giles after ensnaring the little girl, dressed as the nursery
rhyme character, on her way to a friend's birthday party.
Her body, covered in bite marks, was found by her distraught parents
after Ireland tried to set her ablaze in a Northampton garage.
The Prison Service confirmed that Ireland, now 42, had been freed
after his case was considered by a parole board panel.
Ms Mary Williams, 64, who owned the garage in which Susan's body was
found, said: ''Life should mean life. Now he is walking around again I
wonder if my grandchildren are safe. It makes me shudder . . . he's
evil.''
The Giles's elder daughter Wendy, 32, said her parents had been left
scarred by the ordeal.
''They have never talked about their ordeal. It is too painful. We
know Ireland has been released but that is all I want to say,'' she
said.
The judge at Ireland's trial, Mr Justice Forbes, described the case as
''the most horrible I have ever encountered'' after the court accepted a
plea of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility.
Ireland served most of his sentence at Grendon Jail, near Aylesbury,
Buckinghamsire. His current whereabouts are unknown.
A Prison Service spokesman could not confirm a report that Ireland's
release happened last October.
However, he stressed that Home Secretary Michael Howard had no say on
the release, as the killer had been jailed for manslaughter rather than
murder.
''In such circumstances, a prisoner can be released only if the parole
board is satisfied that he or she is no longer a threat to the public,''
he added.
''If the parole board reaches that conclusion, the law says that a
prisoner must be released.''
Sir Ivan Lawrence, chairman of the all-party Home Affairs committee,
said yesterday that it was a ''matter of concern'' that someone like
Ireland should be walking the streets.
Most people would feel that in the circumstances of a case like his,
the killer should have to serve life, said Sir Ivan.
''On the one hand, manslaughter cannot be assumed to be as serious as
murder. On the other hand, most people would assume that someone who
commits offences in these circumstances, sentenced to life, should have
to serve life.
''This issue must be resolved. Most people would think that it should
be resolved more harshly rather than more leniently.''
Sir Ivan's committee is currently considering whether the mandatory
life sentence for murder should be abolished in favour of allowing
judges discretion to set a fixed sentence. Several penal reform groups
and leading figures in the legal establishment have backed abolition of
automatic life sentences.
Sir Ivan stressed that the committee had yet to form a position on the
abolition issue.

THE famous sculpture of the Three Graces by Antonio Canova was
exhibited in Edinburgh yesterday, the culmination of a long campaign to
bring it north of the Border.
Centre stage at the opening at The National Gallery of Scotland was
curator Timothy Clifford, who has been painted as both saint and sinner
in the saga to secure the statue for the nation.
Yesterday, Mr Clifford was up-beat and excited about the Three Graces,
which will be the centrepiece of an exhibition at the National Gallery
on The Mound.
He described its arrival in the capital as one of the highlights of
his arts career.
However, he remained non-committal when asked about his gaffe
involving US billionaire John Paul Getty II which nearly scuppered last
year's attempt to keep the sculpture in Britain.
The famous statue was secured for the country only thanks to a #1m
donation from the US billionaire. His intervention helped the National
Galleries of Scotland and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London to
raise the #7.6m required to beat off a rival bid from the Getty Museum
in Malibu.
However, Mr Getty II threatened to withdraw his financial offer when
Mr Clifford suggested on radio that a family feud between Mr Getty II
and his father, founder of the Getty Museum, was behind his offer.
Only after an abject public apology by Mr Clifford did Mr Getty agree
to donate the #1m.
When Mr Clifford was asked whether he felt he had blown it at the time
because of the comments he made, he said: ''Yes, maybe.''
However, he said he ''slept soundly in his bed'' and believed he had
made his peace with Mr Getty. He added he hoped Mr Getty would come and
see the exhibit.
He said the statue had arrived in Edinburgh on Saturday morning and
was unpacked with incredible care. ''The sculpture was covered with
talcum powder to ensure the ladies did not rub against the packing,''
said Mr Clifford.
The celebrated 1817 marble statue is the centrepiece of a Canova
exhibition. The surviving preliminary drawings and terracotta models
made by Canova in preparation for the sculpture, which was commissioned
by the Duke of Bedford for the Temple of Graces in the grounds of Woburn
Abbey, are also on show.
The sculpture is owned jointly by the National Galleries of Scotland
and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, who have equal display
rights. Both organisations got together to mount an eleventh-hour rescue
bid to secure it for the nation.
It had been due to be exported to the J Paul Getty Museum. However,
successive export bans provided the V &amp; A and the National Galleries of
Scotland with a crucial opportunity to match the Getty offer. The
sculpture finally was bought in August 1994 with the help of #3m from
the National Heritage Memorial Fund, the private donation from J Paul
Getty II, and Baron Thyssen, who contributed #800,000.

WHEN Graeme Paterson dived into a swimming pool in the Canary Islands
to save his little sister's life, he was worried at first that he would
get a row from his parents.
The 10-year-old had been told to keep out of the water for a few days
because his legs had been badly blistered by the sun.
Graeme, of Carlaverock Crescent, Tranent, East Lothian, went to the
rescue of his four-year-old sister, Kirsty, when she fell into the pool
at the apartments in Gran Canaria where the family was staying in May
last year. Kirsty, a non-swimmer, had overbalanced as she filled up her
water-pistol from the pool.
Despite having little swimming experience and no life-saving tuition,
Graeme jumped straight in. He dived to the bottom of the pool, grabbed
Kirsty, and swam with her to the edge, where another boy took her from
him.
Kirsty escaped injury but Graeme experienced some pain because of the
burns on his legs.
Yesterday, at a ceremony at Lothian and Borders Police headquarters in
Edinburgh, he received the Royal Humane Society Testimonial on Parchment
for bravery. His mother, Elizabeth, 37, said that, after the rescue,
Graeme, a pupil at Tranent Primary School, was very upset and crying:
''He thought he was going to get a row for defying our orders.''
Graeme's father, Mr Angus Paterson, a 39-year-old police constable,
said they were very proud of him.

Moscow
RUSSIA'S counter-intelligence service detained a captain from the US
West Point military academy near a secret nuclear plant but freed him
after a few hours, the American embassy said today.
Press officer Richard Hoagland said Russian defence ministry officials
told the embassy that the security service had detained US army Captain
Jason Lynch for several hours last Thursday near the secret Siberian
city of Krasnoyarsk-26.
''The American embassy has not yet been in touch with Captain Lynch
but is continuing its efforts to reach him to hear his side of the
story,'' he said.
''We have received contradictory reports whether or not he is still in
Russia.''
Russia's Itar-Tass news agency said Lynch had been detained carrying
out ''unsanctioned'' work near the Krasnoyarsk-26 mining and chemical
complex -- one of Russia's biggest atomic centres.
Hoagland said Lynch had been working with Russian scientists in the
Krasnoyarsk area.
Krasnoyarsk-26, one of dozens of closed cities across the former
Soviet Union, was set up in 1954 to make plutonium for nuclear bombs.
The US Defence Department denied that Lynch had been spying.--Reuter.

<HEADLINE>Strict drivers' dress code and vehicle restrictions are causing discontent in the ranks. No smiles at airport charm offensive</HEADLINE>

TAXI drivers at Glasgow Airport are being instructed to smarten up
their act and turn on the charm under a new regime starting next month.
A strict dress code and courses in ''customer relations'' are among
changes planned by a new management agency appointed by the airport to
oversee the operation of taxis there.
However, some drivers are concerned about some of the changes --
particularly a requirement for all vehicles to be no more than four
years old.
As well as being licensed by the local authority, taxis require a
#465-a-year permit from the airport to operate there. In an effort to
improve the service, the airport recently invited tenders from
interested parties.
The management agency contract has been won by a company called
Cab-Fly, set up by partners Mr Brian Connolly and Mr William Stewart,
who between them have more than 40 years' experience of working the
airport rank. The appointment takes effect from September 1.
From then, any vehicle being renewed will have to be no more than four
years old and coloured white. All vehicles, except purpose-built ones,
will have to meet these criteria by April, 1998.
A dress code for drivers will demand that they wear a white or pale
blue shirt, plain navy blue tie, tailored trousers, and shoes. Track
suits, T-shirts, denims, trainers, and baseball caps will all be banned.
In addition, drivers will be required to undergo a training session,
and annual refresher courses, on customer relations. The company also
plans to introduce a complaints procedure for members of the public.
Mr Connolly said: ''The aim is a general upgrading of the taxi service
for the benefit of the customer. Taxi drivers at the airport have had a
terrible press over the years. I do not know if that is well founded or
not but we want to improve the image anyway.''
A particular source of concern to the airport authority has been
short-distance hires. Drivers can sometimes wait an hour or two in the
rank only to pick up a fare of #2 or #3 and face another long wait on
their return. Some customers have complained of unpleasantness from
drivers in these circumstances.
Cab-Fly is proposing a voucher system that will enable a taxi
returning from such a journey to take up a designated place on the rank.
Of the 200 airport permit holders, more than half are members of the
Airport Taxi Services Association, which submitted its own proposals to
the airport management on ways to improve the operation. Its scheme
included a similar solution to the short-hire problem as well as
customer-relations training and a dress code.
However, ATS chairman Charlie Mitchell said of the Cab-Fly plan: ''We
feel the airport is being heavy-handed on one or two points. We are not
averse to change but this is taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut.
''The rule on the age of cars is going to put a tremendous financial
burden on drivers. A two-year-old car can be a bigger mess than a
10-year-old car. It all depends how it is looked after.''
He added that the new dress code was ''a bit on the harsh side. I know
they want to improve standards of appearance but they could have made it
just a smart shirt and tie without making it virtually a uniform.''
A meeting between representatives of Cab-Fly, the airport management,
and the ATS and other taxi associations, is expected to take place today
to discuss the new arrangements.
The ATS has the support of local Labour MP Tommy Graham, who has
expressed its concerns to the airport management. Mr Graham said last
night: ''The only people who can run an effective service are a majority
of the taxi drivers themselves.''
He added: ''We know that over the years there have been some
difficulties because of short hires. Sometimes one or two drivers have
over-reacted. But the quality of service is far greater than at most
other airports in the country.''
A spokesman for Glasgow Airport said the decision to seek a management
agency had been prompted not so much by complaints but by the fact the
number of passengers using the airport had grown considerably. ''When
you have 5.5 million passengers each year, you have to make sure that
the taxi service operates in the best manner possible.''

AN employee phoned his work yesterday and said he would not be coming
back to his #84-a- week job apart from to collect his cards. He had won
#5,128,025, half the jackpot, on the National Lottery.
Mark and Rachael Lund were on their first holiday for seven years with
their three children, at Butlin's in Skegness, when they realised they
had won.
Money problems have forced the couple to live hundreds of miles apart.
Last night, they were planning to extend their reunion by taking a
holiday in Spain.
Mr Lund, 31, was made redundant from the Army at the beginning of the
year after serving as a tank commander in Germany.
Since they returned, he has been working at a Superdrug factory in
Doncaster. Mrs Lund, 28, and the children were living with relatives in
Pewsey, Wiltshire, because they could not afford a house.
The couple have two sons, Thomas, seven, and Joshua, three, and a
daughter Ashlee, 17 months.
Mr Lund said he picked the numbers at random but chose 20 lines
instead of his normal 10.
''I'm glad I did. I only ever do 20 lines on roll-over week, but we
were on holiday and I didn't do it the week before,'' he said.
The couple said their only spending spree would be to buy a house so
that they could live together, and a large car. They also want to take a
holiday in Disneyland.
Mr Lund said he had phoned the Superdrug factory, where he earns #84 a
week take-homepay from a 20-hour week.
''I phoned them to explain and said to them I would be back in a
couple of weeks to collect my cards. But after that I won't be going
back.''
He now hopes to work part-time on a voluntary basis.
''I want to work again. I could not stay at home -- I think we would
kill each other,'' he said.
The family have lived apart since Mr Lund was made compulsorily
redundant from the Army and returned from Germany last November.
His #30,000 pay-off package has already been spent.
Asked whether it had been a tough year for his family, he said: ''Yes,
in terms of living apart and moving around the country to find a new
job.''
The couple met eight years ago at a disco in Pewsey and married in
Devizes in June 1993.
Mr Lund plans to use his free time to learn to rally drive. His wife
said: ''I want to learn to drive.''

Statistics released yesterday show women in the twentieth century are
moving away from stereotypical lifestyles to redefine their roles in
society and shape new existences. Kirsty Scott analyses a most revealing
report
There has been a very slight improvement in women's earnings over the
last few years, but it's been extremely slow and uneven across Scotland.
PETER KELLY, researcher, Scottish Low Pay Unit
In general terms, women's positions have improved somewhat . . . we
still have a long, long way to go. MARIE-LOUISE MAKRIS, The National
Alliance of Women's Organisations
HARDER-WORKING, better-educated, longer-living, environmentally
conscious, politically puny, and possibly overweight -- the Central
Statistical Office has come up with an apparently definitive series of
images for women in Britain in the 1990s.
Using reams of facts and figures from separate studies, the CSO has
fleshed out a complex collection of female characters, from a
sweet-toothed and politically-naive teenager to a career-minded and
financially astute 30-year-old. Their report: Social Focus on Women, is
the latest in a series of studies dissecting the lives of UK residents.
The authors say the report's key theme is the changing nature of
women's roles. Across the board, women are shelving the lifestyles
adopted by or forced upon their mothers and grandmothers to shape new
lives. But they say the figures still flag up glaring inequalities
whether it's on the pay scale, in the boardroom, or at the ballot box.
The report is broken down into a variety of areas covering everything
from child-bearing and dental work to earning potential and TV habits.
SOCIAL
IN the social sphere, the report reveals that women are still a
dominant force in the home, but they say the traditional distinction
between the woman's role as homemaker and the man's role as breadwinner
has been eroded.
The figures show that 56% of women are married, but more are
cohabiting than in the past -- 22% now compared to just 12% two years
earlier. In total, 17% of women are living alone, but this rises to 54%
in the 70-plus age bracket.
Women are also now marrying later and postponing pregnancy. The
average age for marriage in 1993 was 26, compared to 28 for men; and
more women in their thirties are having children than women in their
twenties -- 87 births per thousand in women between 30 and 34, compared
to 82 births per thousand in women between 20 and 24. In addition,
fertility rates of women in their early forties have increased during
the past decade, and there has been a steady rise in the number who have
never had children. Only 13% of women born in 1947 were childless by the
time they reached 40, but it's now expected that more than a fifth of
women born in 1967 will be childless when they reach the same age.
The proportion of families with a single parent has risen from 7% in
1971 to 20% in 1993-1994, and nine out of 10 single parents are female.
CAREER
THE report's authors say one of the most fundamental changes in the UK
labour market this century had been the increasing participation of
women, particularly when it comes to part-time work. They say, however,
that marked occupational differences do still exist and women remain the
lower earners. Despite the imbalances, however, they insist the roles of
men and women in the workplace are not as clear cut as they once were.
The figures show that more than half of the UK's 24 million women were
''economically active'' last year, with a quarter working full-time and
a further fifth working part-time. In 1994, 53% of women were working
compared to 44% in 1971, and the figure is expected to rise to 57% by
the year 2006.
In part-time work, the number of women has risen in the past 10 years
by 19% to 5.1m. In 1994, 45% of women in employment worked part-time,
five times more than the number of men.
Three-quarters of people working in clerical and secretarial
occupations are women, as are two-thirds of those in personal service
jobs. Only a third of managers and administrators are women, but women
outnumber men four to one in health posts and two-to one in education.
The report does note that even within those industries in which women
predominate they tend to be found in less senior posts. In Scotland, 95%
of nursery and primary school teachers were women, but only 6% were head
or deputy head teachers.
In traditionally male spheres, however, women have made some very
small inroads, with a 5% rise in the number of female police constables
in the past 10 years and a 3% rise in the number of female army officers
in the past 20 years.
The report found that women with young children are less likely to
work; just under half with a child aged below five were working in 1994
compared to three-quarters whose youngest child was between 11 and 15.
Attitudes to working mums remain pretty harsh with only 5% of Britons
believing a mother should work full-time.
For women born in the early 1900s, a third who had turned 30 and had
children also held down a job. That figure rose to 50% for those born in
the 1940s and is now at 70% for those who turned 30 in the 1990s.
The study also found that women who take a career break tend to lose
and not regain status if they return to the workplace.
When it comes to pay, women remain firmly at the lower end of the
scale. A third of women earned #190 a week or less compared with 13% of
men, and women earned more than their partner in only 13% of couples.
The report estimated that on average women have roughly half as much
''independent income'' as men.
HEALTH
IN general terms women fare better on the health front than men and
enjoy a longer lifespan -- in 1993, 750,000 women in the UK were aged 85
or over, and a girl born in 1993 can expect to live to 79.
However, women are facing a series of crucial health issues, with
cardiovascular disease one of the top killers. In addition, more than
40% of women now say they suffer from some form of chronic disease.
Dental health has improved somewhat. In 1993-1994 fewer than one-fifth
of women had no natural teeth, a third less than 10 years ago.
Weight, however, remains a problem. Almost one half of women in the
south are either overweight or obese. Young women have the sweetest
tooth with more than half of 16 to 24-year-olds eating sweets at least
three days a week.
Stress is also a common complaint with around one in seven women
saying they experience quite a lot or a great deal of tension.
SOCIETY/POLITICS
THE study concluded that while women were more likely to be
better-educated than their mothers, they were still under-represented in
the ranks of power, policy and decision-making. But the researchers
suggested that few women were particularly bothered about politics,
quoting one study which found that less than 7% were very interested in
the topic. In Parliament itself, the number of female MPs continues to
grow with 60 women elected in 1992; now almost 10%, compared to 4% in
1983. The number of women serving on local authorities has also risen
marginally from 17% in 1976 to 25% in 1993.
On environmental issues, a total of 87% of women say they are
interested and around half will save newspapers for recycling. On crime,
women are less likely than men to offend and make up just 4% of the
prison population. They are, however, more likely to feel unsafe than
men, except in Scotland, where men are more likely to feel unsafe when
out alone at night.
In England and Wales women fear burglary, mugging, and car theft most
while in Scotland they fear rape.
LEISURE
TO relax, women are most likely to watch TV or entertain friends and
relatives, followed by listening to the radio, tapes and CDs. The most
popular time for women to watch TV is between 7.30pm and 8.30pm, when
the soap operas are on.  Women are less likely to read newspapers than
men -- 56% compared to 64% -- and the Sun and the Daily Mirror are the
two female favourites. More women read Take a Break magazine than any
other, and more are now browsing through men's magazines. Walking is the
exercise of choice, followed by yoga and swimming.

TWELVE RAF helicopters flew out yesterday for Croatia in a move to
boost the mobility of United Nations troops and equipment in the war
zone.
The six Puma and six Chinook aircraft, with UN markings, took off from
Odiham, Hampshire. They are expected to arrive at Ploce in Croatia late
this afternoon after a refuelling stop at Nice.
It is the first large deployment by the RAF in the former Yugoslavia
and about 700 personnel are joining the helicopter force to make a
self-contained unit.
The unit will be part of the UK's 24 Airmobile Brigade and will assist
in moving troops and equipment which have been arriving in Croatia over
the last few weeks during the build-up of the UN Rapid Reaction Force.
Group Captain Peter Crawford said before flying out in a Chinook as
the detachment commander that it was not yet clear what exact role the
helicopters, drawn from 33 Squadron and 7 Squadron, would play.
But they would bring a ''great capability'' to the UN protection
forces, with the Chinooks capable of carrying 10 tonnes of stores and 50
people and the Puma two and a half tonnes and 12 people.
Meanwhile, a British charity has enlisted former Yugoslav royalty in
an appeal for people to donate gold jewellery to help refugees on all
sides in the conflict.
Crown princess Katherine donated a gold chain and earring to the
British charity Lifeline's appeal for people to hand over their unwanted
finery at the London jewellers Bentley's. The donated gold will be
melted down and sold.
Yugoslavia became a republic in 1945 when communists under Josip Tito
took control of the country, ending the reign of King Peter. His son,
Crown Prince Alexander, was born in London where he still lives.

Colombo, Tuesday
A TAMIL Tiger suicide bomber who killed 24 people by detonating
plastic explosive hidden in a cart full of coconuts had been ordered to
search for and destroy ''a motorcade with tinted windows'', police said
today.
The bomber, an Indian Tamil, was stopped with an accomplice in a
Colombo suburb on Sunday, the day before the bomb blast, pushing the
cart, but only the accomplice was detained, police said.
The accomplice said after the blast in Colombo's fashionable embassy
district that their mission had been to detonate the bomb near a
motorcade with tinted windows, Colombo police chief G B Kotakadeniya
said.
He said he did not know why the bomber, believed by police to be a
member of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), had targeted the
council offices where the bomb went off.
The bomber had been given a mission by the intelligence chief of the
Tamil Tiger rebels to wheel his cart until he found his target and then
blow it up, Kotakadeniya said.
Police sources said his target had been more specifically a motorcade
either carrying President Chandrika Kumaratunga or her deputy defence
minister.
Twenty-two people were killed and over 40 wounded yesterday when the
bomber set off 11lb of plastic explosives outside the offices of the
chief minister of the western provincial council. Two more the victims
died today.
''We questioned them. The bomber could speak Sinhalese and said he was
merely selling king coconuts, and he was allowed to go off,''
Kotakadeniya told Reuters. ''But the other man could not answer'' and
was detained.--Reuter.

<TEXT>
THE United States yesterday rebutted Defence Secretary Michael
Portillo's claims that Croatia had carried out ''ethnic cleansing'' in
Krajina.
The US Ambassador to Croatia, Mr Peter Galbraith, told BBC radio the
Croatian advance might prove positive by providing an opportunity to
negotiate a settlement to the region's conflict.
''We think the Bosnian Serb leadership might now recognise the new
realities and that this might, in fact, be an opportunity to reach a
negotiated settlement on a fair basis,'' he said.
When asked about Mr Portillo's criticism of the weekend offensive by
Zagreb, Mr Galbraith said: ''It is not ethnic cleansing.
''Ethnic cleansing is a practice sponsored by the leadership in
Belgrade carried out by the Bosnian Serbs and also by the Croatian Serbs
of forcibly expelling the local population, whether it was Muslim or
Croat, using terror tactics,'' he added.
Mr Portillo said on Monday that ''where people are driven from their
homes and where they have lived in those places for generations, that
amounts to ethnic cleansing,'' he said.
The US hopes of peace were echoed in Moscow where President Boris
Yeltsin's government sought Western support for his plan to bring
Croatian and Serbian leaders together in the Russian capital for talks.
''The Russian initiative requires the deepest studying. It is being
studied and we are counting on support,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman
Mikhail Demurin said.
Mr Demurin was speaking after a Russian representative spelled out Mr
Yeltsin's idea to ambassadors of the other members of the Contact Group
on former Yugoslavia -- the US, Germany, France and Britain.
Mr Demurin said the Yeltsin plan had been outlined by the president
during a walkabout in the Kremlin grounds on Monday. But he was vague
over how much support the initiative had received so far from Croatia,
Serbia and the Contact Group.

Belgrade, Zagreb
THE former Serb allies started to break apart today when Bosnian Serb
leader Radovan Karadzic castigated his former patron, Serbian President
Slobodan Milosevic, accusing him of cynical treachery to the Serb cause
for abandoning Serb Krajina.
The thundering denunciation in an open letter delivered by the Bosnian
Serb news agency SRNA raised the heat in a dispute between the two men
that has smouldered for months.
Their falling out comes as tension rose between victorious Croatia and
Mr Milosevic's Serb troops along the border of the last Serbian enclave
in Croatia, Eastern Slavonia, where soldiers and tanks were moving into
positions.
At issue between the Serb leaders is whether prosperous security for
all Serbs is to be found down Dr Karadzic's path of war or Mr
Milosevic's new diplomatic road towards peace. Both claim their policy
as the most valid version of Serb nationalism.
''You have turned your back on the Serb cause,'' Dr Karadzic wrote to
the powerful Serbian President, the man who backed his insurrection in
Bosnia and supplied the separatist Serb armed forces that now hold 70%
of Bosnian territory.
''You have started ceding to outside pressure to the extent it borders
on treason,'' said Dr Karadzic, accusing Mr Milosevic of failing to
prevent the Croatian army offensive that took the entire Krajina region,
bar Eastern Slavonia, in four days.
''Your regime offered sterile condemnations,'' Dr Karadzic said of
Serbia's muted response to the Croatian assault.
''You destroyed Serb forces in RSK (the self-styled Serb republic in
Krajina) with political games. You deceived the people with guarantees
of a political settlement.''
Mr Milosevic dropped his support for Dr Karadzic after the Bosnian
Serb parliament refused to sign a peace deal dividing Bosnia, and
antagonism has since grown between the communist apparatchik and the
psychiatrist turned politician.
Now it has developed into a schism as the Serbian president has moved
from the strident nationalism that brought him to power to embrace
publicly a longing for peace in the hope that UN trade sanctions will
ease.
Diplomats say Mr Milosevic has been trying to engineer Dr Karadzic's
removal for months. The Bosnian Serb leader has survived, backed by a
powerful police force that protects him in the mountain village
stronghold of Pale, outside Sarajevo.
But Dr Karadzic's fears have grown and an attempt last week to demote
his army commander, General Ratko Mladic, known to be close to Mr
Milosevic, reflected worry that he was being undermined.
A letter Mr Milosevic sent to General Mladic urging peace talks and
by-passing Dr Karadzic was an attempt to betray the Bosnian Serbs just
as the Krajina Serbs were tricked, Dr Karadzic complained.
General Mladic has fought back, rebelling against Dr Karadzic's
demotion move and prompting his entire staff of generals to close ranks
behind their commander.
The last member of the general staff not to have declared an
allegiance, Gen Dragomir Milosevic, commander of the Sarajevo-Romanija
Corps, today joined his 18 colleagues in defying Dr Karadzic.
The generals turned their backs on the Bosnian Serb leader after he
announced on Friday he was assuming command of the army and demoting Gen
Mladic to the newly created post of liaison officer between the Bosnian
Serb army and Croatian Serb troops.
The declaration by Gen Milosevic, who is not related to the Serbian
president, is another bitter blow to Dr Karadzic who can now count only
on police forces in his smaller, eastern part of Bosnia.
Dr Karadzic has been backed by the Bosnian Serb assembly, leaving
battlelines drawn between politicians and the military, and Pale and
Banja Luka, the major Serb-held town in western Bosnia where the army is
based.
The strident language of Dr Karadzic's letter gave way in its final
lines to a plea to Mr Milosevic to redeem himself by coming to the
rescue of Krajina, a call that revealed by its insecurity which of the
two men would prevail, diplomats said.
A widening rift could complicate the situation in Eastern Slavonia,
the last Serb-held enclave in Croatia, but diplomats described the
situation there as sabre-rattling rather than a slide towards a new and
more dangerous war.
In New York the Croatian envoy to the UN, Mr Mario Nobilo, said
tonight that he had told the Security Council that Croatian troops would
not attack Eastern Slavonia.
''It is not the intention of my government to launch an offensive in
Sector East, because that is rather sensitive,'' he told reporters,
using the UN designation for the region.
''It is our intention to put this remaining occupied sector of Croatia
into the whole peace package,'' he added.
In a letter to the UN, handed over by Mr Nobilo, his foreign minister,
Mr Mate Granic wrote that the Croatian offensive had ''achieved all its
strategic aims''.
Diplomats believe that, though flushed with military success and
emotionally intent on winning back Vukovar, the region's main city,
Croatia would still not risk provoking Serbia's powerful armed forces.

Sabac, Serbia
KRAJINA Serb refugees feel abandoned by the world and betrayed by
their patrons in Serbia after Croatian troops overran their
centuries-old communities.
''Why is it that when we are expelled, no-one cares?'' said Ruzica,
one of tens of thousands of refugees who have fled to Serbia after the
sudden fall of the Krajina region.
''I wonder if anyone really cares to see this, if people have any
heart for us,'' she said a day after arriving at a crowded refugee camp
here.
The refugees turned their anger on Western governments which, they
said, were eager to sympathise with Croatian or Bosnian Muslim refugees
but seemed to tolerate the suffering of Serb civilians.
Serb soldiers who have managed to escape mill around the refugee camp
brooding over their defeat. They sneer at foreign reporters asking to
interview them.
One elderly man said: ''There is nothing you need to ask us. Just look
at our eyes. That will tell you everything. What you see is a tragedy.''
Perhaps what has disappointed and infuriated the refugees most was
Serbia's failure to intervene against the Croatian onslaught.
''The war was for nothing. It killed our youth, destroyed our houses
and ruined our lives,'' said another woman from Knin.
Inside a sporting hall, exhausted refugees sat on mattresses in a
gymnasium, brushing away mosquitoes in the stifling summer heat. Some
rocked back and forth listlessly, staring into the distance.
Dusan Grba said he had rarely visited Serbia before the war started
four years ago. The Croatian capital Zagreb was much closer to his
hometown of Plaski.
Now he finds himself at a refugee camp in Sabac, trying to accept a
future in a country that has never been his home.
He stared at the ground, trying to hold back his tears. ''The older I
get, the more nostalgic I get for more my homeland. And my homeland is
there.''
For others who have not yet reached the safety of Serbia, it was
another day of heat and fatigue as huge columns of refugees continued to
crawl across northern Bosnia.
''The condition of the refugees is very bad,'' said Stephan Oberreit,
Belgrade head of the Medecins Sans Frontieres medical charity. ''They
are very tired and very stressed. They left their homes during fighting.
Many have problems with the sun,'' said Mr Oberreit. ''We have seen many
nervous breakdowns.''
Old women sat under flimsy umbrellas on the backs of tractors
trundling across Bosnia. Columns of traffic headed in an arc from
abandoned homes in Krajina towards Yugoslavia.
''It is not a humanitarian catastrophe but it is very close to that,''
said Josue Anselmo, spokesman for the International Committee of the Red
Cross in Belgrade.
The ICRC's priority was now to distribute water to the refugee columns
where many were dehydrated, he said. It also hoped to begin an emergency
airlift to Banja Luka tomorrow, the first aid planes into the pariah
Serb area.
But for others the Croatian victory brought welcome relief. At Licko
Petrovo Selo, on Croatia's border with the Bosnian Muslim Bihac enclave
Mrs Izeta Cimalovic stole out to look for food in abandoned Serb homes,
in shabby clothes, her bones discernible through her T-shirt.
''Look, biscuits!'' said the woman, who weighed no more than 90lbs, as
she scavenged for food left behind by residents who fled in panic. ''I
haven't see any for the last three years.''
Mrs Cimalovic was one of hundreds of starving residents of Bihac,
which has been under siege for three years, who trekked the three miles
to the border village. -- Reuter/AP.

Paris
FRANCE, undaunted by domestic and international opposition to its
decision to resume nuclear testing, dismissed a threat by New Zealand
today to take it to the World Court as domestic politicking.
Foreign ministry spokesman Yves Doutriaux said both sides had to
consent to take a dispute to the International Court of Justice in The
Hague and, ''in the case of France, there is no such agreement''.
He said President Jacques Chirac had decided to hold a final seven or
eight underground tests at France's South Pacific site on Mururoa Atoll
on national security grounds and so could not yield to pressure to scrap
them.
European Affairs Minister Michel Barnier said Chirac would not bow to
pressure to cancel the tests.
The influential newspaper Le Monde urged Chirac yesterday to go back
on his controversial decision. But the pro-government Le Figaro said
today the president had no reason to change his mind.
Adding new vitriol to the war of words on the nuclear issue, Le Figaro
editor Franz-Olivier Giesbert wrote in an open letter to Australian
Prime Minister Paul Keating that after the way the Australians had
treated the Aborigines, they had no right to invoke ecology, colonialism
and human rights.
''When the first European immigrants arrived, there were 300,000
Aborigines in Australia. By 1921, there were only 60,000. Guess what
happened in between,'' Giesbert wrote.
Meanwhile, the president of the French wine exporters' association
said anti-nuclear boycotts seemed to be hurting French wine sales not
just in the South Pacific but also in northern Europe.--Reuter.

Zagreb
THE last pockets of rebel Krajina Serbs began surrendering tonight
after a UN-mediated pact was agreed to allow tens of thousands of Serb
refugees trapped by fighting to evacuate safely to Bosnia.
Some 87,000 refugees including armed rebels and their families were
cornered when the Croatian army turned to mopping up isolated pockets of
resistance after its conquest of virtually the entire separatist
enclave.
A statement by Croatian army supreme commander General Zvonimir
Cervenko read out on state television said Serb forces had begun
surrendering in exchange for safe passage of refugees out to Serb-held
parts of Bosnia.
Gen Cervenko said a rebel officer named Bulat had under his command up
to 4000 soldiers, 13 tanks, 15 130mm artillery guns, a large number of
vehicles and other equipment. About 10,000 refugees were close to
Bulat's forces, Gen Cervenko said.
The report comes hours after Bosnian government troops set Serb
villages ablaze and the Croatian army shelled rebels.
The UN, racing to save thousands of Serb refugees caught in combat,
brokered the understanding between rebel Serbs and the Croatian army to
let civilians leave in safety, officials said.
''They appear to have come to a general understanding for a ceasefire
in a meeting we mediated in Topusko,'' a UN officer said, referring to a
town jammed by some 30,000 refugees with more on roads to nearby Bosnia
exposed to Croatian attack.
Fighting was reported to have slackened off outside Topusko and along
would-be refugee routes towards the Bosnian border in the late
afternoon, UN spokeswoman Leah Melnick said.
A follow-up meeting to implement the deal was arranged for dusk in
nearby Glina, captured by the Croats two days ago.
The Topusko pact looked shaky because Bosnian government troops, who
helped Croatia crush the rebels and started torching Serb homes in
reprisal for past Serb incursions into Bosnia, were not a party to it.
But the UN said Bosnian army 5th Corps officers were expected to join
the meeting in Glina.
Serb refugees were shelled earlier near the border town of Bosanski
Novi and there were casualties.
''We have reports that refugees were shelled near Bosanski Novi on
Tuesday and that there were many wounded,'' said Mans Nyberg, a UN High
Commissioner for Refugees spokesman in Sarajevo.
UN spokeswoman Major Rita Lepage said roads towards Dvor, a main river
crossing from Croatia to Bosnia, were packed with refugees. Dvor was
shelled by the Croatian army in the morning, blocking the retreat of
refugees and armed Serbs.
Bosnian Serb hospital sources said five people died in an attack on a
refugee column near Petrovac in north-west Bosnia on Monday.
Ukrainian peacekeepers in observation posts west of Dvor saw at least
six villages burning after Bosnian 5th Corps attacks.
''The Ukrainians have also heard small-arms fire and screaming of
inhabitants. These may be reprisals for earlier Krajina Serb attacks on
Bihac or just undisciplined soldiers,'' Major Lepage said.
As defeated Croatian Serb soldiers cross into Bosnia, the question is
being asked whether they are spoiling for another fight or fleeing to
safety as a routed and demoralised army.
The answer is awaited by the UN, foreign diplomats and -- most of all
-- by Bosnia's Muslim-led government. It could have a significant effect
on the military balance in Bosnia.
The retreating Serb troops could substantially strengthen the Bosnian
Serb army if their units are coming over the border intact and fighting
mad and especially if they bring any heavy weapons with them.
* Bosnian Foreign Minister Mohamed Sacirbey said Croatia had reassured
him there was no truth in rumours of a Croatian-Serbian plot to carve up
Bosnia between them.

CLASS sizes in Scottish schools are set to rise as a result of the
inexorable cuts in local authority spending, Scottish Liberal Democrat
leader Jim Wallace said yesterday.
He said his party would make the issue the main focus of its summer
campaign, seeking signatures on a petition to spark a ''roar of
protest'' against the Government's underfunding of education.
Mr Wallace claimed that cuts of almost 10% over the next three years
would push new councils -- some of which will have inherited more than
their share of maintenance backlogs -- into deep cuts in teacher
numbers.
He produced figures to show that more than 600 teaching posts had been
lost in Scotland in the last year, at a time when the scope for other
cuts was being lost.
Mr Wallace said: ''What better indication can there be of this
Government's priorities than that it is prepared to sacrifice our
children's future to pay for desperate pre-election tax bribes.''
His party has been prepared to campaign on the basis of one penny on
the tax rate and, he said, without this, children would suffer as the
Government pauperises schools.
''As children go back to school this autumn, we call on all Scots
parents to back our campaign to stop the cuts going any further.''

GOVERNMENT spending on benefits will be cut by #4000m annually by the
end of the century, Social Security Secretary Peter Lilley said
yesterday.
Policy changes in this area would, in the long term, amount to savings
of around #14,000m a year, he added.
Mr Lilley, who was responding to a recent report by a select committee
of MPs into social security spending, said: ''I welcome the select
committee's recognition that the uncontrolled and unplanned growth of
social security is a cause for concern.
''The Government has already made substantial progress in curbing the
growth of social security expenditure.
''Policy changes I have already announced will, by the end of the
century, have reduced expenditure by #4000m a year and, in the longer
term, by #14,000m annually.
''In addition, I have implemented a strategy to crack down on fraud
and abuse. It should save the taxpayer #2500m over the next three
years.''
But Mr Lilley said he did not agree with the committee that
means-tested benefits were destructive, adding: ''These, as with all
statutory benefits, have distinctive effects.
''That is why the Government's reforms have focused, not on extending
means testing, but on changing the conditions of entitlement to
benefit.'' The real issue was how to reduce dependency on state
benefits.
Ways of encouraging people to be more independent include the
Jobseeker's Allowance, the new Family Credit rules, and a rebate of
National Insurance contributions for employers taking someone who has
been unemployed for a long time.
Mr Lilley said: ''The Government remains committed to providing a
safety net to ensure that the most vulnerable are protected. However,
people should be encouraged to make their own provision where they are
able to do so.''
Shadow Social Security Secretary Donald Dewar said: ''The Government,
in its response, has not faced up to its responsibility for many of
today's problems.
''The Social Security budget has been forced ever higher by the costs
of recession and economic mismanagement. It has been inflated in some
areas by deliberate Government policy. If Ministers artificially drive
up rents, they can hardly complain when the Housing Benefit bill goes
through the roof.
''There is a need for better social return on the money spent, but
present policies are not providing the answers.''
He said the ''protestations have a hollow ring when, after 16 years of
Conservative control, one third of the families in this country contain
someone who is in receipt of a means-tested benefit''.
A Department of Social Security spokesman said Mr Lilley's comment
about #14,000m worth of cuts in the ''longer term'', referred to the
21st century.

SCOTLAND'S leading poll tax lawyer has challenged the ''myth'' that
local authorities are obliged to continue chasing community charge debts
two years after the tax was abolished.
Mr Gordon Dangerfield, who has successfully represented more than 400
poll tax cases, yesterday said finance directors across Scotland were
perpetrating the idea that they were legally bound to chase defaulters
when in reality they were pursuing ''cash windfalls'' for their
councils.
Mr Dangerfield's challenge came on the day it was revealed that one
third of Scotland's poorest people are still being pursued over poll tax
arrears by local authority finance departments.
Figures published by Social Security Minister Roger Evans show that
48,000 Scots are still having community charge arrears deducted from
their income support benefits.
Under Social Security rules, claimants can lose up to one quarter of
their benefit through deductions and two years after the tax was
abolished thousands are paying off their debt at amounts starting at #2
or #3 a week.
This form of collection will annually recoup an estimated #5.7m debt
owed to Scotland's local authorities. Since 1991 the deductions for poll
tax arrears from Social Security benefits have increased by 407% from
#1.4m.
A further #31m is currently being deducted from 95,000 Scots each year
to meet Social Fund loan repayments.
Across the UK more than half a million poll tax debtors are having
#64.3m clawed back in this manner each year, while 665,000 benefit
claimants are repaying #214.7m in Social Fund repayments.
Last night a Labour Party spokesman claimed that the state safety net
was ''giving way'' under the strain of the poll tax debt collection.
''The legacy of the poll tax lives on and continues to cause misery
years after its abolition,'' said Mr Alan Milburn, MP for Darlington.
''More and more families have been dragged into a deeper poverty trap
by being forced to live at below official subsistence levels. Government
policy has created a spiral of debt and despair.''
Mr Dangerfield, who is also a former Labour regional councillor, said
the method of debt collection was a national scandal and the result of a
''myth'' that local authority finance departments were legally bound to
collect poll tax debts from up to six years ago.
''The budgets for years back to 1989/90 are closed and they don't need
that cash any more,'' he said.
''There is no rule, for instance, that says when a council is
determining its budget for 1994/95, it must allow for collection of poll
tax arrears from 1989.''
He claimed that local councillors had abdicated responsibility and
''the men in grey suits'' in local authority finance departments ''freed
from democratic accountability were imposing this evil'' on those who
''couldn't afford to pay the poll tax in the first place''.
He went on: ''They are now being portrayed as dodgers to cough up cash
for nice little windfalls for council finance departments. It's about
time these council mandarins were challenged on this fundamental
misconception.''
Mr Dangerfield also called for pressure to be put on the Government to
declare an amnesty for all poll tax debtors.
However, Mr Archie Gillespie, Strathclyde Regional Council's director
of finance, said that local authorities had a duty to collect debts
wherever possible.
He added: ''There's nothing in statute that says you have to stop
trying after a certain time.''
He said that if people on benefit had applied for a rebate they would
have had to pay only 10% of their community charge bill, but now they
were saddled with debts of up to #1000.
''A lot of them were encouraged not to do anything about the bills,''
he said. ''Now instead of a small amount being collected, they are
paying off very big debts.''
Almost #600m is still owed in poll tax arrears across Scotland -- most
to Strathclyde and Lothian Regional Councils. Last year Strathclyde
wrote off more than #5.2m of its #360m debt because the debtors were
either deceased or had been sequestrated.
Given the significant level of non-payment, Strathclyde had provided
#321m of bad debt provision, leaving #39m that was not covered.
Mr Gillespie said: ''Once we collect the #39m, it will represent a
credit that could lead to a small reduction in council tax levels and
give some of the hard-pressed people who paid too much in the past some
of their money back.''

THE local government Ombudsman believes an increase in his powers
could help provide a mechanism to deal more quickly and effectively with
any future allegations about the conduct of Scottish councils.
In particular, he has highlighted his lack of power over staff
appointments and the commercial deals and contracts entered into by
councils.
''These are amongst the matters which have given rise to recent
allegations of unacceptable conduct and yet they are the very issues
which I cannot investigate,'' said Ombudsman Derrick Marks yesterday.
It was time to take another look at these and other areas which were
currently off limits to the Ombudsman, he stressed.
The conduct of Scottish local authorities has been under the spotlight
recently.
In addition to the Monklands inquiry into allegations of nepotism and
religious bias, and the probe into the use of public funds in Ferguslie
Park, Paisley, some of the new councils have been involved in rows over
appointments of senior staff.
Mr Marks may find himself pushing at an already open door in his quest
for wider jurisdiction, as two weeks ago Scottish Secretary Michael
Forsyth announced a joint Scottish Office/Cosla task force would look at
the rules governing the conduct of local government. Mr Forsyth said
then that such an investigation could result in more powers being given
to the Ombudsman.
Speaking after the publication of his annual report in Edinburgh, Mr
Marks said he welcomed the setting up of the task force.
He believed that, after reorganisation, the Ombudsman was the obvious
person to take up any complaints about the process of making council
appointments. His office should also be able to ensure that public
contracts were entered into by due process and without favouritism.
The overall level of complaints to the Ombudsman has stabilised in
recent years at just over 1000, with the number of housing complaints
falling from 336 to 327 in 1994-95.
However, within that housing total there has been a sharp rise, from
17% to 25%, in the number of complaints from tenants about anti-social
behaviour by neighbours.

TORY chiefs are planning a fresh crackdown on what they perceive as
media bias, with the establishment of a full-time news monitoring unit
at party headquarters in Westminster.
However, the main task of the unit, its director insists, will be to
compile information from interviews with Opposition MPs, as well as from
Commons debates, which can be used against the Tories' opponents at
election time.
In the past, the unit has been set up only for short periods, in the
run-up to a General Election or the European elections.
Dr Julian Lewis, joint deputy director of the Conservative Research
Department and director of the Media Monitoring Unit, insisted: ''This
is not being done solely, or even primarily, to campaign on the question
of bias.''
He said the unit would collate information for archive and research
purposes, and enhance the role of the Tory Research Department by
offering MPs access to a higher grade of political information.
Dr Lewis is seeking a meeting with Heritage Secretary Virginia
Bottomley to discuss strict impartiality laws being imposed on the BBC.
The unit lost no time in criticising the BBC over its programme,
Hiroshima: The Decision to Drop the Bomb, broadcast on Sunday.
The unit has suggested that the BBC remake the whole programme,
claiming it was based on revisionist views of ''radical left-wing''
historian Dr Gar Alperovitz.
A BBC spokeswoman said: ''The BBC stands by the integrity of this
programme and rejects any charge of bias or imbalance.''

<TEXT>
LABOUR said yesterday that a #5m advertising contract awarded to a
London agency to publicise the flotation of Railtrack was another
example of rail privatisation costs spiralling out of control.
The Government has committed itself to privatising Railtrack within
the lifetime of this Parliament.
The Department of Transport and Railtrack jointly awarded the contract
yesterday to WCRS (Wight Collins Rutherford Scott).
Labour's transport spokesman, Mr Henry McLeish, said: ''This #5m
really is a dreadful waste of money and yet another instance of the
enormous costs attached to a privatisation process that no-one except
this Government wants.''
Railtrack's proposed stock market flotation was first announced in
November 1994 by the then Transport Secretary, Dr Brian Mawhinney.
Railtrack is to be sold as a single unit. It owns and manages more
than 10,200 miles of track, with about 9000 bridges and viaducts and
1000 tunnels.
The 2500 passenger stations and other property owned by Railtrack will
generally be leased to private sector operators.
Railtrack's turnover in 1994-95 is expected to approach #2500m, with
most of the money coming from the track access charges paid by the
British Rail train companies.

<TEXT>
THE Government should scrap VAT on fuel to improve its popularity with
the voters and make big cuts in public spending, Conservative leadership
challenger John Redwood said yesterday.
Mr Redwood, who called for #5000m in tax cuts in his recent campaign
against Mr Major, spells out the details of his proposals in an article
in the Times.
He says of the removal of the 8% VAT on fuel: ''This single act would
cut the inflation rate substantially and that would mean savings on
every benefit that has to be increased in line with inflation, while
leaving benefit recipients better off because fuel is a bigger part of
their budget.''
His list of savings would include placing a staff freeze on the Civil
Service. After one year the numbers might be down by 5%. It would save
#340m. A crackdown on social security fraud would save #500m.
Ministry of Defence housing could be sold off and scaling down health
authorities could save #300m. Halting the closure of hospitals would
save cash.
As the economy improved it would not be necessary to put #1200m into
housing associations. More could be achieved by low-cost home ownership
schemes.
Private sector money should be used for urban renewal while #600m
could be saved in advertising and consultancy fees for quangos.
None of the measures, he said, would be very painful or especially
difficult.

<RECORDNO>976978061</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A PIT-BULL terrier which savaged a woman on the face, arm, and leg was
ordered to be destroyed at Dundee District Court yesterday.
Last night, Nurse Elaine Urquhart, 33, who needed plastic surgery
after the dog attacked her just yards from her home, greeted the verdict
with delight.
''I'm more than happy. This dog has ruined my life. I'm terrified to
go out now, dogs just completely scare me. I still suffer nightmares and
can't sleep properly,'' she said.
Justice Mrs Helen Wright ordered the pit-bull terrier, named Trouble,
be seized, put into kennels, and put down, but not until after August
16, in case of any appeal.
Ms Urquhart told the court earlier that she was attacked by an
alsatian and a pit-bull terrier in the close of her former home at
Buttars Loan, Dundee.
She explained that the pit bull had jumped up and grabbed her face in
its mouth. Ms Urquhart said that she was certain the dogs lived in the
house of neighbour Mrs Maureen Annand.
Mrs Annand, 43, of Buttars Loan, Dundee, was yesterday admonished
after she was found guilty earlier of allowing a dog in her charge to
bite Ms Urquhart on September 12, last year.
Earlier, she told the court that she heard a commotion in the close
and went out to see her pet alsatian Zara and a stray dog fighting. Her
then neighbour, Ms Urquhart, was lying at the bottom of the stairs with
blood on her face.
Yesterday, Justice Mrs Wright said she preferred Ms Urquhart's
evidence that she was attacked by an alsatian and a pit-bull terrier.

BRITAIN'S biggest mechanical car park will be built in the centre of
Glasgow to handle up to 634 cars.
The #6m first phase of the redevelopment of the Osborne Street site,
which runs parallel to the Trongate, is a joint venture between Skyparks
and Allied London Scottish Properties, which already owns the site
adjacent to ALSP Granite House.
The initial planning application was submitted on Monday for the gap
site adjacent to Granite House, which is being transferred from
light-industrial to high-quality office use.
It will be a total turnkey package whereby Skyparks will build the
park, which will rise to a height of 12 storeys and almost 100ft.
There will be a bronze glass finish somewhat similar to that at the St
Enoch Centre and it could be illuminated at night by laser-sourced
advertising.
Allied London Scottish Properties is a subsidiary of Allied London
Properties and has a property portfolio in Scotland worth about #25m. It
includes a residential golf development in Dundee, retail developments
in Wishaw and Larkhall, as well as offices in Stirling.
When the motorist drives into the car park, a ticket is issued that
activates the robot parking action. All people leave and the car, with
handbrake on and in gear, is automatically passed by under-tyre rollers
on to a robot transfer.
The car will be checked to make sure there is no-one inside while a
video record is made.
Skyparks was founded in Sweden five years ago and expects sales by
next year to total #40m. It has already sold systems to Budapest, Tel
Aviv, Mexico City, and Bangkok, while one near Tower Bridge in London is
at the planning consent stage.
It is already involved in a #3m, 300-car parking facility in the #38m
Edinburgh International Conference Centre, with a further 600 spaces in
Morrison Street, Edinburgh.
It is in negotiations for another three sites in Scotland that could
involve a total of more than 1000 car spaces.
One major advantage of the system is that it can pack an extra 50%
more cars into the same space as the traditional multi-storey car park.
There is also the considerable bonus of greatly increased security from
both personal attack and theft as there is no need to walk to the car,
which is delivered automatically to the driver. There is also a
reduction in exhaust emissions.
Skyparks director Bernie Dickson said yesterday that Glasgow had a
pressing need for additional parking. He added that charges would not be
any higher than those already being made on the site.
Soil testing and other initial work has already been completed and it
is possible that the whole development could be finished in about a
year.

STANDARDS in Glasgow housing estates were not a factor behind the
city's weekend of violence, Scottish Housing Minister Raymond Robertson
said yesterday during a tour of regeneration projects in Easterhouse,
where one of the killings took place.
Mr Robertson visited the Easthall Park housing co-operative, 400 yards
from Baldoven Crescent, where 46-year-old Mr John McFarlane was murdered
on Sunday.
The Minister said: ''I agree with the chief constable's assessment
that what happened at the weekend was a one-off. Housing work can affect
and improve the standard and quality of people's lives, but deprivation
is not to blame -- there is never a social reason for people to kill.''
However, Mr Robertson's remarks were condemned as ''completely out of
touch'' by Labour home affairs spokesman John McFall, MP, who said:
''Housing is the most basic amenity an individual or family can have and
must be regarded as a significant factor in influencing social
behaviour. At the weekend, such factors may have been considerable.''
Earlier, Mr Robertson called for residents in estates such as
Easterhouse to seek private investment for regeneration, adding: ''I
would encourage associations and co-operatives to be innovative and to
seize the opportunities to make the most of harnessing funds from the
private sector to fulfil their aims and objectives.''
Easthall Park, a tenants' co-operative, has refurbished 56 units for
local residents since 1992, in partnership with Scottish Homes and
Glasgow Development Agency.
Mr Robertson officially opened phase two of the project, which will
refurbish 42 homes and build a further 10 for low-cost family rental.

HOURS of study, unrelenting encouragement from her mother, and support
at school has meant exam success for a Down's Syndrome girl from
Lanarkshire.
Yesterday, a quietly-spoken but obviously proud Clare Henderson, 16,
from Newarthill, described how all her spare time had been dedicated to
passing five standard grades at her secondary school last term.
Clare studied English, French, history, science, and home economics.
She admitted the exams had been quite hard but felt she had done as well
as her classmates.
At home with her mother Helen, Clare said she intended to go back to
school after the summer holidays to continue her studies.
Mrs Henderson said she hoped her daughter's achievement would serve as
an inspiration to the parents of other Down's Syndrome children. ''I was
delighted that she passed her exams. Clare is a slow learner but works
hard and we have pushed her. Often children are thought of as 'just
Down's Syndrome' but I wanted Clare to be in a mainstream school.''
She said her daughter was the first Down's Syndrome child at New
Stevenson's Taylor High School and staff and fellow pupils had been
tremendously supportive.

POLICE have renewed appeals for witnesses to two of the six violent
deaths which occured in the Glasgow area last weekend.
Officers say a total of 10 people who went to the aid of Clydebank
murder victim Brian McVicar, 20, as he lay fatally injured in the town's
Alexander Street early on Sunday morning, might hold vital clues in the
hunt for those who attacked him.
Detective Chief Inspector James McEwan, who is leading the murder
hunt, said yesterday: ''A group of eight people attempted to comfort Mr
McVicar and his friend Edward Brown prior to the arrival of the
ambulance, after the two men had been attacked.
''In addition, two people passing by in a blue Ford Fiesta car also
stopped and went to the men's assistance.
''These people were with the men around 4.10am -- roughly 10 minutes
after the attack. It is possible that they hold important evidence and
we urge them, or anyone else in the area at the time, to contact us as
soon as possible. The information can be given on an anonymous basis.''
Mr McVicar, of Wood Quadrant, Clydebank, died in the Western
Infirmary, Glasgow, after the attack.
One of two friends who was with him at the time of the attack, Mr
Edward Brown, 26, of Dumbarton Road, Glasgow, sustained multiple
injuries and was detained in the same hospital.
The second friend, 16-year-old Derek Banks, of Benbow Road, Clydebank,
was not injured.
Mr McEwan described the incident as ''a totally unprovoked street
attack on a group of young men by a bunch of cowards'' and urged
witnesses to contact him at Clydebank Police Office.
Police also renewed their appeal to the public in connection with the
murder of Mr Alexander Donnelly, 29, who was fatally injured near his
home in Petershill Court, in the Springburn area of Glasgow, at about
3.05am on Sunday.
Detective Inspector David Swindle, of Baird Street Police Office, said
detectives were anxious to speak to anyone who was in the area of
numbers 10, 20, or 30 Petershill Court, or the nearby Broomfield Service
Station, between 2.45am and 3.20am on Sunday, and who may have seen or
heard anything untoward.
Six people have appeared in court in connection with three of the
violent deaths which occured in the Glasgow area last weekend.

A SUNDAY school teacher who has openly admitted to friends she is a
lesbian has been asked to finish her involvement with the church group
she loves.
Last night supporters of the teacher, Lesley Craise, 40, said she was
being hounded out of the church by homophobes .
The Kirk Session of Biggar Parish Church voted 14-13 to ask her to
finish her term of involvement with the church Sunday Club by December.
It follows behind-the-scenes rows which included the resignation of
two other Sunday school teachers and the boycott of a service on Sunday
which Ms Craise was leading.
Ms Craise, who lives with her partner Linda Hill in Biggar High
Street, has appealed to Lanarkshire Presbytery against the decision
taken by the kirk session in June.
Her supporters said last night Ms Craise was being hounded by a small
group in the church. Fellow Sunday school teacher Robin McAlpine, 22, a
journalist, said she was being victimised because she openly admitted
being a lesbian.
Mr McAlpine said there had been two other attempts to try to get her
out of the church over the past few years. He added he had no knowledge
of a protest letter supposedly circulating, signed by 40 church members,
calling for her to be banned and for the Church to enforce a General
Assembly statement that homosexual practice is against the teaching of
the Scriptures.
He said: ''Lesley is a very good teacher and a progressive thinker.
For instance, she has told children there is no reason why God has to be
seen as a man with a big, long beard. A couple of years ago she wanted
to do a play where the three wise men could be women.
''She is in a settled relationship with Linda and is well liked by the
people at the Sunday Club. She makes no secret of her sexuality, and
nobody has any problem with that.
''However, there is a small group of evangelical Christians who have
taken a dislike to her. There is no question there is a homophobic
nature to their dislike.
Mr McAlpine added: ''On Sunday, Lesley led the service and her sermon
was about tolerance and understanding.
''I believe this was too much for some of the people who just don't
like her and a call was made to a newspaper.
''This has been rumbling on for the last three years and has been
raised three times before. Our previous minister, Cameron Mackenzie, was
much more sympathetic and there was no threat to Lesley's work at the
Sunday school.
''Myself, Lesley, and another Sunday school teacher had a meeting with
parents to discuss strategies for the Sunday school and after that came
a letter asking for Lesley to resign.
''I was furious and contacted the kirk elders who told me they knew
nothing about the call for her resignation.
''She was notified about the decision to end her involvement with the
Sunday Club the day after we had met to look at the aims and objectives
of the Sunday school.
''She had no idea that decision was coming. She is a very popular
teacher and worked hard for the church and the Sunday Club.''
The Rev Iain Cunningham, clerk to Lanark Presbytery, said at Carluke
last night that the presbytery had not been involved in Ms Craise's case
as yet, and did not meet again until next month.
Ms Craise had appealed against the kirk session's decision and the
presbytery would hear the case if she decided to pursue the appeal, he
said.
The Biggar charge has been vacant since the previous minister retired.
The interim moderator, the Rev Michael Frew, was not available yesterday
and the Church of Scotland had no comment to make at its offices in
Edinburgh.
Ms Craise, who works for children's charity Barnado's in Edinburgh,
was last night unavailable for comment. But in an earlier statement she
said: ''I do not wish to say anything to split the church. I love the
church and want to see it healed and not divided.''
Mr McAlpine added: ''This has been going on for a while and the elders
at the church felt it best to ask her to leave her present post simply
to put an end to the matter.
''Lesley will continue elsewhere in the church and this group finally
got what they wanted.
''But a lot of people support her and the kids are behind her all the
way.''
Robin's father Mr Tom McAlpine, SNP councillor for Biggar on
Clydesdale district, added: ''There are many churchmen, particularly in
England, who are homosexuals and continue in their job.
''Why pick on Lesley?''

SCOTTISH Opera was in crisis last night as its appearances at the
Edinburgh Festival were put under threat following the rejection by the
chorus of a package of recommendations worked out yesterday between
management and union with the conciliation service Acas.
Industrial action will begin this morning when the 34-strong opera
chorus fails to turn up for a major rehearsal, at Glasgow's Theatre
Royal, of Dvorak's opera The Jacobin, scheduled to receive two
performances next Monday and Wednesday at the festival.
The negotiated package, which included an extra week's holiday this
year, a conditional pay rise of 2% depending on the company's financial
security at the beginning of next year, and improvements related to
conditions of service, was recommended by their union, Equity, but
rejected by the chorus.
The union emerged from Acas after eight hours of negotiations and took
the offer to the chorus at the Theatre Royal. Following intensive
discussions, the chorus held a secret ballot and voted 22-10 to reject
the package and begin industrial action this morning.
Scottish Opera management, clearly shocked by the chorus's
determination, expressed dismay. Mr Richard Jarman, general director of
Scottish Opera, said last night: ''The rejection by the chorus takes the
whole thing on to a different level. We are dismayed by the outcome,
particularly since the union itself recommended the package. We will now
have to consider our position.''
Mr Drew McFarlane, Scottish organiser of Equity, said the package had
been recommended to the chorus ''as the best deal we could get based on
a day's negotiation at Acas. I was surprised by the strength of feeling
in the chorus.
''They felt that, in terms of the non-financial aspects of the
package, the company hadn't gone far enough. And as to the pay issue,
notwithstanding the offer, they sensed no real obligation on the part of
the company to pay it. There seems to be a lack of trust.''
The offer of an extra week's holiday, said Mr McFarlane, was one where
scheduled work had already been cancelled, and therefore amounted to no
real offer. The biggest issue on the non-financial side, he said,
relates to the regular re-auditioning of the chorus every two years,
upon which their continued employment can depend.
The management offered six additional coaching sessions before
re-auditioning. The union reported that the chorus wanted a moratorium
and a freeze on the whole process of re-auditioning, which, they said,
does not happen in, for example, Covent Garden.
The package also included the offer of an annual special audition to
chorus members to allow them to audition for small individual roles in
the company's productions.
Last week, following the chorus's ballot for industrial action, they
intimated to the company a timetable for disruption. Their decision not
to turn up for work this morning begins that programme with a vengeance.
The next major target of the chorus is the dress rehearsal of The
Jacobin, scheduled to take place in the Edinburgh Festival Theatre on
Saturday.
If the company has to withdraw from the festival and cancel the
performances, it will forfeit a hefty fee, estimated to be a very high
five-figure sum.
The opera company, facing a projected deficit of #750,000 by the end
of the current financial year, had implemented a series of measures to
save money, including the cancellation of a production, and reduction in
administrative costs.
* A Prom concert by the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra at London's
Royal Albert Hall had to be abandoned last night after a serious power
failure left the venue in darkness.
The orchestra was about to perform the world premiere of a work by its
new Chinese associate composer, Tan Dun, when the lights went out. It is
thought the piece may be performed at another concert in London later
this month.

THE cast of the Gaelic soap opera Machair are threatening to walk out
of the popular series if they are not compensated for the postponement
of filming later this year.
All 18 members of the subtitled soap, which is set in Lewis, say they
will not renew their contracts unless Scottish Television, which
produced the series, or the Gaelic Television Committee (CTG), which
funded it, recompense them for loss of earnings.
Cast members are understood to have turned down alternative work
because they were told filming was resuming in September.
The actors realised they would lose out on the 10-week autumn shoot
when they were visited at Stornoway in May by STV's Alistair Moffat and
Rhoda MacDonald.
Mr Moffat said the shoot would be postponed until next spring because
of protracted funding negotiations with the CTG. The decision is costing
the actors an average of #6000 each this year.
After the visit from Mr Moffat and Ms MacDonald, the actors called in
their union, Equity, which is now pursuing the case for compensation.
Scottish organiser Drew McFarlane said yesterday: ''The cast are
adamant they won't be signing new contracts for 1996 unless they are
compensated for the loss of work this autumn. As there aren't too many
actors who speak Gaelic, that would make it impossible to continue to
make Machair.''
A spokesman for Scottish Television said STV was now in discussions
with the CTG over the compensation claim and Equity would be informed of
the outcome as soon as possible.

<HEADLINE>My life is in danger, says SAS author</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BEST-SELLING writer and SAS hero Andy McNab yesterday accused the
Ministry of Defence of endangering his life.
The author of Bravo Two Zero, about an SAS operation behind Iraqi
lines during the Gulf war, made the claim in his first interview since
the Government obtained a writ blocking publication of his latest book,
Immediate Action.
The former elite soldier, who uses McNab as a pseudonym, said he would
fight the writ and criticised the decision to issue it in his real name.
He claimed his life had now been put at risk and that he has had to
change his homes in both Britain and France.
''I think there are many principles involved . . . that go beyond the
second book which need to be fought and that's what I am going to do,''
he said.
''Because the writ has been made in my own name my wife has had to
leave our house in Hereford. We have got to move from our apartment in
France and relocate everything,'' he told Riviera Radio, an
English-speaking station broadcasting from Monaco, France.
''There is a real clear danger not only to myself -- I am big and ugly
enough to sort that out -- but I have a family to look after at the same
time which for me is more important.''
Mr McNab compared the gagging order, which the Ministry of Defence
obtained in the High Court last Wednesday, to the Government's attempts
to ban Peter Wright's book Spycatcher.
He said: ''I have not done a Peter Wright, but with the MoD's sort of
experience with this type of action, Peter Wright's book included, I
think if they went away licking their wounds then when this one comes to
court they are actually going to need plastic surgery. Because they are
wrong and I'll show that they are wrong. It has to be fought and when
you fight you fight to win.''
The MoD obtained an interim injunction from the Chancery Division of
the High Court preventing the book from being put on sale after lawyers
argued that its contents were a threat to national security.
The terms of the ruling prevents the author or his publishers,
Transworld, and their agents from discussing its contents.
''I can't say a word because I am gagged,'' the author said. ''The
only thing about the subject matter is it's gone through the same
process as Bravo Two Zero. I have always been available to talk with
them (the MoD). I am not a sort of Peter Wright II.''
Despite numerous books over the years about the SAS, some written by
former members, none had led to legal action by the MoD.
Four-times-married McNab, who is reported to lead a millionaire
lifestyle in France, shot to fame with Bravo Two Zero, which recounted
the true exploits of an eight-strong SAS patrol on an anti-Scud mission
behind Iraqi lines.
An MoD spokesman said every care had been taken to avoid using any
names.
He said: ''Having had to embark on this very unusual action, we have
sought wherever possible to avoid using the author's real name.
''But we were obliged for legal reasons to state his real name in the
court documents.
''The MoD has taken great care not to include his real name and pen
name in any public documents, but at the end of the day we have a
greater responsibility for those who are still serving in Her Majesty's
armed forces and whose lives might be put at risk by the publication of
this book,'' the spokesman added.

THE new North of Scotland Water Authority is to set up its
headquarters in Inverness, with a staff of about 80, it was announced
yesterday.
The board held its first meeting in Edinburgh, where the chairman, Mr
John Robertson, said he felt that the composition of its 12 members
offered a blend of experience and technical skills.
Despite criticism in the past of a ''quango'' set-up, he said the
board would be well equipped to take over the running of water and
sewerage services from next April.
Mr Douglas Sutherland, former managing director of Dairy Crest
Dairies, has been appointed managing director of finance. Mr James
Cockburn, currently director of water services on Grampian Regional
Council, has been appointed managing director, water services.
The new board will be responsible for two thirds of Scotland's water
services, representing more than a million customers, in which there is
an annual revenue of #113m.
Consultants are now looking at potential headquarters in Inverness,
although temporary accommodation might be sought.
Highland region's convener, Mr Duncan McPherson, said: ''I am
delighted with the prospect of 100 or so quality jobs being created in
the Highlands.''

<HEADLINE>Trust managers accused over #50m Private Finance Initiative application proposal. NHS being put in hock, says union</HEADLINE>

HOSPITAL managers were accused last night of putting the NHS in hock
after a shortlist was published of companies competing to build and
manage the replacement Hairmyres Hospital in Lanarkshire.
The #50m project is to be the subject of a Private Finance Initiative
application by a chosen consortium which would build and lease back the
532-bed hospital to the Hairmyres and Stonehouse Trust.
However, the extent to which the hospital would be managed, and staff
employed by, the successful bidders remained unclear.
A statement from the trust made clear that the trust would remain
within the NHS -- ''managing NHS doctors and nurses to look after NHS
patients'' -- but the trust was less forthcoming about the future of
other workers.
Ancillary staff like cleaners, porters, and cooks, who are already
employed by private contractors, are likely be employed by the
consortium.
The major grey area is the clinical support staff -- for example
laboratory, pharmacy, and X-ray workers, and physiotherapists and other
para-medical staff.
''I don't want to be specific about that,'' said director of
administration Douglas McKenzie. ''We are about to embark on a series of
staff meetings about manpower. We don't want to say at this stage we
will employ physiotherapists and pharmacists but not cleaners. There are
still decisions to be made but a pattern is emerging.
''We see private finance as an opportunity to get the job done more
quickly.''
Mr McKenzie said the trust had no qualms about relinquishing control
of the hospital building to a private consortium, with whatever services
went with it.
''If we have the right specification and we are monitoring closely
what is going on -- and we will have open-book access to figures --
there would be no qualms,'' he said. ''No part of the agreement allowed
for the consortium to treat private patients.
''As one trust chief executive put it recently, 'Why do we have to own
the building?' We provide health services -- that is what we know best.
We can leave the rest to others.''
The three consortia are led by Wimpey Healthcare, with a base in
Bishopbriggs; Kier Build/ISS, based in Bedfordshire; and McAlpine
Healthcare, of Hemel Hempstead.
McAlpine, which will be working with the British Linen Bank, is a
subsidiary of the construction group Sir Robert McAlpine.
The new hospital at Hairmyres is to be built on ground adjoining the
present Hairmyres.
Chief executive Alan Skirving said the trust was on target to issue a
development brief to the three consortia this month, consider the
tenders in December, and submit proposals to the NHS management
executive and the Treasury next year. It hoped to move into the new
hospital in the year 2000.
However, there was concern in Labour and trade union circles last
night about the extent to which Hairmyres could be a privately-managed
hospital. The trust chairman, Dr David Campbell, said the trust would
occupy the buildings under a renewable contract, and a payment structure
which was expected to reflect ''the use of the building as well as its
availability''.
The Private Finance Initiative has already aroused concern at
Stonehaven in Grampian, where it has been proposed that a new community
hospital should have clinical services provided by a private consortium,
and proposals for the new Edinburgh Royal Infirmary to be built through
PFI have also aroused controversy.
Labour's Scottish Health spokesman, Mr John McAllion, is to meet
Grampian Health Board representatives today to discuss the Stonehaven
situation, and will be trying to clarify the situation at Hairmyres when
he visits it in September.
''We have said we have no objection to a hospital being built and
leased back to a trust through PFI, but we draw the line at the staff
being employed by the consortium.''
Mr Mick Fuller, Scottish organiser with the laboratory workers' union
MSF, said: ''It is essential that we know what the terms of this deal
are. Hairmyres is not going to own its own assets. How is the trust
going to ensure they make enough money to pay the cost of leasing it? It
is a quantum leap down the road of privatisation. It is a much bigger
project than Stonehouse -- we are talking about a state-of-the-art
district general hospital.
''We will be demanding to know the terms of this lease.''
Mr Jim Devine, of the nursing and ancillary union Unison, called for a
moratorium on PFI deals until there had been a wide-ranging public
debate on the matter.
''We as taxpayers are not sure what we are signing up for here. We
must be told. This business of commercial confidentiality is quite
unacceptable. We certainly need to know if the consortium are employing
staff and to what extent.
''The bottom line is that these companies have to make a profit. How
is that going to be done? Some of the agreements being signed with
private companies are for 15, 20, and 25 years. They are putting the NHS
in hock to the private sector.''

A QUIP about Oban's alcohol intake by the Duke of Edinburgh raised a
few eyebrows during a royal visit to the town yesterday.
Prince Philip asked a driving instructor from the area: ''How do you
keep the natives off the booze long enough to get them past the test?''
Mr Robert Drummond and his wife Emily, from Connel, laughed off these
remarks as a joke -- as did Argyll and Bute MP Mrs Ray Michie.
However, hotelier Allan McKie, chairman of West Highlands and Islands
of Argyll Tourist Board, was more circumspect.
He said: ''I am sure he said it as a joke and I hope that people
interpret it as such. But I am disappointed that he has said it, because
the so-called natives in this part of the world are the people who have
helped to make this royal visit one of the successes of the decade for
the town and the area.''
Mr McKie said Oban was no harder a drinking town than any other in the
west coast or elsewhere in Scotland.
Prince Philip's quip came as he and the Queen went walkabout among a
crowd of 5000 at the end of the one-day visit to the town, the first by
the Queen since 1956, when it poured so hard that rain bounced off the
pavement.
Yesterday, there was warm sunshine and the crowds were swollen by
holidaymakers, prompting the Duke at one point to ask if any natives
were present in the crowd -- hence his conversation with the Drummonds.
The Queen and Duke arrived in Oban from the royal yacht Britannia,
breaking off from their annual summer cruise around the Western Isles.
People lining the coastline had hoped to catch a glimpse of Prince
Edward and his girlfriend Sophie Rhys-Jones, but they remained on board
and out of sight.
The Queen's official duties included opening the new Lorn and Islands
District General Hospital. The chairman of Argyll and Bute NHS Trust, Mr
Robert Reid, described the new hospital to the royal party as ''an
example of the type of hospital needed in a rural area''.
The royal couple met patients and members of staff before attending a
private lunch, at which the Queen and Prince Philip enjoyed some
Inverawe smoked trout and best Scottish beef.
Before their walkabout, the Queen visited an exhibition of miniature
paintings and furniture on the North Pier. Prince Philip met
participants in the Duke of Edinburgh Awards Scheme.

THE most far-reaching survey yet conducted into the lives of British
women was published yesterday, revealing that they still earn less than
men.
The Government study paints a picture of British women as well
educated and hard working. They also tend to watch four hours of
television a day, worry about their weight, and enjoy weekly quiz
magazines.
Walking is the most popular physical activity among women, closely
followed by keep-fit, yoga, and swimming.
The decline in the birth rate also means that the present population
level is set to fall, according to the Central Statistical Office.
The traditional distinction that women are homemakers while men are
breadwinners has, predictably, narrowed further.
Nearly half of all women with a child under the age of four work
part-time or full-time, in sharp contrast to a generation ago when most
women stopped working when married.
However, some things have altered little. Women still seem to do the
greater share of household chores. They still tend to make the evening
meal and do the washing, ironing, and cleaning.
Women in the 1990s are more likely to turn their hand to DIY than
knitting, tend to have fewer children than their mothers or
grandmothers, and live longer.
Since 1992, women in their early 30s are more likely to have children
than those in their early 20s and more than a fifth of women will remain
childless by the time they are 40.
Fertility rates for women aged 40 and over have soared in the past
decade. In 1983, there were 4.5 births per thousand in this age group
against 5.8 in 1993.
Nearly half of women are obese or overweight, many feel unsafe going
out alone at night in their local area, and the rising level of divorce
means that one in six mortgages are taken out by lone women.
The proportion of those living with a man instead of walking down the
aisle has nearly doubled compared with a decade or so ago. It has leapt
from 12% in 1981 to 22% in 1993/94.
Ms Carol Summerfield, editor of Social Focus on Women, admitted that
opportunities and pay for women were still not equal to those of men.
''There are improvements but there is no room for complacency and a
long way to go yet,'' she said.
Although more women are working in the 1990s, much of that rise has
been accounted for by an increase in part-time working.
The survey found that women are still under-represented in the ranks
of power, policy and decision-making, despite the advances which have
been made in recent years.
For example, only three in 10 secondary school heads and deputies were
women, even though almost half of secondary teachers are female.

THE Scottish Rugby Union, in one of the most momentous decisions in
its history, has embraced the concept of the professional player and
will go to the International Board meeting in Paris this month
determined to pay the players -- but on its own terms.
The special IRFB meeting, which has been called to confront once and
for all the issue of shamateurism and to see off the commercial
interests currently stalking the game, will seek to produce a blueprint
for the 21st century and -- certainly on the basis of the proposals to
be submitted by the SRU -- the concept of the amateur player will, very
soon, be a thing of the past.
These proposals were revealed at a mould-breaking news conference at
Murrayfield yesterday by SRU International Board representative Freddie
McLeod, who is a member of the IB's four-man amateurism working party.
Mr McLeod declared that the Scottish Rugby Union wished to see the
word ''amateur'' exorcised from the rulebook.
''In our submission to the IB we are creating a situation where we
envisage a three-tier system. There would be professionals,
semi-professionals and non-professionals. Undoubtedly, 99.99% of the top
players will come into the professional category,'' said Mr McLeod.
The SRU envisages a situation whereby its international players would
be placed under contract to the Union. These, he said, would be
introduced ''sooner rather than later''.
Mr McLeod was unable to say how much players would earn as a result of
being contracted to the Union. The figure of #35,000 a season has been
mentioned, which compares disfavourably with the #135,000 which All
Black captain Sean Fitzpatrick has said that he has been offered to sign
on with the NZRFU in the wake of the multi-million Rupert Murdoch
broadcasting deal with the Southern Hemisphere unions.
''Clearly, at this stage, I cannot say what the figure would be but,
realistically, it is likely to be nearer, say, #35,000 than #135,000,''
he said.
''We will have a graded structure. There will be a core contract for
the international squad and there will be commercial opportunities on
top of that. They would vary depending on how much off-field promotional
work the individual player wanted to do. All monies would go through a
trust fund administered by the Union, because that is the only way that
we would have any measure of control.''
Mr McLeod added that, depending on the availability of finance, the
contract system could be extended to include not only the international
squad but, perhaps, the A side as well. This would mean that as many as
50 players could be placed under contract to the Union.
To fund its payments to players the Union will have to review its
entire commercial strategy. McLeod said that the SRU would even consider
selling space on the international jersey which could be adorned with a
''tasteful'' sponsor's logo.
The price of international tickets at Murrayfield is another area
which will probably have to be looked at to cover the cost of paying the
players. This is certain to cause upset because, at the recent SRU
annual meeting, there were strenuous calls for the cost of Murrayfield
tickets to be reduced.
Mr McLeod conceded yesterday that the revolutionary nature of the
Union's proposals would cause consternation in some quarters.
''There are certain people who would be turning in their graves at
what we propose, but in sport things move on and we can't look backwards
all the time.
''The situation within the game has moved on dramatically in the last
12 months and, whether we like it or not, we are facing competition.
Murdoch is already involved in the Southern Hemisphere and, if indeed
Packer is involved, then we are being caught between two media magnates.
Many people will have reservations, but we have to continue to take the
game forward in a positive way.''

LABOUR leaders yesterday suspended the local party in Walsall and
announced an inquiry into its activities, on the same day the Tory Party
chairman arrived in town.
Dr Brian Mawhinney was there to launch an offensive against ''loony
left'' Labour-controlled councils.
As he sought to seize the initiative in a campaign against extremist
policies, Labour moved swiftly to spike his guns.
The suspension decision was taken a fortnight ago by Labour's national
executive but put into action yesterday morning (without notice, local
party activists said) by general secretary Tom Sawyer. The suspension
follows complaints about intimidation at party meetings and failure to
observe national rules.
The Shadow Environment Secretary, Mr Frank Dobson, said the suspension
had nothing to do directly with the Labour group which controls the
council.
It has been involved in controversy since it was elected in May with
proposals to set up 54 neighbourhood committees -- dubbed soviets by
critics -- to run localities. Criticism has also centred on redundancies
among heads of council departments, with more job cuts in prospect, and
plans for hippopotamus statues in the civic square.
Critics have described as ''soviet style'' the stated plans of council
leader Dave Church, a fork-lift truck driver, to give power to the
people by, for example, devolving services to neighbourhood committees.
Mr John Rothery, deputy leader of the council, said he was
''absolutely stunned '' by the suspension. He added: ''What has happened
is that we have the chairman of the Tory Party in Walsall today and I
can't believe it is a coincidence that they have decided to suspend the
Labour Party in Walsall.''
However, Mr Tony Blair has already warned Labour council leaders,
including those in Walsall, to avoid extremism.
The announcement came at the start of a series of regional tours by Dr
Mawhinney aimed at driving home the message that the way some Labour
councils are run now shows how Labour would behave in government.
He said on BBC TV: ''This panic measure shows the real difference
between 'new Labour' rhetoric and real Labour power on the streets.
''The loony left lives on in Walsall, Birmingham, Leicester, and
Nottingham. Real Labour damages the people who elected it, undermining
the services they are supposed to deliver -- indeed doing what comes
naturally to real Labour politicians.''
Labour said it was possible that members of the local party could be
suspended as a result of the investigation but there were no names in
mind. Labour councillors could be suspended but would be able to
continue serving as councillors without the party label.
At the same time, the Tories challenged Labour's devolution plans. A
Labour announcement that it would scrap 117 Welsh quangos by bringing
their functions under the control of a Welsh assembly brought a prompt
response from Welsh Secretary William Hague.
He said the move would add #100m to the burden on the taxpayer and
suggested that Labour would give Wales ''second-class status'' by
refusing it the same tax-raising powers as were proposed for the
Scottish parliament.
Conservative Central Office also scoffed at suggestions from Labour's
deputy leader, Mr John Prescott, that sponsorship of MPs by trade unions
could be ended. One possibility was that they would fund the local party
instead of the local MP.
A Labour spokesman said an inquiry would recommend the best way of
administering trade union contributions to the party. Another
suggestion, that their cash could be directed to marginal seats, is
unlikely to find favour with all unions.
A Conservative spokeswoman said: ''The first proposal is cosmetic. It
happens already and still leaves the union concerned with a great deal
of influence. Labour can't get away from the fact that they are heavily
dependent on union cash and that the unions still have a big say in
party conference decisions.''

ARGUABLY, house rental charges have been more stable in the West of
Scotland over the past decade than for buying. The experience of Brian
Watson of TACL would certainly seem to support that view.
Just 10 years ago, in addition to dealing in other aspects of letting,
he first let property in Glasgow belonging to someone else. A modern
two-bedroom furnished flat in Kelvindale went for #375, including the
local rates that applied then.
Just last week, the neighbouring and identical property was let,
refurbished but unfurnished, for #450.
''On a like for like basis,'' Brian estimates, ''I would say it offers
an increase of about 50% over the past 10 years. That's roughly in line
with inflation, and there have been similar increases in other
properties we manage.''
The same Kelvindale estate, however, had two-bedroom flats selling for
#30,000 -- and as little as #24,000 around 1985 -- with prices now
recovering to sell for between #45,000 to #47,000.
''There was this business of negative equity for a time,'' Brian
points out. ''Owners found it more sensible to let out their flats. If
you look at the overheads of selling or buying generally, it can make
good sense to rent.''
He sums up the situation. Investing in rental property is good for the
landlord as a long-term move. Typically, rents rise in line with
inflation. Appreciation usually exceeds inflation over five years or
longer periods.
''Renting for tenants is equally worthwhile in the for the short to
medium term,'' he adds. ''Compare a purchase, with legal fees, agency
costs and so on. A mortgage can change at any time, as interest rates
vary. Rent is stable.''
What, then, are typical rental prices today?
A first-floor flat in Glasgow's Merchant City, with lounge and
open-plan kitchen, double bedroom, twin bedroom, bathroom, electric
central heating and private parking, is on the cards at #550 a month.
A luxury modern flat at Lancefield Quay is slightly higher -- say,
#600 a month -- but you get to look out on the Clyde from your
south-facing conservatory extension to the lounge. There's a double
bedroom with balcony, fully-fitted kitchen, bathroom, gas-fired central
heating, garage parking.
Going for an executive flat in the Merchant City pushes things that
bit higher again. Around #700 for a first floor flat, south facing
lounge, open plan dining room, fitted kitchen, two double bedrooms,
bathroom, electric central heating, private parking.
Move out to Whitecraigs and you must expect to pay #900 a month. But
you get a semi-detached Edwardian villa. Two public rooms,
dining/kitchen, utility room and toilet downstairs. Three bedrooms, a
study or fourth bedroom and bathroom upstairs. Nice stained glass
features. Garden and garage, of course.
Out of town, there's a mid-terrace cottage in Girvan, for example.
Large lounge/dining room with patio doors, two double bedrooms, kitchen
and bathroom. Gas central heating. A snip at #300 a month.
A new four-bedroom detached villa at Langbank, on the other hand, with
its three public rooms, breakfasting kitchen, two bathrooms, extra
toilet, and double garage -- now that's more like #1200 a month. Superb
Clydeside views included gratis.

IT seems there is no end to the CALA Homes success story, with record
sales just announced for May. ''This has been our best month of the
year,'' said managing director Alan Downie. ''We have achieved over #4m
in sales across a range of sites. That's 15% up on the figure for the
equivalent month in 1994.
''Our developments at Sherbrooke Gardens, Pollokshields, and Kirklee
in Glasgow are attracting excellent visitor levels and sales.''
And in the East of Scotland CALA sold 10 detached properties in
advance of the recent launch of two new showhouses at its prime site in
Linlithgow.
Back in the west, delighted buyers at CALA's latest exclusive
residential development, at Bishopbriggs, which enjoys excellent rail
and road access into Glasgow city centre, have begun to move in and can
now fully appreciate the company's commitment to quality in design and
finish -- recognised officially last year when CALA became the first
housebuilder in Scotland to be awarded the ISO/9001.
Within Waterside Gardens there are 56 properties and the eight
different house styles provide a fine variety of architectural features,
adding further to the uniqueness of the project.
''Fifteen houses are now occupied, which is good news,'' said Isobel
Watt, sales and marketing manager.
''There has been a good response; we have already secured over #3m in
sales and there are options from prospective purchasers worth a further
#1.5m.''
CALA releases its new houses well in advance to give people time to
sell their existing properties and the company offers part exchange on
selected properties.
Waterside Gardens -- situated across the revitalised Forth and Clyde
canal from Cawder Golf Course, with access from Cadder Road, immediately
opposite Strathkelvin Retail Park -- is a development of four and
five-bedroom detached houses and four-bedroom bungalows with prices from
#159,000.
The Linslade show home, with eye-catching interior design by Laura
Gill of Inspired Interiors, is a classic family home boasting four
bedrooms and an open plan-style ground floor comprising family room,
kitchen, breakfasting area, lounge, and dining room. An integral double
garage completes the accommodation.
''The kitchen, breakfasting area, and TV/family room are designed so
that if you are working in the kitchen, the kids are not shut away from
you,'' said Isobel.
Kitchens feature quality European units, and all appliances --
integrated double oven, gas or electric hob, extractor cooker hood,
integrated fridge/freezer and dishwasher -- are standard.
Wall tiling is provided above worktops and, like the bathrooms, there
is a extensive selection of attractive quality tiles made by Porcelanosa
Ceramics of Spain. In the bathroom and ensuite there is also a choice of
fitted bathroom furniture and sanitaryware in all the latest colours and
styles. Tiling is provided to dado height in bathrooms and shower rooms
and full-height tiling is provided in shower cubicles. Shower screens
are standard in all ensuite shower enclosures, and shaver points add the
final touch.
But the secret of CALA's success is not solely due to the sumptuously
appointed interiors of its homes.
''We pay a lot of attention to the exterior finish of the properties
to create an attractive street scene and give each home an individual
feel,'' said Isobel.
''So both the exteriors and interiors are unique and you can stamp
your own individuality with your choice of colours and finishes.
''We also pay attention to the landscaping to try to create an
attractive environment on the development as well. All the houses have
double garages so there are no parking problems.''
Homes at Waterside Gardens enjoy the sort of high specification buyers
have come to expect from CALA, including double glazing, patio doors (in
most homes) to the rear garden; mirrored sliding wardrobe doors with
brass frames in the master bedrooms; ensuite; coving in the lounge,
dining room, downstairs hall and master bedroom; and mahogany-look
spindled ballustrades and stringers on stairs.
Both heating and hot water are supplied via efficient gas-fired boiler
radiators. The system, with a two-year warranty, is easily regulated by
a modern control panel and all homes are ''Gas Warm'' under the
requirements of British Gas.
So by combining amenity with accessibility, Waterside Gardens is one
of those rare residential developments that recognise the recreational
and practical needs of the family.
Other developments are Eagle Rise at Dullater, near Cumbernauld, which
offers three, four, and five-bedroom detached houses and bungalows from
#125,000; Sherbrooke Gardens, Pollokshields, which offers five-bedroomed
detached houses from #215,000; Auchenbothie, Kilmacolm, where there are
15 large four and five-bedroom detached houses from #166,000, and 10
luxury apartments in the converted B-listed Auchenbothie mansion, with
prices between #58,000 and #155,000; and Kirklee Wynd, Kelvinside, which
offers two and three-bedroom apartments from #94,000.

HERE is a nest for wealthy birdwatchers. Old Montrose is an imposing
mansion house situated at the head of the Montrose Basin, a wildlife
reserve famous for its waterfowl -- and the flocks of ornithologists who
visit the area all year round.
The property is about 3.5 miles from the pleasant seaside town of
Montrose, which has historic trade associations with the Baltic. When he
visited the town on his tour of Scotland, Dr Johnson pronounced it,
''well built, airy and clean''.
The site of the house itself also has ancient historical connections.
In 1972 Nigel Tranter, prolific writer of novels and guides to
Scotland's castles and mansions, wrote in The Queen's Scotland: The
Eastern Counties (Hodder &amp; Stoughton Ltd): ''Old Montrose is a misnomer.
It should be Alt Moine Ros, meaning the promontory of the burn in the
moss. Sir David the Graham, a supporter of Bruce, was granted these
lands in 1325, in exchange for those of Cardross, on the Clyde estuary .
. .
''The 3rd Lord Graham was created Earl of Montrose in 1505. There is
some doubt as to whether the 5th Earl, the great James Graham, later 1st
Marquis, was born here, or at the town house of the family in near by
Montrose, in 1612. At his downfall and execution, the lands went to his
enemy and former lieutenant, the notorious 1st Earl of Middleton.''
According to the selling agents, Old Montrose is a misnomer in more
ways than one. The original mansion house is said to have been
demolished around 1840, traces of it remaining in the walls of some of
the outbuildings. The date of the present house in uncertain but almost
certainly dates back from the 1840's. The scale of the establishment in
its heyday is evidenced in the stable block and the former walled
garden.
Old Montrose is situated amongst rolling, fertile farmland close to
the Montrose basin, with fine views to the Grampian Mountains to the
north. It is one of a number of fine houses in the area surrounding the
Basin, the most notable of them being House of Dun, now in the care of
the National Trust for Scotland.
The house has a pleasant setting in its own grounds of about 10.5
acres which include the former walled gardens, stable block and two
cottages. The accommodation comprises: drawing room, dining room,
sitting room, office, eight bedrooms, two dressing rooms, bathrooms,
shower room, two cloakrooms, kitchen, pantry and laundry.
Should you wish to wing your way up there, the property is offered for
sale in up to 5 lots, with a guide price for the whole of offers over
#300,000 from Savills' Brechin office.

A MAJOR Scottish builder believes that it has found a silver lining in
the Edinburgh market.
CALA Homes has released details of its newest development at
Silvermills, in the Stockbridge area of Edinburgh.
The 90 apartments, described by CALA as ''ideal for the young
professional and those in the upper age bracket,'' are located in West
Silvermills Lane, off Henderson Row.
Silvermills was the name of a hamlet (now part of Stockbridge) where a
mill for smelting and refining silver was set up early in the 17th
century to process the silver from the Earl of Haddington's mine near
Linlithgow.
The apartments have a high specification, with quality kitchens
equipped with oven, hob, waste disposal and washer dryer, tiled
bathrooms and showers. Double glazing and central heating are standard
throughout. There is a choice of nine designs. Ample parking will be
provided, and there is even a bicycle shed.
''The development has been designed in traditional style to blend with
the existing buildings in the area. The external appearance will be
interesting. We have used a variety of reconstituted stone, render,
facing brick, and slate roofs,'' says Gill Gray, CALA's sales and
marketing manager.
Prices at Silvermills start at #65,000.

A NEW Scottish building firm has won a national award for the very
first home to be completed since the company was set up a year ago. Alan
Grant (Grampian) Ltd received the accolade for a home designed and built
to a client's own specification.
The national Homebuilder Design Awards is an annual event judged by a
panel of property and environmental experts. Placed sixth in the top 10,
managing director Alan Grant said: ''I am delighted to be receiving this
national award, especially since it was the first home to be completed
in the first 12 months of launching Alan Grant (Grampian) Ltd. Although
we are a new company we have years of experience in the construction
industry.''
The award-winning design consists of, lounge, family room, kitchen,
conservatory, five bedrooms (one with en-suite) and came complete with a
granny flat which has a sitting room, bedroom with en-suite bathroom,
kitchen and conservatory. It was built using a timber-frame structure
and included the Scotwarm package giving extra energy saving and lower
fuel bills.
Launched in August 1994 Alan Grant (Grampian) Ltd was set up to
provide a flexible service offering homes designed ''to reflect the
lifestyle an ideals of our buyers''.
ANYONE wanting to live in the uplands close to the lowlands should
look Downhill over. A small estate on the south side of the Ochils,
Downhill is in Glendevon and comprises a period country house, a let
hill farm, hill grazings and a village house. The estate totals about
540 acres and is for sale by private treaty as a whole or in four lots.
Bruce Osborne of selling agents Bidwells says: ''This is a small
residential estate in a beautiful location on the south side of the
Ochil Hills, yet within easy reach of the Central Belt.
''Downhill House itself is superbly located, flanked by hills and
overlooking Castlehill Reservoir. It is only two miles from the A91,
giving easy access to Edinburgh, Perth, Stirling, and Glasgow.''
Downhill House was built in 1902 in brick and stone with traditional
harling under a slate roof. Used as a holiday home in recent years, the
house is in need of some improvement, but offers the opportunity of
establishing a permanent home in a pleasant rural setting. The grounds
include a garden with shrubs, about five acres of woodland, and further
land running down to the confluence of the Glendoy Burn with the River
Devon.
As well as the hill farm and grazings, the estate also includes
Torville House in Glendevon village -- a 19th-century house ripe for
refurbishment.
Bidwells of Perth is seeking offers offers over #300,000 for the whole
estate, although it may be broken up into smaller lots.

A NEW trend in house buying is reported by Mark Adams of G&amp;S
Properties. He says parents now not only take the children with them
when viewing property, but they actively seek their opinion on the
prospective new family home.
G&amp;S Properties, with offices in Bearsden and the West End, this week
announces sales for the second quarter up by 36% over last year's
figures. Mark Adams, who became a partner three months ago, puts the
increase down to more sales and not higher prices.
''We have given G&amp;S a new, strong structure and have brought in a
number of highly motivated sales staff,'' he says. ''We are finding a
lot of activity in Bearsden and Milngavie, particularly at the top end
of the market. The bigger properties in the #185,000-plus range are now
moving, whereas only two months ago they were sticking. The holiday
season is having little effect on sales this year.
''Many of the people looking to buy in Bearsden and Milngavie are
moving out of the West End -- often because they want to start a family,
away from the hubble bubble of the city.''
Mark, who is 24, is not yet in the business of having a family, but he
is in a family business.

RECENT Government figures grossly exaggerated the level of negative
equity in Scotland. At the end of June the households affected by
negative equity had shot up from 8,520 to 53,000 during the second
quarter of this year.
Not surprisingly, this apparent earthquake was greeted with scepticism
by property professionals who felt that, although the market is still
sticky and patchy, there are no signs that it is being undermined by
negative equity.
After a flood of demands to back up its figures, the DoE has said that
its quarterly report is a ''number-crunching exercise'' rather than a
survey based on market realities and has promised to review both the
methodology and interpretation of its own statistics.
While Scotland has not been immune to negative equity, there is no
evidence that it is an important factor in holding back the market.
The Scottish victims are mainly those who bought their homes this year
only to see values dip slightly during the May to July period. That's
not a pleasant experience, but not many people who bought during that
time are likely to sell their homes in the immediate future.
The Nationwide Building Society estimates that a one per cent increase
in house prices would wipe out 90% of Scotland's negative equity. The
society says that some 1.5 million households in the UK are caught in
the negative equity trap with a total debt of #7.5 billion (an average
of some #5000 per affected household, and even higher in the south of
England).
But after going back to his computer to produce Scottish figures for
The Herald, Nationwide's group research controller Paul Sanderson said:
''There are three key differences between Scotland and the south of
England. Firstly, the number of households affected by negative equity
in Scotland is very small. Those households which are affected have a
very low level of negative equity -- I'd estimate an average of less
than #500 -- Scotland has a total of something like #8m of negative
equity compared with a UK total of #7.5 billion, now that's tiny!
Lastly, negative equity in Scotland is very recent compared with parts
of England where the problem has been much more long term. Such a
short-term, low-average phenomenon should not cause a housing market
mobility problem in Scotland.''
While other parts of the UK have seen frightening collapses in house
values, according to Nationwide's statistics Scotland has seen a gradual
rise throughout the last five years -- although the upward trend has
flattened out recently.
The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) did its own
research and issued a rebuff to the DoE's alarmist negative equity
statistics: ''Despite figures issued recently by the Department of the
Environment which suggested a massive increase in the problem in
Scotland, the market has never suffered the catastrophic decline
observed in the south East of England,'' said the RICS.
''I've never seen a deal fall through because of someone finding
themselves in negative equity. It's simply not part of my experience in
Scotland,'' says John Guidi of Buckingham Estate Agents. ''It's true
that some parts of the market are doing better than others, but Scotland
has not seen the free-fall that the south of England's market witnessed
a few years ago. Scots were too canny -- we did not over-borrow during
the 1980s. Borrowers, lenders, estate agents, and lawyers -- we all
played our part in not getting carried away by London's boom so we have
not seen the collapse in prices that they have seen, with all of the
negative equity that follows.''
But John Guidi feels that the Government could do much more for the
property sector, even if the contribution consists only of not issuing
daft statistics. ''I heard the DoE figures on the car radio. I simply
did not believe that Scotland's negative equity had multiplied in three
short months, but I said to myself, 'Nice one, another nail in our
coffin' ''
Estate agent Roy Slater takes a similar view. While conceding that
there is negative equity in Scotland, he says: ''In reality, the only
factual case of negative equity that an estate agent meets is the person
who takes a loss on their current house to buy another one. And there
are not many of those.''
Pointing out that his valuers visit up to 500 homes per month, he
concedes that about half of those visited will decide not to move. ''But
even at the peak of the boom something like 30% or 40% would decide not
to move, because they still had to find the cash for something else. My
gut feeling is that The Nationwide has got it about right -- there is
negative equity in Scotland, but it is not significant enough to hold
the market back.
''It's the Government's volte face on property since the last election
which has shattered the hopes of recent first-time buyers.''
Howevere, Roy Slater predicts that things will get better for the
property market in the run up to the next election: ''The Government is
poised to start bribing us. There's a proverb that we should 'beware of
Greeks bearing gifts' -- frankly, the Government has messed property up
so badly that I'm ready to roll the red carpet out for any Greek, or
politician, who comes bearing gifts in the next 12 months.''

GOLDEN oldies are usually the preserve of ageing disc jockeys who
treasure hits from the 1960s. Not so valued is the interior decor of the
time with its emphasis on purple walls, black ceilings, and flower-power
doors and floors.
Amazingly, some of the kitsch has survived into the kitchens and
living rooms of the 1990s -- and the effect is usually grim. When
Duncairn was purchased a year ago, the buyer's first job was to strip
out the 1960s interior which cast a gloom throughout the house.
But every cloud has a silver lining, when she removed the ceiling
tiles from the dining room she discovered fragments of the former
cornice and central rose. Highly delighted, she set to work to take
mouldings of the plasterwork and has restored the ceilings to their
former glory -- creating a graceful period effect through the careful
use of gold and silver paint.
''The owner has done a marvellous restoration job -- and she carried
out most of the work herself. It's not often that you see someone
completely restore a traditional interior. I was in the house last week
in that glorious sunshine and you should have seen the ceiling twinkle.
The kitchen is magnificent with stone floors and granite surfaces. But
now she has to go back to the USA and is having to sell,'' says Gerry
Scobie of estate agents Roy Slater.
The house is a detached sandstone villa on a corner site on Sherbrooke
Avenue in Pollokshields. The accommodation comprises: three public
rooms, a study, four bedrooms and an extensive basement. Roy Slater is
looking for offers over #395,000.
