BICKERING over lack of money, more doping bans, tabloid open season on
Linford Christie -- it must be time for the World Athletics
Championships.
With the opening ceremony taking place tomorrow in Sweden, UK athletes
are angry over proposed pay cuts which seem certain to prolong the
sport's controversial summer.
Apart from the elite, the bulk of Britain's athletes are being asked
by the British Athletics Federation to sign contracts which will
significantly reduce their income.
A sliding scale ranging from #100 to #800 is proposed for every event.
But with British and national records having to be broken to qualify for
some of the #800 payments, the athletes are ripe for revolt.
Some are threatening to boycott UK meetings, echoing Christie's
refusal to race in Britain earlier this season in protest against what
he had been offered by BAF.
''If Christie can strike when he is offered #25,000 per race, lesser
mortals can certainly take action over a paltry offer like this,'' said
one internationalist.
The standards set by BAF are exemplified by the men's 100m. An athlete
running 10.35sec will earn #100. To qualify for an #800 payment he would
have to clock 10.00. Christie is the only UK sprinter ever to have run
as fast.
No British man has ever achieved the #800 standard sought in the pole
vault (5.80m) or discus (66.00m), and the long jump requirement at 8.25m
is two centimetres further than Lynn Davies' 27-year-old UK best. In
some events, no UK athlete has proved capable even of matching the #100
performance this season.
''How will this encourage field eventers, in which we are very weak?''
was the predictable question.
In the women's 100m, 100m hurdles, high jump, pole vault, triple jump,
shot, and hammer, the #800 mark is superior to the existing UK record,
which will inevitably be interpreted as discrimination against the
women.
Not even Christie has attained the #800 standard in the 100m this
year.
Malcolm Arnold, the BAF director of coaching and development, said.
''You must not over-simplify this. Leading competitors will be able to
negotiate higher fees. There is additional money for European,
Commonwealth and AAA champions (understood to be $500, $200, and $200
respectively).''
There is also prize money of $4000 for winning a full grand prix
event, and $2500 for victory at a second tier meeting.
''These payments are what the sport in Britain can afford to pay.
Everyone will know where they stand, unlike in the past, when if the
paymaster liked your face, you might get more, and if he didn't you
would get less.''
Arnold insists that too many athletes consider themselves full-time
professionals, yet cannot make a living.
''This is the lesser of two evils. It is better for a young athlete to
know he will get #800 for running 10.00 dead than thinking he is going
to get #25,000 like Linford Christie.
''In practice, if people run the $800 perfromances, they will win
championship medals, and will then be negotiating their own fees.''
Christie, as has happened on the eve of previous major championships,
was again the victim of ''terror tabloid'' intrusion yesterday, which
ended last night with his agent Sue Barrett, confirming that Christie is
indeed a grandfather at the age of 35.
If past experience is any guide, this is the last piece in the jigsaw
which will ensure Christie's success in the 100m final on Sunday.
The Olympic and defending world sprint champion, true to previous
form, has been railing against the media for weeks. Final confirmation
that the championships must be about to start came with notification
yesterday from the International Amateur Athletic Federation that two
athletes, Jamaican David Powell, and Nigerian Daniel Effiong, have
failed dope tests, and are suspended. Both would have been serious
rivals to Christie.
Powell, edged into second by Christie over 100m in Oslo last month,
has tested positive for both the steroid methyltestosterone, and the
stimulant, ephedrine. Commonwealth 200m bronze medallist Effiong had
traces of ephedrine in his urine.

WHAT should have been the happiest days in the history of Falkirk
Football Club have become something of a nightmare for the Brockville
side, according to chairman George Fulston as he pondered last night the
effect of manager Jim Jefferies' decision to join Hearts.
And Jefferies broke his silence about the ''crazy 25-minute period''
in which he decided to change his mind and move to Tynecastle after five
years in the manager's chair at Falkirk.
On Tuesday, Fulston had been told that Falkirk District Council had
given the go-ahead for the club to build a new stadium. ''The past 48
hours have been largely taken up by that,'' said the chairman. ''And we
are now waiting for a feedback from the Secretary of State for Scotland.
I also have to earn a living and tend to my business. As well as
football, I've got forklift trucks to think about.
''Managers come and managers go, but a new stadium will stand for 100
years. Now, however, we can turn our attention to the Jim Jefferies
situation, and the bottom line is that if Hearts do not come up with the
necessary compensation, it is a stand-off and Jim Jefferies is staying
here.''
Fulston, who cancelled a holiday to Torquay and Jersey which was to
have begun yesterday -- ''when I got home last night my understanding
wife had already unpacked the cases'' -- also revealed that his manager
had virtually been suspended.
He said: ''We have sent Jim a letter by recorded delivery, advising
him that he is on leave of absence. He has a contract which says he will
be employed with us for the next year, but there is nothing to stop us
appointing a technical director, or call it what you want, to oversee
football matters at Brockville while he is on leave of absence.
''And if he decides to resign, then we don't have to accept it. There
are some people who think I should be doing backward somersaults to
accomodate other people, but this is not a problem of my making.''
As we talked, a fax message arrived at Brockville from Hearts, asking
for a meeting today, and Fulston said: ''Good. I am now about to sit
down with my directors to discuss this matter for the first time. We
will have a quiet meeting and we will hope to decide on adequate
compensation.
''If we come to an agreement, then I will be happy to meet Hearts
chairman Jim Robinson, even for breakfast. But, as I said, if they don't
meet our valuation in terms of compensation, then it's a stand off.''
Last Saturday, Jefferies announced that he was staying at Falkirk and
would be signing a new seven-year contract, but, just 48 hours later, it
was confirmed he was joining Hearts.
Jefferies described how, when in talks with Falkirk chairman George
Fulston on Saturday, he had a change of heart.
''I had a great relationship with George, but he is a very difficult
man to turn down once he gets started,'' he said in a local newspaper.
''He became very distraught and it was all very emotional. It was then
that it crossed my mind that everything I had built up at the club was
going to collapse.
''So I told George I was going to stay. But I knew it was not the
right decision when we stood on the step at Brockville and announced
what was happening to the fans.''
Jefferies said that the lure of managing Hearts -- the club he had
supported as a boy -- was too great to ignore.
He said: ''It was a life's ambition of mine to become manager of
Hearts. My father is a Hearts supporter, I had stood on the terracing as
a boy before playing for the club, and now my son Jason is a Hearts fan.
''I always hoped I would get the chance to manage Hearts one day and
it was a dream come true when that opportunity came along.
''There are a lot of good players at Tynecastle and, hopefully, they
will respond positively to Billy Brown and myself arriving at the club.
''If they knuckle down and get on with the job, there might not be a
need to bring too many new faces to the club, but it might be a good
thing to bring in some freshness.''
Jefferies' first match will be in a pre-season friendly against Derby
at the Baseball Ground on Saturday.
Back to Brockville, and as things stand, speculation already is going
the rounds as to who will be the replacement should the Jefferies battle
end with himself and Brown moving to Tynecastle.
Jefferies was certainly not holding the reins at Hearts when they
played a closed-door match at Dunfermline yesterday. The man was nowhere
to be seen. Eamonn Bannon was in charge as Hearts went down 3-1 at East
End Park.
''When I got home
last night, my
understanding wife
had already unpacked
the cases''

Clyde 0, Rangers 4
MARK Hateley last night handed out a European Cup goalscoring warning
as he collected an outstanding hat trick in this friendly at Broadwood.
With all eyes on Paul Gascoigne, it was Hateley and Brian Laudrup who
served up a feast for the Ibrox support. Seconds from the end, Rangers
fans were left worrying again about Ally McCoist. However, despite
having felt a slight strain in a thigh, he should be fit to face Dundee
United tomorrow night.
The striker who had come on after the interval and hit a post in the
later stages, signalled to the side with only 30 seconds to go that he
wanted to come off.
The Rangers manager Walter Smith is looking for goals in the first leg
European cup-tie next week agaisnt Famagusta, and the top scoring
Hateley showed that he is in the mood.
With Gascoigne showing some neat touches, but quiet for long spells,
the spotlight fell on Danish international Laudrup.
The opening goal came after 17 minutes. Laudrup's through ball was
perfect and Hateley scored with a left-foot shot.
Although Hateley missed from under the crossbar eight minutes later,
that did not deter the striker and five minutes from the interval he
collected his second from yet another Laudrup cross.
The second division side tried hard and Martin O'Neil had a dangerous
shot dealt with by keeper Billy Thomson, who is aiming for that back-up
spot to Andy Goram.
And shortly before the interval, the Hateley-Laudrup combination
struck again for the striker to collect his hat trick with a header.
With the irrepressible Mccoist taking over after the interval from
Laudrup, Gascoigne obviously decided that he would take on the dual role
of provider and scorer. And after 52 minutes, he added the fourth with a
solo goal.
Rangers keeper Billy Thomson had a fright after that when his
attempted clearance cannonned off the onrushing Gordon Parks, and the
ball slipped past a post.
And then manager Walter Smith, not surprisingly, decided that with the
heat of this Scottish night, he should not subject Gascoigne to a full
90 minutes, and 19 minutes from time he received a standing ovation as
he was replaced by Ian Durrant.
CLYDE -- Hillcoat, Watson, Angus, Ferguson, Knox, Brown, O'Neil,
Gillies, Annand, Harrison, Patterson. Substitutes -- Parks, Prunty,
McConnell, Nisbet, Dickson, McCarron, McQueen.
RANGERS -- Thomson, Wright, Robertson, Gough, McLaren, Reid, McCall,
Gascoigne, Miller, Hateley, Laudrup. Substitutes -- Cleland, Durrant,
Rae, McCoist, Ferguson, Steven, Durie.
Referee -- R Tait (East Kilbride).

OPEN champion John Daly is sporting a new look at the Scandinavian
Masters in Malmo this week. He is now a skinhead and says: ''My wife
Paulette just laughed. If she gives me any slack about it I'll shave off
her hair too.''
Daly shaved his head this week because he ''got bored''. The man
dubbed ''Wild Thing'' added: ''Some people said my hair was too short
and others said it was too long so I thought 'to hell with it, take the
lot off.' ''
He explained he was now a member of a three-man club: ''One of my
buddies, Blake Allison back in Arkansas, had a bet with me earlier this
year that if I won a tournament anywhere in the world he would shave his
head. I guess he's a real baldie now.
''Then my manager, Bud Martin, was celebrating Scott Hoch's victory at
the Dutch Open last Sunday, got a bit tipsy, and we persuaded him to
shave his hair off as well.''
Daly is playing his last European tournament before returning for the
US PGA championship at the Riviera Club, Los Angeles, next week.
And he also has agreed to play in the World Series of Golf in Akron
later this month, from August 24-27.
Daly is particularly keen to do well in the US PGA as he still hopes
to make the American Ryder Cup team. ''I think if I finish fifth at the
Riviera I have a chance of getting into the top 10 in the points
table,'' he said.
This week could be Daly's last appearance in Europe this year. ''I
will not make either the World Matchplay or Dunhill Cup this year,'' he
said. ''I'm already committed to other events.''

MECHANICAL raspberry harvesters are becoming an increasingly common
sight on Tayside fruit farms, but, according to Andy Pillow, chairman of
Scottish Soft Fruit Growers Limited, there will always be a place for
hand-pickers for the higher quality grades of fruit.
The new breed of mechanical harvester, specially adapted to cope with
the Scottish terrain, is helping farmers overcome the problem of finding
sufficient numbers of people willing to take on the arduous task of
hand-picking.
The mechanical pickers can cost up to #85,000 each and about 30
farmers have purchased their own equipment with European funding
accessed through Scottish Enterprise Tayside.
Soft fruit remains an important part of the Tayside economy. With
around 5000 tonnes of fruit produced each year the industry's annual
turnover exceeds #6m.

THE recent spell of good weather -- with last month going on record as
one of the hottest July's this century -- has prompted a series of
warnings of problems for farmers, arising directly from exceptionally
high temperatures.
Jack Lawson, managing director of Scottish Livestock Services,
Scotland's largest cattle-breeding company, forecasts difficult calvings
over the next three months.
''Due to the well-above-average grazing conditions many dry cows and
in-calf heifers are now over-fat and this is certainly leading to
difficult calvings,'' he said.
''I have noted many pregnant animals on a diet of luscious, which is
really not good for them. Farmers should take immediate steps to ration
food intake either by placing them on barer pastures or bringing them
indoors.
''We know from calving reports made through our cattle-breeding and
milk-recording departments that in normal circumstances the autumn
months present more difficulties. Early reports this year indicate that
the problem will be worse than usual unless the recommended steps are
taken.''
In the arable sector, which is looking forward to a bumper harvest,
soaring temperatures could lead to problems unless grain storage is
managed correctly, warns Charles Bolton of Dalgety Agriculture.
In particular, he singles out the possibility of growers losing out on
quality malting barley premiums unless extra vigilance is shown before
putting grain into store.
''There has been a significant rise in the temperature of ex-combined
barley since harvesting started,'' he said. ''Unless this is reduced
before going into store, rectifying the problem later on becomes
ineffective and very costly.
''If grain enters a store without being cooled sufficiently it will
start to sweat, eventually culminating in hot spots. Unless detected
early, these warm and moist areas will encourage germination and reduce
grain quality. Farmers should not underestimate the potential problems
associated with storing all grain types.''
In particular, he warned of the possible financial implications for
barley growers. The loss of premium resulting from a reduction between
malt quality and feed quality could be as much as #50 a tonne.
Dalgety's advice is to ensure that grain enters the store in the best
possible condition. Warm grain should be cooled as quickly as possible
after combining.
Heat stress, caused by a combination of soaring temperatures and high
humidity, is reported to be having a severe effect on the productivity
of UK poultry units. Paddy Fagan, poultry specialist with ICI Nutrition,
has advised producers to increase the quantity of sodium bicarbonate in
the diet.
''Extremely hot weather has a significant effect on profitability,
knocking growth rates in broilers and reducing egg shell quality in
layers,'' he said. ''Welfare is an additional concern in broiler units
where acute heat stress is experienced. Unless swift action is taken,
bird mortality rates will rise.''
Recent Australian research suggests that supplementation of broiler
diets with sodium bicarbonate can improve food intake and growth rate
when temperatures are high. This supports ICI's own work in Shropshire
which revealed a 6% reduction in heat stress mortality rates when
additional bicarbonate was supplied.

MODERN farming methods are posing a big threat to the future of some
of Britain's best-loved birds, according to a new report.
It is becoming clear that farmland bird populations are in severe
decline, says the report by the British Trust for Ornithology.
The populations of ten species -- the tree sparrow, grey partridge,
turtle dove, bullfinch, spotted flycatcher, song thrush, lapwing,
skylark, reed bunting and linnet -- have more than halved since 1970,
according to the trust.
Most threatened is the tree sparrow, whose numbers have declined by
89%, the grey partridge, down 82%, and the turtle dove, down 77%.
Some other species, common on farmland a few decades ago, are now so
rare that there are no longer enough of them for researchers to survey.
They include the corncrake, snipe, yellow wagtail, cirl bunting and corn
bunting.
And the red-backed shrike is now extinct as a regular breeding
species, adds the report.
''The situation is becoming desperate, with some three million fewer
breeding skylarks singing in the British countryside,'' said BTO
director Jeremy Greenwood.
''The overall explanation is easy to see, namely the intensification
of farming. But the exact reasons, as they affect each species, are much
more difficult to disentangle.''
The trust is launching an appeal to help pay for research into
specific reasons for the decline and to find ways of boosting numbers
again.
But the report says the picture is not completely black for Britain's
birds. The populations of 15 species -- including the mallard, cuckoo
and chaffinch -- have increased by more than a quarter in the last 25
years, it adds.

THE Scottish Landowners' Federation and the Timber Growers'
Association have formed a joint liaison committee to consider Scottish
aspects of UK forestry policy, writes ROBERT ROSS.
Graeme Gordon, federation convener, said the committee would take up a
number of issues including the need to improve the overall image of
forestry in Scotland. It would also press for a grant structure which
provided for a long-term management and felling programme and address
the problem of increasing restrictions being placed on timber traffic on
rural roads.
''We look forward to working with the Timber Growers' Association to
the benefit of all involved in forestry in Scotland, as well as
improving the public perception of the industry and highlighting its
importance to the Scottish rural economy,'' said Mr Gordon.
Mark Crichton Maitland, chairman of the TGA, said: ''I am committed to
working towards a broad consensus with out natural allies. One has only
to look at issues such as agricultural tenancies in England and Wales --
or planting on set-aside -- to see what can be achieved when there is
consensus.
''Our first formal liaison meeting with SLF provided a firm basis for
us to move forward together in Scotland. Similar meetings with the
Country Landowners' Association in England and Wales have also proved
fruitful.
''I am sure this is the best way forward for all of us.''
* CSC Crop Protection, in association with the TGA, is to stage the
Scottish Forestry Conference and Exhibition at the MacRobert Pavilion,
Ingliston, in October.
The keynote speech will be given by the Professor of Forestry at
Aberdeen University, Hugh Miller.

OLIVER McCall is to be called before the British Boxing Board of
Control following his vow to inflict serious damage on Frank Bruno.
The World Boxing Council heavyweight champion, who defends his title
against Bruno at Wembley Stadium on September 2, said at his initial
news conference: ''I will take him out and try to do what he done to my
friend, it's as simple as that.''
McCall was referring to Gerald McClellan, who was seriously injured
during his WBC super-middleweight title clash with Nigel Benn five
months ago. The wave of adverse publicity has prompted the Board to act.
''We have to licence McCall to fight here and therefore he is amenable
to the Board's rules and regulations,'' said vice-chairman Leonard
'Nipper' Read. ''He will face the Board's disciplinary committee.''
It seems McCall could face a hefty fine or a reprimand for his
insensitive statement.
McCall did not actually apologise for his threat when he sat a couple
of feet away from Bruno yesterday. But to prove there were no hard
feelings, Bruno playfully offered to bet McCall his designer wristwatch
as a bet on the fight.
McCall said: ''I do not want to talk about Gerald McClellan and my
feelings on the situation. I do not blame Frank or Nigel Benn.
''It's not true I want Bruno to be a vegetable. Frank and I have
sparred together and he's a nice guy, a very gracious person and you do
not forget things like that.''
Bruno confessed he had not read the controversial reports in the
newspapers. But he stressed: ''I do not give a monkey's what he said
about vegetables, it's all hype. If he wants to say things like that he
will need more minders than he's got now.''
It will be Bruno's fourth attempt to claim the ultimate prize having
been stopped in his three previous title attempts against Tim
Witherspoon, Mike Tyson and Lennox Lewis.

HIS rivals have labelled pole vaulter Okkert Brits ''The Animal.'' His
female colleagues on the South African team refer to him as ''The
Body.'' Others call him downright crazy.
Possibly the last group are correct. When his coach, Joop Loots,
visited him at his seventh-storey appartment in Nice last year, he found
Brits outside . . . clinging by just four fingers from the window ledge.
Brits shouted for help, pretending he could not get back in, though he
knew he was capable of hauling himself over the sill. He acknowledges it
was as much a stunt to wind up Loots as anything else.
''A lot of things that give people adrenaline don't give me
adrenaline,'' he offered by way of explanation. ''It gave me a real
kick.''
Exploring what produces an adrenaline surge may seem a natural piece
of research for a world-class athlete, though Brits concedes:
''Sometimes I think I must be mad.'' This seems to be confirmed when he
reveals he also gets a buzz from bungee-jumping or surfing in
shark-infested water.
Adrenaline is what helps supercharge those in pursuit of superhuman
performance, and Brits will need such a effort if he is to depose Sergei
Bubka, the world's most consistent athlete, when their event gets under
way a week tomorrow at the World Athletics Championships in Gothenburg.
Bubka has won the world pole vault title every year since the
inaugural event in 1983 -- topping the podium in Helsinki, Rome, Tokyo,
and Stuttgart -- a monopoly enjoyed by no other athlete, male or female,
in any single event, though sprinter/long jumper Carl Lewis has more
world titles.
The Ukrainian has 35 world records to his credit, indoor and out, and
is a millionaire by virtue of having nudged the record upwards a cannily
economic single centimetre at a time -- at least one record per year,
for 10 years, since 1984. He has topped six metres 40 times in his
career.
But his supremacy may be coming to an end. For the first time in 11
years, there has been no world record this year and Sestriere last
weekend was the first time he had reached 6m this season.
In Monte Carlo last month, Brits beat Bubka for the first time. Bubka,
dismissed him as ''nothing special. He is just ordinary.'' A week later
came Sestriere, which was notable for another reason -- Brits joined the
six-metre club previously occupied only by Bubka and Russia's Rodion
Gataullin.
Bubka managed to snatch victory, the threat of defeat propelling him
over six metres for the first time this year. Their battle promises to
be one of the events of the championships.
If Bubka is uncharitably dismissive, Brits appears to worship his
rival. He has copied his habit of sucking lemons. The sour, sharp taste
jolts him alert in long competitions where the best sit round, inactive,
waiting to start, often long after poorer competitors are eliminated. He
has even named his Stafforshire bull terrier Bubka.
Brits saw Bubka clear 6.03 on TV when he was just 13. He measured the
height, and was smitten. He hauled his parents' bed into the garden when
they were at work, heaped up all the blankets, matresses and caprets he
could find, and built a bar and stands out of bamboo. Then he found a
length of heavy electrical pipe to use as a pole.
When his father came home he thrashed him. It turned out that he had
been a vaulter himself and did not wish his son to have anything to do
with such a dangerous event.
It has been a vain hope as his son pursued a career with its bleak
moments -- like last year's Commonwealth Games where, as red-hot
favourite, he failed to clear a height and went home in tears. When he
arrived, his coach ordered him back on the plane, telling him he was
vaulting at the World Cup final in London.
''I did not want to go,'' he admits. But he was persuaded, and cleared
his then best ever height, 5.90m, to win.
The experience was a turning point. Until then, six metres had been
the Holy Grail for Brits, dubbed by his countrymen the Indiana Jones of
athletics. Now what he wants is the scalp of his hero. ''I want to own
the record -- I want to break the world record 35 more times.''

AFTER all the bad news it was time for some good news to radiate from
the apparently trouble-torn GHK club in Glasgow.
A lunch with Dave Jerdan, Gordon Ash and Walter Malcolm was all it
took to persuade Hugh Campbell to agree to become the club's coach for
the coming season.
''I want to help Glasgow rugby, and in particular GHK,'' said
Campbell, the former Glasgow and Jordanhill tight-head prop and district
coach. ''I was told that my coming would keep some of the players who
had said they would leave at the club. I understand that apart from a
couple they will now stay.''
Last week The Herald reported that Fergus Wallace and Shade Munro had
been added to a list of players about to leave GHK. Asked whether his
post was a paid one, Campbell merely replied: ''Rugby is an amateur
game. I am really surprised you asked that question.''
Malcolm, who retired at the end of last season after captaining the
side, was instrumental in bringing Campbell into the fold, and he has
been out training with the club and is likely to play this season.
''I was coached by Hugh, and I played alongside him as a young man at
Jordanhill,'' said Malcolm. ''He is just the kind of coach we need. He
will coach Tuesday and Thursday throughout the league campaign, and come
to the games on as many Saturdays as he can.
''As far as I am concerned, I was never going to run away from the
club, but whether I play or not depends on players leaving or staying. I
am confident, though, that Hugh's arrival will persuade the players to
stay.''
Campbell's arrival has indeed persuaded Andrew Ness to stay -- he had
said he was moving to Watsonians -- and Shade Munro, the injured
internationalist, will also remain at GHK. The club has secured Alan
Watt's future by doing what they can to find him employment.
''Wattie never wanted to leave the club,'' said Malcolm. ''He was
chased very hard by Watsonians, even to the extent of them asking him to
send through his cv and they would find a good job. However, we have our
own experts in the club and we are progressing that.''
Campbell says he looks forward to taking up his new job under director
of rugby Andy Little. ''I think we have a good side,'' he says. ''I took
the boys a couple of times last year and I was impressed by them. I have
agreed to be there until the end of the league season, and will see what
happens after that.''

DAVE Bowman is convinced that his testimonial match against Dundee on
Sunday will give Dundee United, last term's premier division drop-outs,
a real insight to what lies ahead of them in the new season.
Bowman, signed from Coventry City in May, 1986, waited eight years to
win a trophy with United. Now he says: ''There is no doubt the highlight
of my time with United was winning the Scottish Cup against Rangers at
Hampden last year.
''It is equally important for everyone at the club to go all out to
match that success by winning the first division championship. There is
no doubt in my mind that would be every bit as satisfying as winning the
cup.
''It would be important for United, because they are a major club, and
for the players, because our aim has to perform at the highest level. I
have no disrespect for the first division, but we don't really want to
be visiting some of the grounds any longer than is absolutely
necessary.''
When Dundee were asked to supply the opposition for the benefit match,
Bowman had hoped both clubs would be part of the new season's premier
division. However, as Bowman pointed out: ''The match does give us a
taste of what is in front of us.''

IF Celtic took heart from the second-half performance against Everton
at Goodison Park on Tuesday night, when they notched a 2-2 draw, then
there was still more encouragement for manager Tommy Burns and his men
afterwards.
Because the man they had travelled south to honour, veteran Welsh
international keeper Neville Southall was confidently tipping the
Parkhead men to make an impact in the European Cup-winners' Cup along
with his own club -- and perhaps even end Rangers' long running
dominance of the premier division.
Southall had been mightily impressed by Celtic's display in the second
half after they had gone two goals behind before half-time.
Looking back on the game, he insisted: ''I don't see any reason why
Celtic should not have a good, long run in the Cup-winners' Cup. We are
looking for the same and there are similarities between our sides.
''I just hope that we don't meet early in the competition -- it would
be fine if we were to meet in the final.
''I know that we are expecting to go a long way in Europe and on their
second-half performance Celtic could do the same.
''In fact, they could do themselves even more good at home, because
when they turned it on I realised this was a team who could win the
title up there. That would probably be good for the game in Scotland,
instead of just having the one team winning the league every year. I'd
like to see Celtic do it.''
There were several reasons for Southall espousing the cause of Burns
and his men. Two of them were the outstanding players for Celtic on the
night, and another was the fierce and committed support of the 8000 fans
Celtic had taken south with them.
Said Southall: ''If 8000 can make that noise then I can imagine what a
full house in Glasgow would be like. You'd feel that you had to win
honours for supporters like these.''
Then the keeper turned to the players and added: ''I had to be at my
best to stop a couple of shots Pierre van Hooydonk threw at me during
the match. The Dutchman caused us a few worries in the same way as big
Duncan Ferguson worried their defence.
''Van Hooydonk has a lot of skill and his free kicks are special. When
he has Andreas Thom alongside him then Celtic will have a potent
partnership up front.
''I have played against Thom for Wales, so I know how good he can be.
He will be a tremendous asset. His influence will spread through the
whole team. It's always the same when a top player joins a club,
everyone is lifted, and that will happen with Celtic.
''The team will be even better than they were tonight, though it would
be difficult for John Collins to be any better. He was superb, quite
apart from the two goals he scored.
''He was the complete midfield man and he would be a sensation playing
down here in our Premiership. I honestly think Celtic are now ready to
be a major force in the game. Their cup win is probably the boost they
have been needing.''
Celtic themselves were content with the performance, and pleased that
Burns' predictions of a gradual build-up to reach the playing level he
wants is being confirmed.
Goalkeeper Pat Bonner predicted: ''Other players will be coming here
as well as Andreas Thom. When they do, the squad will be even stronger.
''I know Rangers have bought players, but that was something they had
to do. We all knew that they would buy, because last season they were
not as good as they had been in previous years. We sensed that in our
games against them.''
Bonner is right in that assessment. He will be hoping now that his
summing up of his own club's prospects are as accurate and that,
perhaps, they can do what Neville Southall believes they are capable of
doing.
* DENMARK'S Peter Mikkelson will referee Scotland's European
qualifying match against Greece at Hampden on August 16. Scotland
manager Craig Brown will announce his squad next Tuesday.

COURTAULDS Textiles chief executive Noel Jervis is hoping the current
heatwave will be followed by a ''long, early, cold autumn'' and right
now a lot of people would no doubt agree with him.
The present weather is helping to clear out stocks of summer clothes
and a cold September would give a welcome boost to the start of the
autumn/winter season. But as things stand the outlook is dull, with
demand softening and margins pressured by rising raw material costs.
The prospect yesterday lopped 11p from Courtaulds Textiles shares at
465p, despite a 17% rise in profits to #10.3m before exceptionals in the
first half of 1995, and a 6% increase in the interim dividend to 5.2p.
''The fragility of the current economic recovery throughout Europe and
the US was reflected in the softening of demand in the second quarter
compared with the first,'' observed Mr Jervis.
The final five months of the year are the most important and the
present state of consumer confidence does not inspire hopes for a strong
sales performance.
In such a climate it is difficult to pass on raw material cost
increases. The group is about maintaining margins as a result of keeping
a tight rein on other costs and the raw material picture is brightening.
Natural fibre prices have weakened and man-made fibres appear to be
topping out.
First half like-for-like sales were up 8%, though demand was hit by
the cold spring as well as depressed consumer spending. On a similar
basis, profits were 27% ahead owing to lower reorganisation spending,
operational improvements in branded clothing and a strong showing by
lace fabrics.
In own-label clothing, sales advanced by 13%, with those to other
multiples outstripping sales to Marks &amp; Spencer, where they were 8%
ahead. Bra sales were well up, but demand for slips was down owing to
the swing towards less formal outerwear styles. Profits were lower
because of pressure on margins.

JOHN Fashanu yesterday announced his retirement from football.
According to a statement from Aston Villa, Fashanu has finally taken the
advice of specialists urging him to call it a day because of a serious
knee injury.
The announcement comes just a week after the 31-year-old striker was
charged by the police with offences relating to match-fixing.
FIFA has urged the Football Association to take ''urgent and
appropriate measures'' against Fashanu and the other players charged,
Bruce Grobbelaar and Hans Segers.
Now, at least, Fashanu has been forced to take his own action, leaving
Villa free to claim compensation for the #1.35m they paid Wimbledon for
his services 12 months ago.
The one-time Barnardos boy, who won an FA Cup winners' medal with
Wimbledon in 1988, has been unable to shake off the injury sustained
last February in a clash with Manchester United's Ryan Giggs, who was
also forced to leave the field through injury.

* SPANISH football was in uproar yesterday after Seville and Celta of
Vigo were kicked out of the first division down to the Second B league,
the equivalent of being relegated from the premier division to the
second division.
The decision by the Spanish League led to thousands of outraged fans
massing outside the clubs' stadiums in protest.
The ruling was made after both clubs failed to supply guarentees of
five percent of their total budgets for the coming season as laid down
by a new government law passed in the spring that clubs must prove their
solvency.
Seville, who are in next season's UEFA Cup and have been in the first
division for 54 seasons out of their 90-year history, should have
presented a guarentee of #450,000 by Monday.Celta, who have spent 35 of
their 72 years in the top division, failed to guarantee #215,000.
Both clubs insist that it was a human error and Seville even faxed a
copy of a cheque covering the missing amount to League headquarters.
However, the League have informed Albacete and Valladolid, both
relegated last season, that they would stay in the top league. They had
fully complied with the new law.

SIX world titles, a Commonwealth gold medal and two Mazda Jack High
wins bear weight to the theory expounded by most leading bowlers that
Richard Corsie has assumed the mantle from David Bryant as the world's
top player.
Whether it is the indoor carpet of Preston, the bumpy and bare greens
of Victoria, or the slicked manicured swards of Australia's Gold Coast,
they all come alike to the 28-year-old Edinburgh bowler.
But one jewel is missing from the Corsie crown -- the ScottishPower
National Singles championship, and Corsie means to rectify that at
Northfield this week.
Corsie looks to have been favoured by the draw and misses the top
quarter, which includes three internationalists and former winner George
Whitelaw, from Stonehouse. Corsie's opens against Alex Arbuckle at 11.30
this morning.
Indoor internationalists Graham Archer, from Sighthill, and Aberlady's
Ian Bell clash in the top match of the opening session at 9.30.
Whitelaw, the winner two years ago, is also in action, against Campsie's
George Kincaid, as is Danderhall's David Peacock, the beaten finalist
three years ago, who meets Brian Anderson, from Gala.

SCOTTISH companies were told yesterday that they have missed out on
plans to upgrade further the women's Scottish Open, which begins today
at Dalmahoy.
''The Scots will come to the party too late in the day,'' said Terry
Coates, chairman and chief executive of the American Express Tour, who
has spent two years trying to find a sponsor north of the Border for the
women's Scottish Open without success -- despite it being televised live
by BBC Scotland.
Yesterday he outlined his plans for the event: ''I plan to ensure that
the Scottish becomes as big as the British Open over the next three to
four years. I am not going to go away. I'm no longer going to spend my
time knocking on Scottish doors. We will seek our sponsorship, as we
have for this week, from the likes of American Express, Payne &amp; Gunter,
with the tour putting in some money.
''We will talk to global companies outside of Scotland. We are in open
dialogue with companies seriously interested in becoming involved with
the Scottish Open to ensure the event carries on into the future and
that the prize fund moves up substantially and begins to match the
British Open.
''I see no reason why we can't do that. We have the backing of BBC
Scotland. They won't go away; they will support us. We are now talking
to some very interested parties. To be upbeat, I have three events in
Europe worth #1m. We do have a target that might turn this tournament
into a prize fund that would double that overnight.
''I am no longer going to talk negatively about the Scottish Open. We
have now changed our sponsorship strategy. I want the Scottish to be the
jewel in our crown, but the Scots will come to the party too late in the
day,'' said Coates.
Most of the field for the #75,000 tournament have arrived in a state
of shock after their mauling by Laura Davies in Ireland last week.
Davies retained her Irish Open crown with an awesome exhibition. Her
25-under-par total beat by three strokes the world record Davies had
shared with Scotland's Dale Reid and Americans Nancy Lopez and Beth
Daniel.
What can Davies do for an encore? She returns to the course where she
won last year and two years earlier was the inspiration behind Europe's
Solheim Cup victory.
Prior to Ireland, the world No.1 had, by her own high standards, three
mediocre finishes. Wayward drives undermined her confidence which was
restored last week.
''I am looking forward to defending, especially after last week. I
love Dalmahoy, which is very similar to the course last week, and I
think I am back on a roll again,'' said Davies, who will equal Dale
Reid's record 21 Tour victories if she retains her title.
Scotland's Kathryn Marshall and Florence Descampe will play alongside
Davies in the opening two rounds starting at 9.30am today. ''I should be
the shortest hitter in this game,'' said Marshall, who is playing in
only her third European event this year.
Last month Marshall joined the growing band of Europeans to win in the
United States when she won the Jamie Farr Toledo Classic in Ohio to earn
a $75,000 top prize. She was the first Scot to win on that tour.
In only her third season on the LPGA Tour, the Scot said: ''Over the
last 18 months the experience of playing in America has improved my game
by 100%.'' A first European win is not beyond her.

RICHARD Hope was frank enough to admit that the Scottish trip to last
week's Canadian National Swimming Championships was a major
disappointment.
But he is hoping that a few lessons have been learned as he looks
forward to representing Britain in the World Student Games in Japan
later this month.
''We only had two days between arriving in Winnipeg and then having to
swim, and it wasn't enough time to acclimatise,'' admitted the
19-year-old, who had travelled with high hopes of breaking the Scottish
200 metres back-stroke record.
''The swimming really didn't go well at all. Everyone was really tired
and there certainly weren't any highlights.''
After a couple of days' rest, he will be back in training with the aim
of regaining his confidence before heading to Japan for the British
Student Games training camp in Kobi a week on Saturday.
Paul Latimer, who has just completed his first year at the University
of Texas, is the other Scot in the British side. He has been selected in
the 200m butterfly and 200m medley.
* BRYAN Morgan last night demolished the field in the 200m back-stroke
for 15-year-olds at the ASA National Age Group Championships in Leeds.
Morgan, who represents the Dunfermline-based Carnegie club, recorded
2min 10.09sec to finish nearly four seconds ahead of Stourbridge's Karl
Shepherd.
Morgan's time was also just over a second outside the long-standing
Scottish junior record set in 1981 by Aberdeen's Neil Cochran.
Biggest shock of the evening came from Carrie Mayer of Derby in the
200m medley after the 16-year-old was the slowest qualifier for the
final and so swam in outside lane eight.
But in doing so she was out of sight of the middle lanes and, holding
a slight lead at the end of all but the breaststroke leg, she stole a
march on her rivals to win in 2mins 25.78secs.
The controversy surrounding the American contingent at the event raged
on after the jury of appeal ruled that the US swimmers who had been
entered in the wrong age groups would be allowed to swim in the heats
but not the finals.
The two who had been entered in the correct age groups will be allowed
to compete in the finals if they reach them.

A CONSISTENT northerly breeze at last brought Tennents West Highland
Yachting Week to sparkling life yesterday.
In what must surely be one of Europe's most picturesque sailing arenas
-- out at the western opening to the Sound of Mull near Tobermory, where
the race track is bordered to the north by the majesty of the
Ardnamurchan Peninsula and the lush greenery of Mull to the south --
conditions proved perfect for what is now likely to be the only Olympic
triangle race of this regatta week.
In Caribbean sunshine, the wind rose to a welcome 15 knots and the
one-hour postponement until the breeze settled was well worth the wait,
even if many doubters -- scunnered by three days in the doldrums --
expected more of the same and instead chose the golf course or a
leisurely cruise elsewhere. They missed the best days racing yet.
The race management team read the new filling breeze well and situated
the first windward buoy near perfectly high on the Ardnamurchan shore.
With Class 1 away first, the boats which opted for the right-hand
side, led by Scott Chalmers' First Class 10 Highlander, were rewarded
with a wind shift dividend which saw them right on the heels of the
fastest rated boats.
Highlander finished third on corrected time with the pair of new
Melges 24s taking the top two places.
Clyde sailmaker Chris Owen steered Tunnock's Teacake to victory. After
jousting throughout with opponent Ian Cleaver on Highland Heritage,
Teacake sailed higher and faster up the final beat to win by 27 seconds.
In Class 2, Arthur Harvey's S &amp; S 34 Vigil notched up their second win
of the week to lead the division.
Vigil powered away from Tuesday's race winner Chris Morrison on Quaila
who took second and lies second overall.
In the Sigma 33 fleet there has now been a different winner each day.
David Wilson's Vendaval won yesterday but it is Alan Milton's Pepsi
which leads overall.
Classes seven and eight had an inshore race further down into the
Sound of Mull and Roger Clegg's Mezzanine of Down triumphed in Class 7
for the second day in succession while Alan Armstrong's Northney 34
Reiver of Lorne won Class 8. Results:
Class 1 -- Tunnock's Teacake (C Owen) 1hr 27min 56sec; 2, Highland
Heritage (I Cleaver) 1-28.23; 3, Highlander (S Chalmers) 1-29.34.

Connelly) 1-27.08; 3, Pepsi (A Milton) 1-29.06. Overall -- Pepsi.

Dundee 2, Bolton Wanderers 2
A MISTAKE by manager Jim Duffy denied Dundee a notable pre-season
victory at Dens Park. Duffy, playing as a substitute, mishit a pass-back
and former Airdrie striker Owen Coyle nipped in to earn Bolton a
fortunate draw.
Earlier, young Jim Hamilton took the chance to increase his potential
value in the transfer market by scoring for Dundee in 29 minutes. A
through ball by Kevin Bain found Hamilton just outside the penalty area
and he easily held off Bolton skipper Alan Stubbs before scoring off the
far post.
It was a notable success for the Dens Park youngster, who was linked
last season with Liverpool and Blackburn, against a player for whom
Bolton last month turned down a #4m Arsenal offer.
Hamilton almost added to Bolton's blushes three minutes later, when he
delivered a perfect cross to the far post only for Neil Duffy's header
to force a memorable save from Keith Branagan.
Duffy had excelled at the other end earlier in the game with a fine
saving tackle to prevent Fabian De Freitas. Dundee had lost Dusan Vrto
early in the game after a collision with Owen Coyle.
Bolton were far more fired up in the second half. Stubbs appeared to
aim a kick at Hamilton and Jason McAteer was warned along with Gerry
Britton after the pair squared up.
The extra effort also brought the English club an equaliser, Scot
Green heading in Coyle's cross.
Young Hamilton again upset the Bolton defence by holding off Berggson
to provide the cross which Britton drove home in 70 minutes, but then
came the unfortunate incident involving Duffy.

AN eyesore in the centre of Glasgow is being razed to the ground to
make way for a prestigious new office building. The former Ashley House
at 181/195 West George Street will be replaced by a #12m office building
which, its agents claim, could be ''the single most important office
development to be undertaken in the heart of Glasgow for many years.''
The proposed 77,500 sq ft scheme by the Scottish Amicable Life
Assurance Society has been designed by architects Hugh Martin
Partnership in sandstone and granite.
Planning permission has been obtained for an eight-storey building
which will include 46 parking spaces. David Hunter, property director at
Scottish Amicable Investment Managers, said: ''As investors we recognise
that Scottish Amicable will achieve maximum performance through owning
top quality buildings which tenants wish to occupy.
''This development gives us the opportunity to provide a building, in
the finest location in Glasgow, which is designed to meet the needs of
today's occupier.''
Interested occupiers won't have to wait for long to see the new
development taking shape. Completion is set for Autumn 1996 and DTZ
Debenham Thorpe is already talking to potential tenants.

DEMAND for office accommodation and for industrial investments in
Scotland is set to increase, according to two major market reports.
The Future for Offices, a survey by property consultants Grimley,
concludes that there will be a higher demand for offices for the next
few years and warns that would-be tenants will find a scarcity of supply
due to the recent low level of development.
The report also says that the trend towards out-of-town office
development will continue, despite recent Scottish Office planning
guidelines geared towards encouraging city centre development.
Guy Thorley of Grimley said: ''The report backs up what we are
witnessing throughout the Central Belt of Scotland -- high quality open
plan office accommodation is becoming all the scarcer with increased
demand. This is obviously good news for many sectors of the Scottish
economy and reflective of the Scottish recovery.''
But hopes that Scotland might benefit from firms relocating from
London to cheaper accommodation north of the border will be dashed by
the Grimley research. The report reveals that in 1988, London rentals
were five times higher than Glasgow's and Edinburgh's, but are now only
about one-and-a-half times as expensive.
Meanwhile, a report on industrial investment by property consultants
Ryden concludes that average industrial rental growth in Scotland has
outstripped the rest of the UK over the last 14 years. With interest
rates predicted to peak at 8% over the next few years, the high income
returns from industrial and warehousing investment appear ''increasingly
attractive'', says the report. Among its other key conclusions are:
* Higher yields are available from Scottish industrials.
* The wind-up of the new towns will see a reduction in the supply of
new industrial property.
* Property companies which have not been too badly affected by the
slump of the early 1990s have made ''steady progress'' in acquiring high
yielding investment properties.
* Scotland's industrial market has avoided the extremes of rental
growth and decline which have affected the rest of the UK during the
1980s and 1990s.
The report also highlights trends in particular parts of Scotland,
including the effect on industrial investment of Aberdeen's oil industry
and the creation of the Lanarkshire Enterprise Zone.

A CURRENT internationalist, as Simon Mackenzie is, faced a degree of
embarrassment if he failed to beat his non-playing captain, which Colin
Dalgleish is, but that emotion was avoided in the third round of the J&amp;B
Scottish Amateur championship yesterday at Southerness, though not
without anxious moments.
The West Linton golfer, runner-up for this year's strokeplay title,
remarked after his 2 and 1 victory on another afternoon of blast-furnace
heat: ''It was good to get one over on Colin, for the match was never
going to be easy.''
Indeed, in reaching the last 32, Mackenzie, a semi-finalist in 1993,
seriously missed only one fairway from the tee.
This was remarkable for, after days under a burning sun and a lively
easterly breeze, the fairways have become decidedly tricky, reflecting
David Feherty's recent comment on the difference between American and
links golf: ''There you stop worrying when the ball hits the ground,
here you start.''
In such conditions, patience becomes the most demanding of virtues.
Moreover, with two days of two matches each before Saturday's 36-hole
final, and the forecast for the ferocious temperature to continue, the
test will be not merely of playing ability, and adaptability, but of
physical fitness and mental resilience.
In these circumstances the proven competitor usually prevails.
Mackenzie this morning inherits another hot handful in the powerful
figure of Langholm's Graham Davidson, yet to be taken beyond the
fourteenth.
It was there that Davidson, soon to step up from Midland College,
Texas, to the University of Mississippi, finished off local golfer Ian
Reid with a 12-foot birdie putt unblushingly holed, for a 20-year-old,
left hand below right.
Alan Reid, the first quarter's seed, will meet the winner, provided he
beats Ian Brotherston, the 39-year-old Dumfries baker and a former
internationalist.
Reid had the closest escape of the three seeds in the top half, never
ahead of Powfoot's Clifton Wright until he won the long eighteenth in
par to join Barclay Howard and Graham Rankin in the fourth round.
Howard and Rankin seem to be sharing a somewhat disturbed lifestyle
with three others accommodated in a caravan nearby designed for four.
Undeterred, Howard quickly took the initiative against Cowal's Lorn
Kelly to be four up after seven holes in three under par and Rankin beat
both his opponents yesterday on the thirteenth green.
Also still alive in the same quarter are two of the country's most
promising young players, Michael Brooks, the son of Andrew who is now
professional at Royal St George's and on the fringe of senior
international status, and Cardross's Steven Carmichael, the British
Universities champion last year.
Hugh McKibbin, the holder, and Allan Turnbull emerged as the only
unscattered seeds of the bottom half of the draw, after the first defeat
of a seed, David Downie. McKibbin, who made a rare birdie 3 at the
downwind twelfth, where the hole was cut unchivalrously close to the
front of the green, will now meet Graham Lowson, winner of the title
four years ago.
Meanwhile, David Robertson, despite his own misgivings about his
fitness, won twice, after having been two down in both matches, and
Scott Knowles, a former internationalist, included in his second victory
of the day the first hole-in-one of his career -- with a No.4-iron shot
at the 215-yard seventh.

THE drive to create and grow more new businesses in Scotland received
a major boost yesterday with an agreement between Scottish Enterprise
and the European Investment Fund (EIF) -- a new financial agency of the
European Union
The agreement -- which is seen as the final stage of Scottish
Enterprise's strategy to improve capital provision for new and growing
companies -- has been reached to allow the EIF to provide a guarantee to
private sector partners in a fund which Scottish Enterprise plans to set
up to inject equity finance into small and medium-sized companies.
The fund, which will be known as the Scottish Equity Partnership
(SEP), intends to provide a means by which small and medium-sized
companies can access equity finance between #50,000 and #500,000 where
there is a perceived funding gap.
The agreement in principle between Scottish Enterprise and the EIF
will safeguard contributions made to the new fund by private sector
partners, which are expected to include the banks, insurance companies,
fund managers, and private sector corporations.
The SEP will seek to raise #25m of funds, split 50-50 between Scottish
Enterprise and the private sector, and is expected to be officially
launched with the money in place early next year.
David McGlue, executive director of the Luxembourg-based EIF, said:
''This agreement in principle is another important step along the road
of improving new firm formation in Scotland.
''It is proposed that the European Investment Fund will guarantee the
return of the participation from the private sector to the fund.
Normally the guarantee would cover only 50% of their stake.
''This participation means that their entire participation will be
safeguarded. This has been achieved by Scottish Enterprise giving up its
right to a guarantee.''
He stressed that, while the SEP would guarantee that investors do not
lose their money, it would not guarantee a return, adding that the
intention was that it would be a 10 year fund with three one-year
periods after the 10 years in which investors can make realisations.
Russel Griggs, director of business development at Scottish
Enterprise, said Scottish Enterprise, through the SEP, would seek to
broaden the range of people who invest in small and medium-sized
companies, to include in particular the financial community and larger
corporations, because the majority of them tend to invest in blue chip
shares.
He said this was because these offered good returns and dividends, but
pointed out that equally good returns could be had from small and
medium-sized firms.
He added: ''But like everything you have got to dip your toe in the
water to get to understand whether it is hot or cold, and what we have
tried to do is put in place a vehicle that gives them that balance and
allows them to get into and understand the market which will hopefully
get them involved much more in the future.''
Scottish Enterprise has invested in the small and medium size company
sector through its investment arm Scottish Development Finance since
1982, and its total investment of #50m has helped to lever #400m from
the private sector into such companies.

COLIN Montgomerie, like Open Champion John Daly, believes this week's
Scandinavian Masters is the ideal preparation for the US PGA
Championship.
''I agree it's like an American course,'' the Scot said yesterday in
Malmo. ''I'm very happy about it. If I win here I will return to the top
of the Order of Merit which gives me a little incentive.
''I'm pleased with the way I am playing. I was four under for the back
nine today which cannot be bad. I did not have the best of luck in the
Dutch Open but I'm looking forward to this week.''
The field includes 1991 winner Montgomerie, Ian Woosnam and Ryder Cup
hopefuls Darren Clarke, Miguel Angel Jimenez, Jesper Parnevik, Philip
Walton, Per-Ulrik Johansson, Peter Baker, Paul Broadhurst, Mark James
and Barry Lane.
Eight other Scots are in the field -- Gordon Brand Jr, Adam Hunter,
Gary Orr, Andrew Coltart, Ross Drummond, Mike Miller, Stephen
McAllister, and Dean Robertson.

PROPOSALS for a new business park scheme on the north side of Glasgow
have been unveiled.
Business Homes, a division of Marshall Construction, has lodged a
planning application for a 50,000 sq ft business park on land
immediately adjacent to Junction 15 on the M8 near the top of High
Street.
To be known as the Junction 15 Business Park, the scheme proposes four
two-storey buildings with 175 on-site parking spaces.
The developers anticipate that planning consent will be granted for
the site, which was acquired on a ground lease from Glasgow District
Council. The first two buildings, of 8000 sq ft and 12,200 sq ft
respectively, could be available for occupation by February 1996.
Business Homes is represented by Chesterton and Montagu Evans.

A NARROWING of the UK's visible global trade deficit for May to #861m
from April's revised #1301m (previously #1411m) caught the market on the
hop. The consensus had been for a deficit of around #1000m, but at least
this time round the outcome was better than expected, and trade with the
EU was encouraging.
For most of this year analysts have been underestimating the size of
the gap. April's figure was exceptionally high, however, boosted by
erratic items, in particular lower exports of precious stones, higher
purchases of foreign built aircraft, and the importation of the cruise
ship Oriana, which added some #300m to the import bill.
Though for the most part greeted positively in the market, much of
May's improvement is therefore accounted for by the drop in erratics
compared to the preceding month.
In fact, after excluding erratics and also oil, which dipped from
#486m to #394m, with exports down and imports up, reflecting lower
production in the month, the balance of trade worsened a shade to #1383m
against #1289m in April.
However, in the three months to May, the estimates show the visible
trade deficit decreasing from #3011m in the previous three months to
#2682m. Excluding oil and erratics it fell by around #500m over the
period, with exports at a record #33m for the period against imports of
#37m.
The Central Statistical Office takes a cautious view of the figures.
It says the pattern of deficit over the last few months has been
erratic, making it difficult to estimate the trend.
But bearing this in mind, the latest estimate does suggest the trend
in the whole world visible deficit is flat. Figures released last month
for non-EU trade indicated that the US economic slowdown was starting to
hit UK business, with exports falling sharply in the three months to
June. Prior to this, the UK has shown firm export growth to the US.
The UK's deficit with the EU countries plunged from #768m to #227m in
May as exports rose from #6986m to #7439m and imports fell from #7754m
to #7666m. The value of total exports in May was up 3% on April at
#12588m, while imports slipped [1/2]% to #13449m, largely as a result of
lower imports from the EU.
In terms of volume there was a 2[1/2]% increase in May after stripping
out oil and erratics while, on the same basis, imports rose 2%. Trends
in trade volume show both exports and imports to be fairly stable.
Underlying volumes rose by 0.9% in the latest three months, while
prices were up 4%, indiciating that rising prices are a major factor in
the increase in exports.
The figures were welcomed by President of the Board of Trade Ian Lang,
who said: ''UK exporters are showing that UK competitiveness is reaching
new peaks in a tough world market place.'' He said the volume of
UK-manufactured exports since 1981 had grown faster than in France,
Germany and Japan, with British firms enjoying strong growth in sectors
ranging from electronics to sports equipment.''
Adam Cole, of Securities house James Capel, said that in underlying
terms the deficit is on a broadly stable trend. Over the rest of this
year he expects a modest deterioration in the visible trade balance.
While the weakness of sterling points to stronger exports over the
coming months, a likely bounce in domestic demand growth during the
second half of the year will stimulate import growth.
Meanwhile, figures from the Bank of England show that net lending to
consumers fell slighty to #591m in June, compared to May's #625m --
itself revised upwards from #584m. This represents a 1% monthly
increase, the same as in May.
The market had been looking for around #525m and the figures show that
consumer credit growth remained strong during the month. Mortgage
borrowing rose 0.4% in June, the same rate of increase as in May. The
annual rate of growth of mortgage borrowing fell slightly to to 4.9%
from 5.1%, below the rates of growth of around 5.5% recorded in the
second half of last year.
Goldman Sachs considers that, in terms of policy, the weak housing
market and weak mortgage lending will have more influence than will the
continued strength in consumer credit, which has not reflected trends in
retail spending very accurately over the past year.

FALKIRK's Colin Gillies equalled the day-old course record in the
second round of the Glenmuir Club Professionals championship at West
Hill, Surrey, yesterday, carding a five-under-par 64 to lead the #63,000
flagship tournament by a stroke in his first ever outing.
The 29-year-old, who landed the Scottish Professional championship at
Dalmahoy in May, rediscovered his waning putting touch on unpredictable
greens. He rolled in six birdie putts to edge ahead of a cluster which
included Musselburgh's Fraser Mann.
Having been frustrated during a level-par opening round, Gillies felt
his leading halfway score was just reward for a prolonged spell of good
form.
He said: ''I have been playing and travelling a lot in the past month
so I feel perhaps it caught up with me in my first round, but my short
game is in extremely good shape and I putted well today which pleased
me.''
Despite winning three domestic tournaments this season, Mann has
struggled with ''psychological putting problems'' and was far from
complimentary about the unpredictable greens.
None the less, the 35-year-old holed four birdie putts during his
three-under-par 66 to move alongside Northern Open winner, Joe Higgins,
Richmond's Nick Job, new course record-holder Gary Brown of Ganton, and
Wraith Grant of West Berkshire. Leading scores:
133 -- C Gillies (Falkirk) 69, 64.
134 -- F Mann (Musselburgh) 68, 66; J Higgins (Patshull Park) 69, 65;
G Brown (Ganton) 72, 62; N Job Richmond 65, 69; W Grant (West Berkshire)
68, 66.
135 -- H Stott (Laleham) 70, 65; P Carman (Huddersfield) 66, 69; J
Murray (Sidcup) 69, 66; A MacKenzie (Calcott Park) 67, 68.
Other Scottish qualifiers included: 138 -- D Scott (Letham Grange) 66,
72
139 -- K Stables (Montrose) 70, 69. 140 -- R Weir (Cowal) 68, 72.
Scottish non-qualifiers: 143 -- S Callan (Dalmahoy) 66, 77. 145 -- A
Marshall (Kingsknowe) 72, 73; G Law (Uphall) 70, 75. 146 -- C Maltman
(Eyemouth) 70, 76; T Coles (King James VI) 74, 72. 149 -- A McCloskey
(Airdrie) 76, 73. 150 -- A Webster (Edzell) 78, 72.
No returns: S Kerr (Renfrew), D Robinson (Fereneze). Disqualified: K
Hutton (Downfield).

RYDER Cup veterans Neil Coles and Brian Huggett summoned all their
experience to cope with fast, running conditions that frustrated lesser
talents in the opening round of the Lawrence Batley Seniors tournament
yesterday.
The British pair kept their heads on the fiery Pennine fairways of the
Fixby course, overlooking Huddersfield, to post one-under-par 70s, two
of only four scores that beat the par of 71.
Coles, who shot a 66 in the pro-am, said: ''It's the best I have
played for two years. It's very difficult out there, but I managed to
hole a few putts.''
Coles and Huggett are two behind American leader DeRay Simon, a
little-known Californian, whose three-under-par 68 was the first score
in and stayed at the top all day.
Italian Alberto Croce fired a hat-trick of birdies from the third on
the way to a 69 and second place. Leading scores (British or Irish
unless stated):
68 -- D Simon (USA). 69 -- A Croce (Italy). 70 -- B Huggett, N Coles.
71 -- B Hunt, J Morgan, L Higgins.
* HOLDER Mark Foster, from Worksop, is the only seed left in the
English Amateur at Hunstanton, Norfolk, and even he stared defeat during
yesterday's third round. He fought back from three down to Burhill's
Paul Casey to win at the sixteenth.
Three seeds went out on the first two days and another four exited
yesterday -- Walker Cup players Lee James and David Howell, and England
internationals David Lyn and Richard Bland.
Warwickshire's Steve Webster, leading amateur in the Open, lost to
local boy Andrew Marshall, 4 and 2.
* GARRY Houston led the qualifiers into the knockout phase of the
Welsh Amateur championship over the Royal St David's links at Harlech
yesterday with a 36-hole total of 136.
Walker Cup man Bradley Dredge and fellow internationals David Park and
Matthew Ellis safely made progress.

aimed to confirm his recovery by playing for Surrey in today's Britannic

But Stewart's right index finger -- broken for the third time in nine

DESPITE denials from the medical team of the organising committee, the
salmonella outbreak in Posnam at the World Junior Rowing Championships
continues to be a growing problem, with reports of up to 100 victims now
affected.
At a news conference yesterday, the medical officer of the organising
committee said there had been no more than 35 athletes affected by the
outbreak, which was caused by food served at the official facilities.
But Dr Bill Webb of FISA, the world governing body, who had reported
65 as the number of victims on Tuesday, said yesterday that he now knew
of over 70 cases.
At the start of the outbreak, nine athletes had been taken to
hospital, six of whom were still detained yesterday. Some rose from sick
beds to take part, only to be returned straight away. While trying to
play down the problem, the Polish organisers said the outbreak was
caused in the regatta's official dining rooms, although they were unable
to pinpoint the cause.
The last time a world class rowing event was held on this course in
1958 -- a food poisoning outbreak also disrupted the programme.
Yesterday was the first full day of racing. Spectators were treated to
the bizarre sight of crew after crew coming gently down the course minus
a full complement of rowers. In men's coxless fours, only two
Australians took part. They received the warmest welcome of the day.
It does not matter how few crew members finish, as long as the boat
does. Failure to start would eliminate a crew, while a depleted crew
that covers the course has a second chance in today's repechages.
However, some are so badly affected that they will not be fit to
compete at all. Withdrawals are now being declared in some events.
Britain is one of 12 national teams affected, and Laura Fitzgibbon,
one of the three George Watsons College girls in the team, was taken out
yesterday. She was replaced by another Watsons member, Isabel Walker,
who was originally here to race in the eight only. It is too early to
say whether Fitzgibbon will be able to race again.
Altogether five of the 10 British boats included substitutes or sick
crew members yesterday and, with the exception of the men's coxed four
and eight, who moved on to the semi-finals by both coming third in their
opening races, all now depend on today's repechages.

TARTAN specialist SEET, which has been in the red since the late
1980s, moved into the black in the year to end-April. The
Edinburgh-registered company turned a pre-tax loss of #321,160 into a
profit of #51,353 and, now free of a disastrous stake in US retailing,
the textiles group is in better shape and going forward.
It is now looking for acquisitions in the textiles sector. It will
seek permission to increase its authorised share capital from 7.5
million to 10 million shares at an extraordinary meeting on August 24,
which would allow a rights issue if the need arose.
SEET also announced yesterday that it was purchasing the remaining 25%
of its highly-successful Peter MacArthur subsidiary from Alister
Bottomley, the son of the company's founder, Alfred, for #875,000.
The consideration will be satisfied through the issue of one million
SEET Ordinary shares to Mr Bottomley, who will become an executive
director, and a #245,000 cash payment.
Peter MacArthur, a leading producer of tartan, made after-tax profits
of #356,584 during the 12 months. Without the deduction of Mr
Bottomley's #89,146 minority interest from profits, SEET's bottom-line
loss for the financial year of #73,597 would have been a retained
profit.
SEET, which also makes fashion checks, as well as lambswool and mohair
products, received $1.5m (#937,000) on the sale of the assets of
Homemaker Shops at the end of July.
It had a 47% stake in Homemaker, which had outlets in Michigan, Ohio
and Pennsylvania, selling linen and towels. The latest figures include a
#108,480 trading loss from Homemaker, for the three months before the US
company's assets were sold.
As a result of the receipt from Homemaker and the disposal, for
#1.75m, of Stornoway-based tweed company Kenneth Mackenzie three years
ago, SEET's debt has been eliminated.
No dividend is being paid in respect of the year to end-April but the
company looks to be on the way back to the dividend list.
SEET's annual meeting comes just before the 70th birthday of chairman
Jock Mackenzie, who founded the company in 1969. As a result, he will
not be required to seek re-election until next year's meeting.
Mr Mackenzie's son, Johnny, will retire as a non-executive director
when Mr Bottomley joins the board. David Meddings, an independent
consultant who became a non-executive director last September, has been
appointed to the newly-created post of deputy chairman and finance
director.

SCOTTISH &amp; Newcastle chief executive Brian Stewart would appear to
have toasted an 18% pay hike last year, to more than #350,000, while the
average remuneration of the Edinburgh-based company's 44,000-strong
workforce fell 3% to #8600.
The company's annual report, published yesterday, reveals that
chairman Sir Alick Rankin's salary fell during the year to end-April. He
was overtaken as the brewing group's highest-paid director, presumably
by Mr Stewart.
On this assumption, Mr Stewart, 50, one of the most highly-rewarded
directors in Scotland, received salary, benefits and bonuses of #356,184
during the 12 months, compared with a figure of between #300,001 and
#305,000 the previous year. In addition, he received pension
contributions of #24,870.
Total employee costs rose from #327m to #380.6m, but with the
workforce rising from 36,830 to 44,256, the average remuneration per
employee, including employers' social security contributions, fell from
#8879 to #8600.
However, Scottish &amp; Newcastle pointed out that the Chef &amp; Brewer chain
of public houses, which the company acquired in September 1993, would
have had a greater proportion of part-time employees than the group's
brewing businesses.
Therefore, the total wages and salaries bill could not be expected to
grow in proportion to the increase in employee numbers.
Meanwhile, Sir Alick's salary and benefits, excluding pension
contributions, fell 13% to #261,097. With his existing service contract
having run out when he reached the age of 60 on January 23, the board
asked him to remain chairman until January 1997, but his terms were
renegotiated.
The question of who will succeed Sir Alick when he takes over the
chair of Perth-based insurance group General Accident has yet to be
decided.

FALKIRK-based coachbuilder Walter Alexander has been sold to the
Mayflower Corporation of High Wycombe in a deal worth #26.4m.
Established in 1924, Alexander is the biggest bus builder in Britain,
vying with Plaxton, with a #55m turnover last year and an outstanding
order book of the same size.
It was the subject of a #7.4m management buy-out in 1992, led by chief
executive Ian Galloway and two other executive directors. They own 15%
of the #1m equity, with other senior managers later being granted
options over another 5%.
So Mr Galloway and his immediate colleagues appear to have achieved a
22 fold return on their money, with a combined personal fortune of over
#3m.
Mr Galloway said he envisages no change in the management and running
of Alexander which has 950 employees, of whom 700 are in Falkirk and 250
in Belfast. The company has been expanding so rapidly that it has been
recruiting extra staff.
It has been in discussion with Mayflower, which made the initial
approach, for nearly nine months. Merchant bankers Close Brothers were
asked to seek industry buyers and over 30 interested parties made
contact.
A stock exchange listing was ruled out for several reasons. One was
that the City does not like companies seeking a listing just to enable
the venture capitalists to realise their investment, while Alexander
also did not need additional funds.
A third point was that at a market worth of under #30m, it was
fundamentally just too small, despite its excellent record and profits
potential as it expands ever faster into the Far East markets, where it
is a dominant player in Singapore and Hong Kong.
Mayflower, under chief executive John Simpson, has established itself
as a major force in specialist design and manufacture in the motor
industry.
Its most prestigious projects at present are the development of the
new MG, the MGF sports car, in association with Rover.
Mayflower is on a no lose #25m contract whereby its costs are fully
underwritten and it shares in the profits on any car sold. It is doing
some #40m of design work for the new Rolls-Royce due in 1997, as well as
a large number of confidential contracts.
Mr Simpson said that Mayflower's expertise would assist the
development of the Alexander business, which he expects to be able to
boost turnover next year to #70m, compared with #200m in the remainder
of Mayflower, which has a substantial Scottish institutional following.
The rapidly expanding Far East operations are a major attraction,
while in due course Mayflower's US representation could offer
opportunities in that territory.
Mayflower is funding the acquisition in part through a placing of 17.7
million shares to raise #12m, while the remainder will come from bank
facilities. Market reaction was highly positive, with existing shares
rising 9p to 80[1/2]p.
Interim pre-tax profits rose 81% to #6.4m, while the dividend was up
34% to 0.67p.

PAUL Eddery leapt to the defence of big brother Pat yesterday after
hearing about the latest suspension to hit the former champion. Pat was
given a seven-day suspension by the Jockey Club after a two-hour inquiry
into his riding of Inquisitor at Newmarket last month.
The ban comes into effect on Saturday and then from Monday until the
following Saturday inclusive. The former 10-times champion, looking
tanned after holidaying in Spain and the Isle of Wight, said he was
''delighted'' with the outcome, but Paul was less impressed.
Speaking at Brighton yesterday afternoon, Paul said: ''Pat should not
have got a single day. It was a joke.
''No jockey in the race wanted to go on. There were four horses behind
him who were being restrained. What was he supposed to do? He edged over
to the rails to avoid such a thing as clipping heels.
''So what are we going to do now: run in lines and forget about
jockeyship?
''All the other riders in the race were on his side in this. He did
nothing wrong. I don't know what the stewards were thinking about.''
In contrast, his elder brother said: ''I had a very fair hearing and
I'm very pleased with the way it went.''
Eddery had been suspended for 19 days at an earlier hearing -- and
faced a sentence that might have ruled him out of York's Ebor meeting,
starting on August 15. Previous suspension had seen him miss the Irish
Oaks, the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Diamond Stakes at Ascot and
the whole of Glorious Goodwood.
He is now free to ride at Newmarket tomorrow, when his 19-day
suspension ends, and will also be at Deauville on Sunday as the new ban
only covers days when there is racing in this country.
Eddery was referred to Portman Square because it was his fifth offence
of the current season, but the three-man disciplinary committee,
comprising chairman Anthony Mildmay-White, Chris Hall, and Nigel Clark,
decided that Eddery's Newmarket offence was careless and not
irresponsible.
The committee found that, shortly after the start, Inquisitor had
interfered with Craigmill who, in turn, caused interference to Nigel's
Lad and that Eddery was guilty of careless riding in that he allowed
Inquisitor to drift towards the rails, thereby causing interference.
There are currently 275 jockeys licensed to ride on the Flat in the UK
and, from January 1 to July 31, 90 of them had committed one or more
riding offence.
This has resulted in a total of 512 days' suspension being handed out
with 15 jockeys having accumulated 10 or more days' suspension.
A sixth of the riders who have offended account for 48% of the total
number of 'ban' days.
Mark Baird joined the list yesterday, when he was banned for five days
by the Brighton stewards for irresponsible riding on Prima Silk, who
finished third in the Tote Sprint Handicap, beaten a length and a
quarter and two and a half lengths by Walnut Burl and Samsolom.
They found that Baird had interfered with Sharp'N Smart, who finished
fifth, at the furlong marker. They suspended Baird from August 11 to 15
and promoted Lugana Vision to third and Sharp'N Smart to fourth, Prima
Silk being relegated to last.

GEOFF Wragg is fairly selective with the horses he sends to Pontefract
and his Roseberry Ray could provide the value in the Matty Bown Memorial
Maiden this afternoon.
A son of High Estate, Roseberry Ray was having only the second run of
his career when reappearing at Sandown last month, but ran with credit
to finish a never-nearer 12-length seventh of 15 to Grand du Lac.
That looked a very decent three-year-old maiden for this time of the
year and Roseberry Ray -- who has scope -- makes more appeal than the
exposed Raise The Stakes.
Followmegirls rates a corking bet to land the Chaplins Club Handicap.
The fact that two of her three career wins have come over this demanding
track augurs well for her chances.
Celandine should open her account in the Cornmill Hotel (Hull) Maiden.
The filly takes a big drop in class after tackling the much-hyped Bint
Shadayid on her Ascot debut, where she ran noticeably green in finishing
three and a half lengths third of four.
Finally, Seconds Away must be given a last chance to confirm earlier
promise in the Hamilton Maiden Handicap at the Scottish evening fixture.

SUEDORO and Birchwood Sun, who dead-heated in an exciting finish to a
six-furlong sprint at Hamilton Park in June, meet for the third time
over the same course this evening.
If Suedoro, Robert McKellar's five-year-old mare, bounces out of the
stalls as she did on Saturday evening when making all to beat Tutu
Sixtysix in impressive style, she should get the better of her rival
this time.
Birchwood Sun has not won since the dead-heat, but is 7lb better off
in the weights and has the added advantage of having Kevin Darley
aboard. In his last run, at Newcastle less than two weeks ago, Birchwood
Son went down by two and a half lengths to Mr Cube in an apprentice
handicap.
The pair last met at Hamilton four weeks ago in the Glengoyne Handicap
won by Profit Release. On that occasion Suedoro was fourth and Birchwood
Son three lengths away in seventh.
Linda Perratt's Diet, runner-up in that race, turns out tonight after
a break of 18 days. The consistent nine-year-old, who has won five times
at the Hamilton track, cannot be discounted.
The race commemorates the Yorkshire trainer Arthur Balding, who rode
at the inaugural Hamilton Park meeting in 1926 and held a trainer's
licence for 51 years.
Although the ground staff have been watering the course and have it in
excellent condition, the warm weather and the heavy programme of racing
has taken its toll. There are 31 runners with only four lining up in two
of the six races.
The Queen has a runner in the Gaetan Maiden Stakes. Silver Rondo,
trained by Lord Huntingdon, was third at Southwell last time. It is to
be hoped she fares better than Piquant, also owned by Her Majesty, who
finished seventh of eight runners at Edinburgh a month ago, when the
Queen opened the new hospitality suite.
Kevin Darley, in second place to Frankie Dettori in the jockeys'
championship, has five rides, four of them for Mrs Mary Reveley.
His best chance would appear to be aboard Bark'n'Bite in the Langs
Supreme Scotch Whisky Handicap. The three-year-old won a maiden handicap
here on Fair Friday and followed up at Pontefract six days ago.
Also fancied is Chris Thornton's Lord Hastie, a winner at Carlisle on
Monday and Newcastle a week before.

DEVOLUTION, as well as the broader question of the shape of the
constitutional system in the United Kingdom, is back at the centre of
political debate. Given the working assumption of most commentators and
many politicians that there will be a Labour Government after the next
General Election, there is an urgent need for Labour to be clear,
coherent, and convincing in its determination to create a Scottish
parliament.
There are signs, however, that Labour's medium to long-term view is
less robust than is its commitment to a Scottish parliament. Labour
needs to address this in a way that is less shambolic than its recent
U-turn on devolution to the English regions.
A key part of the Conservative attack on devolution has been the
charge that it would create an unnecessary level of government. In the
case of Scotland, the Tories, by the current reorganisation of local
government, have undermined their own argument, as they have in Wales
and in those areas of England where various reforms have produced
single-tier systems of local government.
But of greater importance than the number of levels is the nature of
the new level of government. It is here that Labour policy runs the risk
of incoherence. The insistence that what is proposed in Scotland is a
parliament defines that institution as national rather than
sub-national. This has important consequences not only for the
distribution of governmental functions, but also for intergovernmental
relations. The regional councils that may or may not be set up in
England (and, I would argue, the proposed Welsh Assembly) will be
essentially sub-national in character.
For Scotland it has been necessary to be clear about this for two
important reasons. First, it symbolises a genuine wish to respond to
that abstract but important thing, national aspiration and identity.
Secondly, it is a way of seeing off those local government critics of
devolution who would argue that a Scottish parliament will suck powers
up from local government.
If the new level is national, it becomes one end of the central-local
relationship. This should encourage, perhaps even ensure, clarity in the
distribution of powers. At its simplest it would mean that the new
Scottish local authorities retain their current powers while national
responsibility for most domestic policy is transferred downwards from
Westminster to Edinburgh.
In England (and in Wales) any new level of government will be
sub-national and so any redistribution of powers will involve a
consideration of what powers should be left with existing local
authorities and which might be better located at the regional level.
Labour is thus finding it very difficult to encompass Scottish
devolution and institutional change elsewhere in the UK in the same
argument. This is what made Jack Straw's announcement so vulnerable to
attack from both the Government and the SNP.
The Conservative attitude to devolution arises in part from the
readiness of the Prime Minister to wrap himself and his party in the
Union Jack as a response to devolution and the Euro-sceptics. But it is
more than that. For the more insistently Labour is asked questions about
devolution, the more fragile its current policies begin to look, at
least in UK electoral terms.
The West Lothian question, the origins of which are a mystery to the
many English journalists who were still in primary school last time it
was asked, remains relevant. For the issue it raises, of why Scottish
MPs at Westminster should have votes on domestic matters over which a
Scottish parliament, in which English MPs do not have a vote, has
jurisdiction, needs to be addressed seriously. It may not need to be
solved before the creation of a Scottish parliament, but campaigners for
devolution need to set out a timetable for its resolution.
It would be very difficult, as well as morally indefensible, for
Labour to renege on its commitment to legislate quickly for the creation
of a Scottish parliament. It may be odd that absolute priority is given
to a policy that directly affects only about 10% of the UK electorate,
but there it is. What Labour needs to do is look at the next steps more
seriously than it has so far done.
The memory of 1979, when devolution came apart largely because of the
opposition of the English MPs who feared that English regions would be
disadvantaged by the creation of a Scottish parliament, led Labour to
commit itself to a form of rolling regionalism. Some of the attacks on
it, particularly from Michael Heseltine and Alex Salmond, may be
regarded as part of the normal rough and tumble of party politics, but
there are serious questions lurking about under the exchanges of jibes
and insults.
If the Scottish parliament has power to vary income tax by 3% up or
down, is there a logical reason why that power should not be given to a
Welsh assembly or, eventually, to the English regional councils?
If the bulk of Scottish domestic expenditure is to be paid for by a
grant-in-aid to the Scottish parliament from Westminster, is it likely,
given the salience of macro-economic policy, that it will come without
strings?
If the grant is unconditional, will that not lead Wales and the
English regions to ask why the central focal financial relationship is
so differently ordered for them?
If the creation of a Scottish parliament is seen as the establishment
of a new national government for Scottish domestic matters, and its
grant is conditional, how will that be consistent with a financial
relationship that suggests a super local authority rather than a
national institution?
I find myself pushed inexorably towards the position that only a
fully-fledged federal solution, with all the attendant panoply of a
written constitution, can adequately square the many circles that
devolution draws in the shifting sands of political debate.
A federal solution would not automatically resolve the problems
outlined above, but it would make them less intractable than they
currently appear. No-one sensibly would argue that the Labour Party
could go into the next election with a fully-fledged federal
constitution in its manifesto, for that is not how fundamental
constitutional change is achieved. It could, however, accompany its
unshakable commitment to Scottish devolution with a guarantee that,
within the space of a parliament, a UK constitutional convention would
recommend a lasting settlement of the pressing problem of governing a
state that is united but not homogeneous.

LIZ TAYLOR writes of one man's dedicated effort to unearth medieval
secrets from a hospital site and how his work inspired a series of
paintings
WHEN artist JOAN SMITH visited a remote archaeological site on the top
of Soutra Hill, what she saw inspired her to create a series of
paintings.
Braving the elements one Sunday five years ago, Smith attended an
on-site lecture given by Dr Brian Moffat on the work he has been doing
for the past 10 years on the remains of a medieval hospital that once
dominated the hilltop overlooking the Lothians.
She was so enthralled by what she heard that she embarked on a series
of pictures that recorded her impressions of the windswept place. Some
of the pictures incorporate fragments of medieval manuscripts, drawings
of herbs that were used as treatments in the hospital, and impressions
of the huge vastness of the view from where it stood.
Smith explained: ''My visit to Soutra was a lucky coincidence. For
some time I had been interested in scientific images, biology, and
genetics, and then I read about Dr Moffat holding an open day at the
site of the old hospital. I went up to see what it was all about and his
enthusiasm fired my imagination.''
Dr Moffat is a most exasperating man to pin down. He has dedicated his
life to the excavation of the ancient Augustinian hospital at Soutra
which in the Middle Ages was the largest one north of York.
With his combed-down fringe of grey hair, he has the air of a monk, if
you can imagine one in red jeans and an open-neck shirt, and he admits
that he consciously identifies with the monks who worked at Soutra. For
the past decade he has conducted a more or less one-man archaeological
dig, defying the elements, ignoring financial hardship, the dangers of
infection from virulent diseases that may lurk in the soil around the
hospital, the indifference of possible sponsors, and the disdain of
other archaeologists in his quest for knowledge.
His fixation is the hospital which stood on the top of Soutra Hill for
almost 400 years. It tended patients who came from far and near --
including King Edward II of England who was treated there in the
fourteenth century -- but was closed down in 1460 after, as Dr Moffat
says, the Master Stephen Fleming ''went renegade'' and was
excommunicated.
Today only a small stone-built crypt marks the middle of an area where
the buildings of the hospital once spread across hundreds of acres.
Trying to get him to explain what first brought him to the site that
dominates his life is almost impossible. It eventually emerges that he
was born 42 years ago in Workington, Cumbria; attended North London
Polytechnic where he studied environmental sciences and eventually took
his doctorate which was basically concerned with finding out whether
plants found on archaeological sites grew there naturally or were
imported. He also collated evidence about sites comparing the physical
and documentary remains.
He then spent a year lecturing at St Andrews, which was not a success
and left him with a scorn of donnish life. Meanwhile he had become
interested in medieval hospitals in Scotland.
Giving credit to the monkish practitioners of medieval medicine has
become a Moffat crusade.
''If you listened to medieval historians you'd think that the Middle
Ages was one huge craft fair, but it was much more than that. I want to
find out how ordinary people really lived, how their ailments were
treated, what was used as medicines . . . I want to give those old
healers the credit they are due.''
His enthusiasm for his project persuaded local landowners to give him
access to the site and 10 years ago he stuck his spade into the hilltop.
Today there is still only a gaping hole about 15 feet across to be seen.
''I have still not covered more than one thousandth of 1% of the
hospital area,'' he said sadly.
There is a well on the hospital site which Dr Moffat believes contains
bodies and they would yield valuable information if they were dug up.
But the well is 40ft deep and would require propping up with steel
piles, ''and that's out of the question because of the expense,'' he
said.
Some pharmaceutical companies have given him money or equipment, like
a life-long supply of barrier gloves.
Other patrons supply help, financial or otherwise. He has a team of
part-time assistants and co-operation from others all over the world.
He admits, however, that sometimes ''he gets a bit desperate'' when
faced with the magnitude of his task. Part of his desperation stems from
a chronic lack of money.
So far he has produced four books detailing the history of the
hospital and the finds he has made there, and 3000 copies have been sold
at #6 a time. When he gives his open days, however, he does not charge
admission and refuses to ask for money from the hundreds of people who
attend.
The result is that Dr Moffat, in his own words, has ''sailed close to
the wind'' financially for a long time, so close that if ''something
doesn't turn up within five years,'' his project might have to be
abandoned.
That would be a great pity. Anyone who attends a Soutra Hospital open
day cannot help but be impressed by Dr Moffat's charismatic enthusiasm
and understand how he inspired Joan Smith to do her paintings.
Perhaps one day his work will be completed and he will receive
recognition for starting it in the first place but at the rate things
are going, he is unlikely to live long enough to see that happen.
The next Soutra Open Days are August 26, 27 and 28. The site is a
mile-and-a-half up the hill on the Gilston Road, off the A68 south of
Pathhead. Dr Moffat says people should turn up at 2pm prompt, because
once he gets started on his gripping tale, he does not want to have to
backtrack for late arrivals.

TRYING to portray the Labour Party as occupying moral high ground is
no easy task. A B Robertson's attempt is doomed to fail because he
relies on ill-founded smears against the Liberal Democrats as the basis
of his case (August 1).
The parties' attitudes to the drugs issue during the Littleborough and
Saddleworth by-election provide an interesting basis on which to make a
comparison.
The Labour candidate adopted an unimaginative and Conservative, ''hard
line on law and order'', approach. Then he tried to smear his opponent.
The Liberal Democrat bravely held his ground, insisting that we cannot
go on treating a large portion of our younger people as criminals.
In his victory speech, Chris Davies, the new MP, repeated his call for
a Royal Commission to examine all the issues involved. In this he has
been supported by the Chief Constable of Manchester.
Labour claimed it would win Littleborough and Saddleworth. The Liberal
Democrat won. Labour claimed it would win Eastleigh. The Liberal
Democrat won. Labour claimed it would win Perth and Kinross. It failed
there too.
Blair and Prescott claim there are no ''no go'' areas for Labour. What
they overlook is that there are many ''no win'' areas for the Labour
Party.

IN his analysis of the two special advisers appointed by the Scottish
Secretary, George Birrell is altogether too kind to all concerned, but
where he really falls down is in the metaphors he chooses (July 29).
Given their high-profile political defiance he says they will be ''as
invisible as the Scott Monument''. He could have added that, despite its
present vexations, we can be fairly sure it will be there after the
General Election.
He goes on to compare their ''acerbity and wit'' with Marks and Gran,
who wrote the series The New Statesman.
Another analogy would be the Marks and Gran creation Birds of a
Feather in which a comic duo squabble amicably until asked to give
succour and advice to the slut next door.

A B ROBERTSON'S letter is just plain nonsense (August 1).
David Steel's commitment to home rule for Scotland has never wavered.
Liberals have always championed a Scottish parliament elected by a fair
voting system. It is ''new'' Labour which has ditched English devolution
and is trying to backtrack on Scottish devolution and policies to
promote women for Parliament.
Liberal Democrats held an independent inquiry into allegations of
racism in Tower Hamlets, published the results, implemented all the
recommendations, and expelled two members. Labour's inquiry into its
racism in Tower Hamlets was held internally and its results have never
been published. We tackled the issue, did Labour?
Tony Blair has talked of a ''new'' kind of politics. In Littleborough
and Saddleworth this was to use dirty tricks and personal attacks. If Mr
Robertson and ''new'' Labour think that is what politics is about, it is
a little wonder they keep failing to win by-elections.
There is now the biggest elected Liberal force in local and national
government for at least 60 years because we fight elections on the
issues and do not run smear campaigns.

IN George Robertson's interview he said: ''The West Lothian question
is a red herring . . . The Northern Ireland framework document which
proposes a 90-strong assembly for Northern Ireland doesn't mention at
all reducing the voting power of Northern Ireland MPs or their numbers
in the Westminster Parliament'' (July 31).
Is Mr Robertson saying that, since no-one asks the West Belfast
question, its West Lothian equivalent is also irrelevant?
However, when Northern Ireland was governed by the Stormont
Parliament, Labour did ask the West Belfast question.
For example, speaking during Prime Minister's Questions in advance of
a Commons debate on steel, the late Harold Wilson, who had a majority of
just four at the time, said: ''I am sure the House will agree that there
is an apparent lack of logic for example, about steel, when Northern
Ireland can, and presumably will, swell the Tory ranks tonight when we
have no power to vote on questions about steel in Northern Ireland''
(House of Commons, May 6, 1965).
In those days, of course, the Tories at Westminster could rely on the
strong support of Northern Irelands Unionist MPs.
In the tight circumstances of 1964-66, Labour clearly resented the
implications of the West Belfast question, and stand guilty of hypocrisy
in dismissing its Scottish variant as a red herring.
Indeed, since Scotland has six times the number of MPs as devolved
Northern Ireland had with a future Labour government doubtless relying
on Scots for its majority, the West Lothian question is of far greater
significance than West Belfast ever was or will be again.

I cannot allow to go unanswered Mr Nicol's letter (August 1). It is
regrettable that the council's work in Airdrie goes largely unmentioned
in the heat of Monklands-bashing.
It should be recognised that commercial development is outwith the
council's control. Land ownership, commercial opportunity, and market
forces play the dominant role.
We can, however, facilitate developments and have done this
successfully at Graham Street, Bank Street, and at Stirling
Street/Wellwynd, in addition to a number of derelict land reclamation
projects. In those areas where the council has an element of control,
either in land or property ownership, there have been significant
achievements in Airdrie and more are in the pipeline.
The council over the past five years has constructed two excellent
community centres at Clarkston and Gartlea and a new library at at
Petersburn, has developed car-parking in Airdrie town centre, and
contributed to the innovative and effective closed-circuit television
monitoring of the town centre.
Council land has been sold to developers for the construction of a
large number of new private houses.
Thousands of council houses in Airdrie have been rewired, double
glazed, and provided with central heating; Milton Court has been
effectively overclad as has Pentland Court which also has a concierge
system for the security of tenants. New sheltered housing has been built
at two town-centre sites.
Small factory units have been constructed for industrial development.
Council offices have been improved for the use of citizens. The
Monklands Leisure Centre, Airdrie, is much improved, as is the
prestigious Sir John Wilson Town Hall, which had improvements at the
time of the Airdrie Mod. Next year the new John Smith memorial
swimming-pool will be open.
These are some of the recent projects which immediately spring to mind
and are demonstrations of the council's commitment to all of its
citizens. It is unfortunate that the more positive side of Monklands has
been ignored as there is much to be proud of in our towns and villages.

IF IT was the Bank of England's intention to strengthen the case for
an early rise in interest rates by its latest quarterly inflation
report, it has signally failed to do so. The Chancellor of the
Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, whose political standing has been blighted by
his inept handling of the taxation of executive share options, has been
lucky over his decision in May to rebuff the Governor of the Bank of
England over interest rates. Then the indications that the economy was
slowing down were thin on the ground, and Clarke seemed to be acting on
instinct. His party had just taken a drubbing in local elections, and
the instinct for survival was uppermost in his mind. For whatever reason
he decided to stay his hand when all the pundits favoured a rate hike;
subsequent events have apparently justified his stand. Activity is
slowing down from the hectic pace of last year, and while the recovery
is in little danger of falling off the cliff, the domestic economy has a
sickly look about it, nowhere more so than in the housing market where
prices are again falling.
The Old Lady of Threadneedle Street has been wrong-footed by the
slowdown. It still thinks the Government will fail to meet its target of
getting inflation down to 2.5% or less by the end of the current
Parliament. But inflation is now expected to peak at a lower level next
year. Bank projections point to inflation coming within the target range
in the second half of 1997. This does not put much pressure on the
Chancellor to relent and thank Eddie George for being right all along.
Forecasting inflation two years ahead is a very inexact science, which
makes the specific nature of the Government's target unnecessarily
restrictive. The Bank could be right that the nation may have to pay the
price for not raising rates three months ago through the need for even
dearer money in the future. But now that the economy is pausing for
breath an untoward rise would inflict further damage on the sectors of
the economy which are not benefiting from sterling's further devaluation
this year. The time to raise rates will come if the evidence points to
the pause having been a temporary blip of the kind that has been seen
before in most business cycles. In that sense the good-humoured dispute
between Clarke and George is becoming increasingly academic and
incomprehensible to wide sections of the public.

RICHARD Ashdown is to be congratulated on his letter on Monklands
District Council (July 29) -- without prejudice, very matter-of-fact, no
hint of sleaze, etc, it was a credit to all concerned.
As a member of the Monklands, both towns, for a long number of years,
I have been grieved to see the way the honest hardworking population of
both towns has been subjected to abuse from all shades of opinion.
Here is a community that lives a quiet reasonable life with its
neighbours suddenly pitchforked into a storm of abuse, rumours, etc,
magnified in most cases, things that existed in the area since I came 80
years ago and no-one bothered till recently.
If there were a bit more commonsense in the discussion about Monklands
District Council we might have a different perspective.

I AM writing about James Traynor's article (July 31) on the impudent
gesture of Paul Gascoigne in the match against Steaua Bucharest.
I would have been blissfully unaware that this incident had ever
occurred had it never appeared in print. If Paul Gascoigne is serving to
''fuel the hatred'' (in the words of James Traynor) of a religious
divide, aren't he and his colleagues fanning the flames by highlighting
this trivial act in newspapers?
As to the implications of the act itself, I am curious to know why
season upon season of Celtic players genuflecting and blessing
themselves (a ritual they appear to reserve for Old Firm encounters) is
never highlighted in his columns.
Almost everyone who lives in Glasgow knows the religious preferences
that predominate in the two big clubs. Why then are Rangers the only
club ever perceived to be bigots?

I AGREE with Jane Bunting's comments on the discrepancies in charges
levied on pensioners for the issue of a TV licence (July 31).
My grandson is about to sit his driving test and, if successful, will
for a single charge be issued with a licence which will carry him
through the next 52 years.
Having passed the age of 70 I now require to renew my licence every
three years at a cost of #6 per time and the reminder for this reached
me today.
I can appreciate the need for a declaration of health to enable me to
continue driving, but why should I be subjected to a triennial charge?
No doubt the DVLA will describe this as an administration charge, but
surely even a #1 increase in the thousands of ''indefinite'' licences
issued each year would cover any extra cost to the authority in dealing
with pensioners.

THE BOMB has been a constant in the lives of everyone for the past 50
years. As we approach the 50th anniversary of the explosion of that
first, crude device on Hiroshima the bomb is still with us and will
remain so, no matter what the outcome of the current and strangely
distorted post-Cold War dispensation. There are many questions which
need to be answered about the device which has hag-ridden nations and
peoples for so many years. Some are dealt with in our newspaper this
morning while others are being answered gradually by Cold War archives
which have only recently become available to scholars. We know that
Ernest Bevin insisted on having an atom bomb with ''the bloody Union
Jack on it''; what we did not appreciate was the degree of terror which
the bomb inspired in the international statesmen who brandished it to
such effect, but this is explicit in the records of summits in the
fifties.
The crucial question now is what role it must play in our lives in the
future. One of the developers of the British bomb wrote in 1951 that
possession of an atomic device was the discriminative test for a
first-class power. In fact the bomb did not save Britain as a
first-class power, but it clearly maintained our role as a power. To it
we probably owe our position as one of the five permanent members of the
United Nations Security Council; a place, as Sir Alec Douglas-Home used
to say, at the top table.
In international relations the British bomb probably made very little
difference, especially when set alongside the arsenals of the major
powers. Nevertheless we still have it, but to what end? At whom do we
point it, and does our enhancement through the Trident programme damage
the cause of non-proliferation? As with so many areas of our national
life there has not been sufficient discussion of this of late. There is
no reason why that examination should not be held now.

Tokyo, Wednesday -- Japan launched a new drive to tackle the yen's
rise by promoting the flow of Japanese capital abroad -- and was quickly
rewarded with a huge surge in the value of the dollar to a nearly
five-month high.
The surprise announcement of steps removing barriers to public and
private Japanese institutions' overseas investment and loans, combined
with Bank of Japan intervention, boosted the dollar to 90.00 yen, its
highest level since March 17.
Currency traders said they expected the dollar to go even higher in
the short-term, but some economists were cautious.
The measures included scrapping limits on insurers' participation in
syndicated loans and on their foreign currency loans to overseas
borrowers.
Also announced were steps to promote the flow of government funds
abroad through such means as actively disbursing loans to help
developing nations reform export-driven economies.
A senior Finance Ministry official said the moves would facilitate the
outward flow of Japanese capital -- a decline in which was a key factor
behind the yen's surge in recent months.
''If we can have a fair amount of export of capital, the exchange rate
would change,'' Eisuke Sakakibara, director-general of the ministry's
international finance bureau, told reporters.
The yen's rise has threatened to tip Japan's stalled economy into
recession. Tokyo's latest attempt to reverse it comes after an
aggressive push last month failed to boost the dollar to its near-term
target of 90 yen.
The fresh measures came ''just at the time when we don't have any
economic stimulus on the monetary or fiscal side coming through, and
secondly when . . . the very bullish dollar sentiment we saw a few weeks
ago was kind of waning,'' said Mineko Sasaki-Smith, senior economist at
Morgan Stanley. ''So this is a desperate attempt,'' she added.
Currency dealers said the steps would help boost the supply of yen and
ease the chronic dollar surplus, which has been a key reason for the
dollar's weakness and the yen's strength.
Some economists, however, were cautious about the long-term impact and
said it would take time to see whether Japanese institutions, many badly
burnt by the bursting of Japan's 1980s asset bubble and by the yen's
rise, were really prepared substantially to boost overseas investment.
If not, the persistently high level of Japan's current account
surplus, combined with low levels of outward capital flows might spell
continued yen strength, they said.
''We got into the situation in the first place because Japanese
investors were reluctant to purchase overseas assets,'' said Chris
Calderwood, economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd.
''Just tinkering at the margin of regulations . . . seems unlikely to
cause a massive sea-change overnight in the attitude of Japanese
investors toward foreign bonds.''
Some economists suggested the timing of the measures was prompted at
least in part by concern in the United States that Japan's financial
system woes might prompt Japanese investors to withdraw from US
financial assets. -- Reuter.

<HEADLINE>Bank of England less hawkish.  Report forecasts that inflation to peak at lower level.</HEADLINE>

THE Bank of England, the nation's inflation watchdog, is still
forecasting that the Government will miss its inflation target and is
keen that interest rates should be raised to avert this danger.
But its latest quarterly inflation report is not as hawkish as its
controversial predecessor in May, just after the Chancellor of the
Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, and the Governor of the Bank of England,
Eddie George, first fell out over the need for a rise in rates.
Then the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street was projecting an underlying
inflation rate of about 3% in 1997, significantly worse than the 2.5%
target set by the previous Chancellor of the Exchequer, Norman Lamont,
for the end of the current Parliament. It also argued that the risks to
its forecast were all on the upside. In other words it thought that
inflation would possibly turn out to be higher than it was forecasting.
Its latest forecast suggests that inflation will peak at a lower level
next year and concluded that ''it is more likely than not'' that
inflation will be above 2.5% in the middle of 1997. It is understood
that unpublished projections further into the future show inflation
continuing to decline.
Previously the Bank's projection covered eight quarters, but this has
now been extended to nine so that the forecast goes out to the quarter
two years from the report's publication date, in this case to the third
quarter of 1997. At the point inflation seems to be down to 2.5% or
less.
The Bank has clearly been surprised by the slowdown in the pace of
activity. It said: ''The projected peak in the inflation rate, reached
around the middle of 1996, is lower than it was in the May report,
largely because of the downward revision to estimated domestic demand in
the first half of this year and lower than expected nominal earnings
growth.''
Moreover, its inflation forecast is now subject to one downside risk
as well as an upside one. In the latter case, the risk is that
expectations of an accommodation of second-round effects of the fall in
the exchange rate will lead to upward pressure on domestically generated
inflation.
On the downside, a reversal of the recent rise in stockbuilding might
lead to a slowdown of growth and downward pressure on already subdued
domestic inflation.
The Bank is concerned about the recent growth in M4 money supply into
the top half of its 3% to 9% monitoring range for the first time since
the recession ended. But it notes that a temporary increase in monetary
growth could reflect borrowing by the corporate sector to finance
unintended accumulation of stocks and higher precautionary saving by
individuals.
The Old Lady returns to the theme of the dual economy with sharply
contrasting fortunes in the tradable and non-tradable sectors, and it
argues that this makes the dilemma for monetary policy more acute than
before.
''Time will resolve the puzzles about the strength in activity, money
growth, and domestic inflation. But the lags between changes in monetary
policy and their impact on inflation mean that decisions must be made
before the puzzles are fully resolved.
''The familiar danger is that delay in taking action could ultimately
result in interest rates having to go higher than would otherwise be the
case.''
Mr Clarke, is unlikely to find this very persuasive. He believes that
he was right about the economy slowing down when the Bank was still
taking a more bullish view.
The Bank does not seem unduly perturbed about the difference of
opinion between the Chancellor and the Governor. Both sides recognise
that the arguments are finely balanced. However, were the Chancellor to
persist in holding down interest rates in the face of widely recognised
arguments in favour of raising them then the Bank would be concerned
about the effects of the dispute on financial markets.
At this stage it is difficult to see how the matter will be resolved.
In the City the betting is that rates will not be raised until the final
quarter of the year at the earliest. The Chancellor will probably wait
for signs that activity is picking up again before changing his tune.
One surprising feature of the Bank's latest report was acknowledgement
of the demanding nature of the Government's inflation target of 2.5% or
less. The Old Lady pointed out that inflation had only been at or below
this level for about one fifth of the period since the Second World War.
It even drew attention to the fact that the 1% to 4% range was also a
demanding standard since even Germany had only met this just over half
the time.
Japanese boost
THERE would have been little controvery over rates this year but for
the inflationary pressures generated by sterling's decline, which was
approaching 6% this year when the Bank's report was being written.
The pound, however, was a substantial beneficiary yesterday of
overnight moves in Japan to relax regulations which had restricted
foreign investment by Japanese institutions.
The initiative boosted the dollar and the pound and set equity and
bond markets around the world alight. Japan's export-orientated
manufacturing sector has been severely disadvantage by the strength of
the yen. By encouraging local institutions to put more of their money
overseas, the authorities in Tokyo hope to knock the yen off its
pedestal. So far the strategy seems to be working.
The Tokyo stock market took heart from the initiative though Japanese
bonds, where returns are low compared with those which can be obtained
elsewhere, were hard hit.
London shared in the fun. Equities fed off gains in bond markets,
which could be the real beneficiaries of Japan's relaxation, at least in
the short run. At one time the FTSE-100 share index cleared 3500 before
settling for a gain of 50 points 3499.9. This leaves it within 20.4
points of its record close on February 2, 1994.
Sterling took heart from the dollar's new-found strength. Its
trade-weighted index advanced by 0.8 to 84.1. Its fall from grace this
year has now cost it 5% of its international value.
For its part the Bank of England report had little effect on markets
which were looking elsewhere.

THE seasonal shortage of news is no excuse for Ruth Wishart's maudlin
article about the three recent child murders (August 1). Silly,
sensational, sexist (''what mother, contemplating the . . . agonies of
Sophie's family''), it would not be out of place in a tabloid.
The facts -- Wishart offers us only reckless speculation -- are that
children (and for that matter adults) are much more likely to be
murdered by someone they know than by a stranger, and death as a result
of an accident is far more likely than either.
More importantly, in view of the misplaced nostalgia accompanying the
emotive discussion of these terrible crimes, there has been no increase
in recent years in the very small number of child murders by strangers.
''An entire generation'' will only be deprived of ''a childhood filled
with precious memories'' if parents allow themselves to be influenced by
Ruth Wishart and others equally irresponsible.
If she was writing in a state of hysteria, it was a serious error of
judgment. If not, she was guilty of profound cynicism.

I READ with interest Alan Hunter's article on sea safety (August 1).
Can I correct him on one important point?
The RNLI does not operate helicopters. The three helicopters mentioned
in the article are operated by HM Coastguard, and funded by the
taxpayer.
Our 215 lifeboat stations are supported entirely by public
contributions, and we neither seek nor receive any financial support
from the Government.
Having said this, there is an amicable relationship with the
helicopter crews, and both services have a valuable contribution to
make.
Last year our lifeboats were launched 6119 times and our volunteer
lifeboat men and women saved 1624 lives.

. . . in your ear, Michael. People like to think their views are heard

listen? The media don't wait to be asked for their opinions, of course.
Gerry calls them ''whingers with laptops''. A sharp pen, indeed, though
something of an exponent of the literary version of road rage. Advisers
are all very well, but they're plugged into the Central Belt and have
their own agendas which are not necessarily yours. For instance, has
Warner Meek Productions said anything about the row over the ferries to
Orkney and Shetland?
Your predecessor commissioned KPMG accountants to survey the routes,
but he locked the report in the vaults and refused to publish any of it.
Despite that he made some proposals which everyone assumed were in the
report. Luckily he didn't call for the privatising of Cal-Mac; everyone,
including KPMG, knew that would be crazy. Instead he took away the
freight subsidies to Orkney and Shetland, which was good news for P&amp;O
which has the route, and bad news for the small firms which compete. The
Vikings don't like it. They're worried sick about their economies, they
want Cal-Mac to run their services, and they know that P&amp;O gets a bigger
subsidy than Cal-Mac for operating only four ships against Cal-Mac's 32.
They also know that KPMG suggested a Cal-Mac-type service for the north
and that Cal-Mac has been forbidden to tender for it.
What to do? The report is leaking like a sieve. Publish it and you
won't be damned. Open up the debate. If P&amp;O is really that good, prove
it. If not, let Cal-Mac have a go. That's what listening (and good
government) is all about.

JEAN MONTGOMERIE complains about finding only newspapers belonging to
the Murdoch Group in a supermarket (July 31).
If she had visited a newsagent's shop she would have been offered the
full selection of news titles available in the market place.
She would not have been able to select a good selection of food in the
newsagents, but she could find whichever paper she desired.
The Government in its desire to open up the market to create more
competition has increased the costs dramatically of the traditional
outlets for newspapers.
We are required to obtain our supplies from two distributors, paying
delivery charges to both, if we wish to make available the full
selection of papers.
The whole principle of the local area being serviced by two competing
newspaper wholesalers has been lost in the negotiations between the
publishers and the trade distributors.
The fragmentation of the retail trade looks set to continue unless
there is a dramatic rethink by all parties concerned.
The Murdoch newspaper companies are in too much of a dominant position
in a wide variety of ways and your correspondent is right to question
the motives of the present leader of the main Opposition party when
''supping with the devil''.

ON the day that the influential Halifax house price index showed that
seasonally-adjusted house prices fell for the fifth consecutive month,
Tarmac has had enough and has decided to withdraw from housebuilding.
The decision follows a strategic review of the group, which will now
concentrate on and develop its activities in heavy building products,
including aggregates, building materials and services; overseas
contracting, professional services and the Government's private finance
initiatives.
At its annual meeting in June, the company said that although this
year it expected to sell more houses than last year, it was also
expecting to see continuing pressure on selling prices and margins, in
what remains a disappointing market.
However, yesterday, group chief executive Neville Simms said the
current depression in the housing market was largely irrelevant and that
the growth potential in Tarmac would come from interlinking the other
businesses. ''There is much less relationship between them and a
consumer product-type business like house building, which is also very
cash hungry,'' said Mr Simms.
Tarmac's housing division was formed in 1974 following the
acquisition, in 1973, of John McLean &amp; Sons, the Wolverhampton-based
house building business.
Since then Tarmac has grown to be the UK's second biggest
housebuilder, with 16 operating companies. McLean Homes Scotland, based
in Paisley, operates in central region, Strathclyde and Lothian. It
currently has 13 operational sites and employs 86 people. The housing
division as a whole employs over 2000 people.
Tarmac has been in the intensive care ward for some time. It has
undergone major restructuring over the past three years, aimed at
reducing debt and restoring profitability.
This latest restructuring is aimed at achieving a better balance for
the group in terms of geography and markets. The board believes that its
latest strategy offers attractive long term growth and profit
opportunities, and will provide Tarmac with a higher quality earnings
stream and an improved cash profile.
Last year, Tarmac's housebuilding division made an operating profit of
#64.3m on turnover of #485m. Just over 6,000 units were sold at an
average selling price of #80,100. At the height of the consumer boom in
the 1980s, Tarmac was selling 12,000 units.
Tarmac is considering its options for the housebuilding division,
although given the current depressed state of the housing market and the
size of the business, it is difficult to see another builder coming
forward as a purchaser.
A joint venture is possible or a flotation, which City analysts
estimate could value the business at #400m.

Are two dangerous subversives poised to make a comeback? Might Noel
Edmonds be leading us up the garden path? David Belcher unearths the
facts.
YOU may not hitherto have regarded Bill and Ben, the Flowerpot Men, as
dangerous television subversives. Nor looked upon Noel Edmonds as a
broadcasting visionary. However, these beliefs may gain common currency
should Edmonds be successful in acquiring the rights to an ancient cast
of children's television characters.
Having successfully invented tabloid telly with such shows as Late
Late Breakfast and Noel's House Party featuring the socially inept Mr
Blobby, Noel Edmonds now aims to resuscitate the dormant TV careers of
Bill and Ben (last active in 1971), the Clangers (1978), and the Magic
Roundabout (1984).
But if thirty-something comedian Bruce Morton is right, Noel will have
his work cut out, patricularly with the Flowerpot Men. ''Noel should put
his money where his mouth is and stick Bill and Ben head-to-head with
the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers. They wouldn't last 10 seconds.
Today's kids want high-speed action and ultra-violence.
''So do adults. In fact, anyone old enough to remember the era of the
Flowerpot Men will tell you they always preferred the Woodentops. Bring
back Spotty Dog now!''
The man behind the radical Bill-and-Ben-are-subversive theory is
self-confessed big fat ginger bloke Phil McCool -- and those aren't his
sole credentials, incidentally. Phil's also a noted radio scriptwriter
and director of Glasgow theatre company Big Stramash.
''Think about it,'' says Phil. ''Two flower-powered geezers. In pots.
Hanging out with a dodgy character called Weed who's got a one-word
vocabulary: 'Wee-ee-ee-eed'. Both these geezers wobble about all the
time. Neither of them can stand up straight. Neither of them ever
manages to utter a recognisable syllable . . . Flobalobalobalob, this is
the formless drooling of the cannabis user. Or at least that's what I
was like after I once smoked a couple of marijuana cigarettes.
''Plainly, Noel Edmonds has gone for Bill and Ben because he's
cleverly spotted drug culture's popularity with young people.''
Another aspect of Bill and Ben's telly resurrection was yesterday
identified by Ken Garner, lecturer in the department of language and
media at Glasgow Caledonian University. ''There's been a recent vogue
for TV shows which reinterpret aspects of older TV programmes from the
presenter's own childhood,'' says Garner.
''And to be fair to Noel Edmonds -- something which sticks in the
throat, frankly -- he can claim some responsibility for first having
come up with this concept of media-nostalgia on his Radio 1
Sunday-morning show in the late seventies. That old kiddies' fave Listen
With Mother had just been dropped from Radio 4, and so Noel jokily
adopted it into his programme, which he presented, as he does now on
BBC1's Noel's House Party, from the Manor in Crinkly Bottom.''
Noel Edmonds: TV innovator . . . it speaks volumes about the sad state
of British TV light entertainment, doesn't it?
Garner presses on: ''More recently on TV there's been Danny Baker and
his trivia quiz show based on telly ads from the sixties. There's Nick
Hancock's Room 101, and when Jonathan Ross started off with The Last
Resort he used to feature people like Tom Jones as ironic guests, stars
from tacky variety shows he'd seen in his youth. I find it a disturbing
trend, actually.''
A depressing one perhaps, but disturbing? How?
''One day all these baby-boomer TV frontmen, Ross and Baker and
Hancock and Edmonds, will wake up in their mid-forties, decide they'd
like to have opinions on different, newer aspects of popular culture --
and they'll suddenly realise that they've missed the last 30 years'
worth. What are they going to fill their talk shows with then?
''Let's hope that someone, sooner rather than later, can direct them
to work by a contemporary animator like Nick Parks. I'm not sure if his
Wallace and Grommit films are intended for children or adults, but I do
know that The Wrong Trousers and A Grand Day Out are 10 times better
than the Flowerpot Men ever were.''
And you can now choose from an amusing range of Wallace and Grommit
greetings cards, T-shirts, lunchboxes and flasks into the bargain. Face
it, Noel: flowerpots aren't sexy merchandise.
But the final verdict on the reborn Flowerpot Men naturally belongs to
the fun-loving flowerpot persons responsible for The Beechgrove Garden,
BBC1's Thursday-night hardy annual. My phone call to the Aberdeen
offices of programme-makers Tern Television resulted in a pithy one-word
statement -- complete with accompanying exclamation mark -- from
producer Nick Ibbotson.
That word? You've guessed it: ''Flobalob!'' When it comes to
summarising the worth of Bill, Ben, Weed, and especially Noel Edmonds,
you can't say fairer than that.

Alan MacDermid reports on the demands of fund-holding on GPs
TO THE Government which introduced it, the extra cost of fund-holding
general practice is a price worth paying for the greater efficiency and
better responsiveness to patient needs which it brings in its wake.
To Labour MP Alan Milburn it is a #200m layer of red tape added to the
health service that would have been better spent on much-needed
operations.
To many doctors, it is a huge dollop creamed off from the NHS budget
to benefit a minority of patients.
Dr Brian Keighley, newly-elected chairman of the Scottish GPs
Committee of the British Medical Association, regards fund-holding as
divisive and sees part of his new job as trying to heal these divisions.
''The demands of fund-holding on partners' time has been dramatic.
Some are saying it is not a problem if you get the right staff, but it
does create a whole lot of extra work,'' said the Balfron GP.
''They need extra managerial staff with the skills to understand
information technology, budgeting, and forward planning.''
Equally, involvement by non-fundholders in health care commissioning
-- a machinery that gives them more say with health boards in what
services are provided -- has also cost extra work. The difference, Dr
Keighley points out, is that non-fundholders are not compensated for
that.
''Fund-holding is inequitable. There have been anxieties that some
patients have had better access to care and, and have been at an
advantage in fund-holding practices because of the extra staff in the
practices.
''We want to see everyone benefiting. I would like to see the jam
spread around a bit more.''
The sum Milburn was bandying about yesterday represents the extra cost
since 1990 of letting some GP practices run their own budgets and
commission their own operations for patients -- some #124m since 1990
for administrative costs and #77m for computer assistance.
The Scottish Office admitted yesterday that #9.28m was the bill for
this extra expenditure in Scotland, representing what they regard as a
modest 0.05% of the total NHS expenditure over the five years, #17.7
billion.
''It has been a worthwhile investment,'' said a spokesman.
''Fund-holding has cut waiting-lists, improved the use of drugs and
provided more and better services for patients.''
The Government claims 23% of the population in Scotland -- 1.1 million
patients -- are registered with fundholders. There are 700 fund-holding
GPs in 130 practices, grouped into 122 funds.
Where does the money go? It is clear that some of the work done by
fund-holders -- negotiating with trusts on behalf of their patients for
treatment -- simply replicates on a small scale what the local health
board does en bloc for the rest of the population.
Mr Robert McKerral, of accountants Bannerman, Johnstone and MacLay,
with 35 practices (fund-holding and non-fundholding) among their
clients, said: ''The real burden is in the doctor's time. They have to
get involved in negotiating contracts with hospitals.
''You have to have a fund-holding manager in to negotiate. It usually
results in a doctor having to sacrifice his time, and a locum will
replace him for, say, half-a-day a week.
''Practices need an administrative resource, someone there full-time
or part-time to help them with their budgeting and control of
expenditure. They need specialised computer technology.''
To allow the GPs to do it at no cost to themselves the NHS gives them
a management allowance of approximately #35,000, depending on the size
of the practice. That goes to the practice to spend on hiring people to
do the admin work related to being fund-holders -- stationery, for
example, and the practice can also claim certain computer reimbursement
or grants. If they buy a machine specifically for fund-holding they get
a grant for 75%, and 100% for any software.
''You have that extra tier of administrative cost. In the overall
context of the country's NHS costs you have an extra management tier
which was not there before,'' said McKerral. ''In the Government's eyes
that is the cost of achieving greater efficiency.
''A practice that is a fund-holder should not gain or lose through
being a fund-holder. The aim is that the Government reimburses them for
the time and cost of being fund-holders.''

Graham McKenzie meets Scot Jim Galloway, whose input has made
Toronto's Jazz Festival an event Glasgow should be envious of
ON A particularly hot afternoon several hundred normally-sane people
risk sunstroke courtesy of the du Maurier Ltd Downtown Jazz Festival,
Toronto. The occasion is a free concert outside the city hall in Nathan
Phillips Square, by the most distinctive of new jazz voices on piano --
Jacky Terrasson. For almost two hours we remain captivated and
enthralled by his fiery display of non-traditional ideas and virtuoso
daring. Beside me throughout stands one of the most accomplished and
respected -- certainly amongst his peers -- jazz musicians Scotland has
ever produced -- Jim Galloway. He also happens to be the artistic
director of the Toronto Jazz Festival.
At the Glasgow International Jazz Festival and again on-stage, in the
afternoon, I watched the Jacky Terrasson Trio perform a no-less
committed set. This time there were but a handful of converts, dotted
around the spacious caverns of the Old Fruitmarket. It is to the credit
of the musicians that they managed to create any sort of atmosphere at
all. They deserved better -- and so did we. Paradoxically, on the way to
the Fruitmarket I had passed through a packed Princes Square where local
saxophonist Laura MacDonald was recreating some of the spirit I'd felt
in Toronto for the benefit of a mix of shoppers and committed listeners.
I asked Jim Galloway how important he felt it was to the Festival as a
whole to be able to present a quality programme of free events.
''It is absolutely essential and something that will continue to
happen as long as I am director. This wonderful music must be accessible
if we are to keep it alive and attract new audiences. In essence it is
what separates a Festival from the mere presentation of a series of
concerts. I'm greedy and I want the audience to be greedy. I want to be
able to offer a varied menu to the people out there, and have them taste
it all.''
We are not talking about the odd token gesture here. This year, in
addition to Jacky Terrasson, the Festival presented free concerts by
former Prime Time guitarist James Blood Ulmer, the acid jazz of Medeski,
Martin and Wood and maverick tenor saxophonist David S Ware. In another
series of concerts at Rendezvous Air Canada you could, for a single
dollar, hear such luminaries as Lee Konitz, and master bassist Dave
Holland.
What intrigues is that Jim Galloway recognises this need for
accessibility in a place where there are five radio stations playing
jazz around the clock and in a city that is host to a number of
international jazz clubs such as Top o' the Senator. In Glasgow where do
we expect people to have heard the music of relatively new artists such
as David Sanchez?
It is not just the fact that Jim Galloway is a Scot that invites
comparison with the festival in Toronto. Both festivals were
nine-years-old this year and are held across a 10-day period. This year
there were some similarities in programming -- if not in pricing!
Verve records presented a showcase in both cities. In Toronto for a
single ticket charge of $25 -- incidentally the most expensive ticket in
the entire programme -- you could while away the whole evening to the
sounds of New Orleans trumpeter Nicholas Payton, Christian McBride
Quartet, and the ultimate bebop trombonist J J Johnson. In Glasgow you
required a separate ticket for a set apiece from Guy Barker and Roy
Hargrove, at a combined cost of #22 (or $44).
In Glasgow you could check out the home-grown talents of the Scottish
Jazz All-Stars at #10. In Toronto the finest Canadian players coming
together under the title of Boss Brass could be heard for the measly sum
of $1. Yet, if anything, the Toronto Festival has fewer resources and
indeed their director of marketing and communications Barb McCullough is
highly critcal of the lack of support from the Metropolitan Toronto
Council.
Jim Galloway was born in Dalry, Ayrshire, on July 28, 1936, where he
began playing clarinet in his teens. When I ask him about his early
influences he replies without hesitation.
''Joe Nigid! He was a disc jockey on the American Forces Network
coming out of Stuttgart. His theme tune was Nightmare by Artie Shaw. He
was on late during the week when I should have been asleep.''
It was while studying at art school in Glasgow that he played in his
first band run by Maryhill trumpet player Bill Miller. Further work
followed in the company of the Alex Dalgleish All Stars, before he
formed his own group, the Jazzmakers. He emigrated to Canada in 1964 to
be ''closer to the music''.
''The very first evening I spent in Toronto I wandered into this bar,
the Colonial Tavern, I'll always remember it. There's a stage and on it
is Herman Autrey, Vick Dickenson, and Buster Bailey!''
Despite an initial difficulty in transferring his union membership
from the Musicians' Union to the American Federation of Musicians, Jim
soon became a regular on the North American scene, teaming up with
former Clyde Valley Stomper Jim McHarg to form the Metro Stompers.
He became the artistic director for the du Maurier Ltd Downtown Jazz
Festival in 1986. ''I was asked to,'' he states simply. He still sees
himself primarily as a musician, however.
''These days I play mainly soprano and baritone sax, and lead several
groups including Jazz Canada and -- with a nod to my heritage -- the
'Wee' Big Band.''
When he is not playing or promoting the music his other passions
stretch to the restoration of vintage cars -- his current pride and joy
being a 1958 Mercedes -- and single malt whiskies, ''although not at the
same time''.
Canada has been good to Jim Galloway but perhaps not as good as Jim
Galloway has been for Canada. Before we parted he told me that he'd love
to come home and play the Glasgow Festival. Some of us would like him to
stay a little longer.

A DOLLAR-buying spree by the US monetary authority, the Federal
Reserve, led to a surge in the value of the American currency which fed
through to sterling.
The Bank of Japan joined the Fed in buying the dollar which rose
strongly against the yen after Japan announced measures to stem the rise
in its currency and deregulation plans to promote overseas investment.
The co-ordinated approach to stabilising currencies is expected to
continue at least for some time.
Sterling surged to 84.1 on a trade-weighted basis, a gain of 0.8 on
its overnight level, however, volumes were light with many dealers on
holiday. Against a popular dollar the pound was only marginaly higher at
$1.6003 but it jumped more than two and two-thirds pfennigs against the
German mark to DM2.2364.
The pound showed little reaction to a batch of UK economic data or to
the Bank of England's quarterly inflation report which rekindled the
idea that British interest rates may have to rise again.
Sterling continued to derive some benefit from an upbeat OECD report
on the state of the UK economy.

Chris Moncrieff examines the amorous and swashbuckling times of Lord
White, a tycoon who attracted the world's most beautiful women
BUSINESS tycoon Lord White, the suave escort of some of the world's
most beautiful women, is just the sort of swashbuckling, audacious and
daring entrepreneur adored by Margaret Thatcher.
His astonishing commercial acumen and reputation as a hell-raiser are
legendary. He is instinctively a shrewd striker of deals, and one of the
most feared corporate predators the world has ever seen.
It was his extraordinary association and friendship with
fellow-Yorkshireman Lord Hanson in building an industrial conglomerate
employing 80,000 people and worth #10 billion, and their reputation as
''corporate raiders'', which caused consternation in boardrooms across
Britain and the US.
His searing ambition was so great that England could not contain him.
In 1973, appalled by Edward Heath's Government of ''ghastly stop-go
policies'', White went to New York with just #3000 in his pocket. He was
soon to be dealing in billions as co-founder of the Hanson empire.
It was on his way back home to the USA from a holiday in London that
he was taken ill at the weekend with breathing difficulties. He is now
in intensive care in Los Angeles where the hospital yesterday described
his condition as ''serious but stable''.
Lord ''Gordy'' White of Hull, three times married, and who has proudly
squired some of the world's most desirable and famous women, indulges in
an exotic and opulent lifestyle. He has a personal fortune estimated
between #70m and #100m and sumptuous homes around the world.
Margaret Thatcher stood in awe of his entire approach to business, a
bold-as-brass risk-taker, embodying everything she regarded as virtuous
in the hard-nosed world of commerce. She rewarded him with a knighthood
in 1979, soon after she swept to power, and made him a life peer in her
resignation honours list.
Vincent Gordon Lindsay White was born in Hull on May 11, 1923, and
left boarding school at the age of 16, against the wishes of his father.
He got a job with a timber company in Hull, but resigned when he was
refused a rise after six months. White joined the Army and was
commissioned into the Pioneer Corps.
In India he was recruited by the Special Operations Executive and
joined Force 136, a secret organisation conducting clandestine warfare
in the Far East.
White confessed later: ''I liked clandestine operations because you
were more independent, more able to make your own decisions. Blowing up
bridges and railway lines was quite fun really.''
This remark summed up his entire approach to the boardroom and the
incredible business career that was to lie ahead. He became friendly
with James Hanson through Hanson's brother Bill, who died tragically in
1954. They quickly discovered they shared interests in fast cars,
horses, gambling, snappy clothes, and beautiful women -- particularly
beautiful women.
Their regular visits to Hollywood marked them out. White's blue and
black leather address book began to bulge with the names of some of the
world's most sought-after women. Gordy was soon dining out with
mega-stars like Ava Gardner and Grace Kelly, and later Liz Taylor, Kay
Kendall, Jean Simmons and Susan Hayward, to name but a few.
In his heyday, it has been said, this lean, 6ft 4in, highly eligible
bachelor used to change his girlfriends as often as his shirts.
Hanson was best man at White's first wedding in St Margaret's Church,
Westminster, in 1958 to Ann Elisabeth Kalen, a Swedish diplomat's
daughter. The marriage crumbled two daughters and 10 years later.
However, in 1974 he married an American actress, Virginia Northrop, once
Maid of the Month on the seventies' hit show The Golden Shot. They had
been dating for six years and she was seven months pregnant when they
wed.
Soon after the birth of their son this marriage began to founder and
by 1979 it was secretly dissolved in Bermuda where they shared a holiday
home and where he had bought his own burial plot.
The dating went on and on. Gordy was seen escorting the American model
Juliana Curran, followed by Mary Tyler Moore and Cheryl Tiegs. Then it
was Joan Collins, followed by American actress Shelley Smith. The
line-up was breathtaking.
It was in 1985 that he met his present wife, Victoria Tucker, 40 years
his junior. They were married quietly in Bermuda in 1992. But subsequent
events were not so quiet. She stormed out of their Los Angeles home
after he declared: ''Never marry a young girl. They only want babies.''
But some months later his words were forgotten and she was back at his
side, helping him convalesce after a hernia operation.
There was an incident, subsequently fiercely denied, where he was
accused of assaulting her. Victoria claimed her injuries were sustained
in a ski-ing accident, and the matter -- which had led to White's arrest
-- was dropped.
Meanwhile, his spectacular commercial activities went on apace. He
explained his reputation as a business predator with disarming virtue
and Thatcher-esque frankness.
''We did not become the fifth-largest company in Britain by asset
stripping,'' he insisted. ''There is a whole lot of rubbish talked about
short-termism by pundits promoted by management who are not capable of
managing. Companies are run to benefit shareholders. They are taken over
because of deficient management. A lot of companies lack new blood. They
become steeped in the culture of their business.''
His ambitions have always been boundless. He lost #8m on a bloodstock
investment, but apart from that, the White touch in business has been
the Midas touch. He was, as a staunch Conservative, also protective of
Thatcher -- and probably saved her career. In January 1986 it was Hanson
which emerged as the mystery buyer of shares in Westland Helicopters
when it was the subject of a political maelstrom which nearly forced her
to resign.
The world has rarely before seen such a seductive Casanova and dashing
tycoon combined into a single seemingly unstoppable dynamo. For him, not
even the sky is the limit.

celebrates 65 years in the movie business. FRANK McGROARTY flicks
through its history pages of success.
AT THE end of 1995, the movie industry celebrates its 100th
anniversary, but the Odeon cinema chain will be popping the champagne
corks a little earlier when it celebrates its 65th birthday tomorrow.
The Odeon has been synonymous with British cinema-going, right back to
its humble beginnings in 1930 when scrap dealer Oscar Deutsch opened the
first cinema in the Birmingham suburb of Perry Barr. Sixty-five years
on, it is now part of a multi-million-pound leisure industry with 186
multi-complex sites right across the UK with more than 400 screens.
Already this week its parent company, the Rank Organisation, has said
it wants to develop the former site of the Glasgow Garden Festival with
a #20m leisure complex. Hugh Corrance, managing director of Odeon
Cinemas, is enthusiastic about the company's future and added that there
are more developments planned: ''During the past 18 months we have
obtained approval for six new multi-development sites. We expect
approval for a further 10.''
When the Odeon started, it had to contend with competition from the
hundreds of provincial picture houses that were situated throughout the
country as well as established cinema chains like ABC and
Gaumont-British. But the ingenious Deutsch was able to expand his
organisation through acquisition and expansion, and it was only a matter
of time before he expanded to Scotland.
In 1938, Ayr, Glasgow, and Hamilton were among the first Scottish
Odeons to open their doors, and in 1939 the company had 300 cinemas
around the UK. It was about that time that J Arthur Rank came on the
scene and joined the board of directors. When Oscar Deutsch died in
1941, Rank was in control of the Odeon cinemas as well as the
Gaumont-British cinemas. In 1948 both networks were combined under the
control of the Circuit Management Association -- and by 1952 boasted 540
cinemas.
During the next 20 years, these numbers were greatly reduced due to
the birth of commercial television and many of the sites competing
against each other. The number of screens, however, increased, thanks to
the twinning and tripling of cinema buildings, a trend that all movie
theatres have adopted up to the present day.
During the recession of the early eighties, the audience figures began
to drop, but the trend changed in 1983 and has been on the up ever
since. In 1994 admissions in the UK exceeded 120 million; this was
double the 1985 figure.
Today the Odeon is as strong as ever and is already committed to
millions of pounds of expansion and upgrading throughout the UK despite
competition from television, video, and satellite. In Scotland the Odeon
in Edinburgh hit the headlines earlier in the year when it was the
location for the world premiere of Rob Roy with Liam Neeson.
''It was certainly the biggest premiere in the world this year,'' said
manager Grahame Wear. ''It was a very exciting evening.'' For Wear, who
has been in the Edinburgh hot seat since 1989, the launch of Rob Roy
gave him a second chance to meet up with Neeson again. ''We last met at
the premiere of The Big Man in 1992,'' he said. ''Since then he has been
transformed from unknown to superstar and it has not changed him at all.
He's still a very nice man.''
Across the years the Odeon cinemas have had their fair share of
premieres, stunts, and charity performances. These include a member of
staff in Edinburgh taking a bath of milk during the premiere of
Cleopatra in 1964 and the appearance of a Spitfire in the foyer during
the Scottish premiere of The Battle of Britain years later. ''We would
still do displays from time to time but nothing on that kind of scale,''
said Wear. ''Today time is money. To set up something like that would
take up a lot of man hours.''
Wear added that for a film to succeed these days it takes more than a
publicity or promotional stunt to get the customers through the doors.
''It has to have a good story as well as good acting,'' he said.
''Certainly the number of quality films have increased over the years.''
Like all cinema chains, the Odeon is keen to take advantage of new
computer technology available and the Edinburgh boss is convinced that
it will continue to play a part in the way we watch films in the future.
''I can see them developing a system that combines film and virtual
reality,'' he said.
As the Odeon organisation looks forward to the next 65 years it, like
other cinema chains, can be certain of a secure future because despite
the increased availability of movies to watch at home through TV, video
and satellite, most people still enjoy the experience of a night out at
the pictures.

THE proposed #16.2m acquisition of independent Glasgow-based
stockbroker Allied Provincial Securities by the parent company of Greig
Middleton, the terms of which were announced yesterday, will create the
largest private client broker in the UK.
Allied managing director Iain Mackay believes the company's takeover
by London-based King &amp; Shaxson will probably result in Glasgow becoming
home to the largest private client operation on one site in the UK. The
main competitor in Glasgow will be the independent Speirs &amp; Jeffrey.
King &amp; Shaxson, which revealed it was in talks in May, yesterday
announced it was offering up to 540 of its own shares, currently trading
at 124p, for every 100 held by Allied's management. Institutional
shareholders will receive up to 501 shares for every 100.
Between them, 108 Allied employees own 52% of the company.
The acquisition of Allied will create a stockbroker with about #7000m
of funds under management and nearly 50,000 private clients. The
combined operation will have another 28 UK offices.
Allied's back-office work, currently sub-contracted to Hambros, will
be brought back in-house on August 20 and merged with Greig Middleton's
settlement operations.
Back-office work will be amalgamated on one site, with the same
applying to private client management. While these functions may be
split between the current bases of Allied and Greig Middleton, they may
ultimately come together under one roof.
Allied chairman Bernard Solomons, Mr Mackay and deputy chairman David
Lawrence are to join King &amp; Shaxson's board.

SARA VILLIERS looks at a community-based theatre group's latest
offering
THE tale of a deformed Englishman, alternatively ostracised and then
leonised by Victorian society seems a strange choice for a Highland
theatre's first foray into community drama. But Keiran Gillespie, Drama
Artist in Residence at Eden Court Theatre in Inverness, is confident
that the story of John Merrick, The Elephant Man, is the perfect choice
for this venture.
He reasons that the majority of productions which tour the Highlands
are about a specifically Scottish experience, and while he applauds the
reflection of a community's own experiences and history, he is adamant
that there must also be scope for something different.
Thus, when Paul Morrell succeeded Catherine Robins as director at Eden
Court and determined that there would be a stronger focus on Outreach
work, Gillespie organised a touring production of John Godber's
Teechers.
The Elephant Man is the next stage of Morrell's proposed process of
involving locals in theatre and encouraging them to exploit its
extensive resources. ''The idea is not just to involve people as
audiences but also as participants,'' explains Gillespie. ''It's a
tentative beginning as we simply don't have the background in community
work that for example, Dundee Rep or Cumbernauld Theatre have.''
But Gillespie himself has experience in that area, having worked as
Assistant Director to Alan Lyddiard on the first year of Dundee Reps
successful Witches Blood project, and having worked on a large-scale
piece involving the youth theatre at the Everyman in Liverpool. He
claims the first priority is to find a story which involves a large
number of people ''in a meaningful way''. ''We were looking for a
poignant, emotional story. The Elephant Man is about how Victorian
society treated outcasts so we've been able to cast people as
pick-pockets, orphans, and circus performers -- clowns, acrobats,
fortune-tellers and strong men.''
Eden Court was overwhelmed by the initial response to a newspaper ad
for volunteers. Gillespie showed up at a meeting and was astonished to
be faced by 130 eager faces. Inevitably, numbers dropped off and 50
people are involved, with almost 30 in the cast.
The play features one professional actor, the young Joel Strachan, who
recently featured in Pen Name Theatre's production of The Fall of the
House of Usher.
Strachan plays Merrick but, unlike John Hurt who played him in the
film version, he does not intend to closet himself in the make-up room
for hours.
''Joel isn't using any make-up at all. Instead he studied Merricks'
disabilities in detail, and sometimes he's in a wheelchair. I'm very
pleased with what he's doing. It's a very emotional performance and
people have even been crying in rehearsals,'' says Gillespie, adding
hastily ''for the right reasons''. He stresses the play has comic
moments too.
For Gillespie the most pleasing aspect of the production has been that
during the quiet summer season the building has suddenly come alive.
''Usually at this time of year it looks very pretty, but very empty.
Obviously it can be busy during the conferences which take place here
but just now there is a buzz which is a local buzz. You can't beat
that.''

SCOTTISH connections, past and present, abounded last night in the
Royal Albert Hall Prom that featured the world premiere of Sally
Beamish's Viola Concerto.
Beamish, of course, lives in Scotland and is a prominent member of the
music community here. The London Mozart Players' music director,
Matthias Bamert, who conducted the premiere, is a former conductor of
the Royal SNO. And violist Philip Dukes, who commissioned and performed
the concerto, spent much of last season in Scotland playing principal
viola in the BT Scottish Ensemble.
The concerto is a beauty that seems to contain -- on first hearing --
a strange flaw. I'll come to that in a minute. It's a concerto of
denial, a descriptive piece in one movement, tracing the triple denial
of Christ by the apostle Peter -- the latter role taken by the solo
viola, who plays almost continuously. There's a personal element too, as
the composer recalls her oft-told period of denial as a busy viola
player on the London scene, aching all the while to compose.
Brilliantly crafted, with the clarity of texture associated with
Beamish's work, the concerto is a soulful, lyrically expressive piece.
The viola, as Peter, treads a haunted path -- plaintive, melancholic,
anguished, remorseful -- through a jostling, harassing, interrogatory
crowd. Philip Dukes's playing -- especially in the sad, luminous close
-- was gorgeous and full, Bamert's direction as lucid as one might
expect.
And the apparent flaw? Brevity. It's an awfully short work. I was just
getting into it when it was over. The sighing coda felt like a slow
movement with more to follow. Another hearing will test that impression.

Theatre
IT IS not as if she had no competition. Vanessa Samuels's tender but
strong, innocent but brave Princess Irene was so accomplished pantomime
producers should be beating a path to her door. Her beau, Kevin Lennon,
was a doughty freedom fighter complete with the accent. As goblin prince
Krankl, Bram Gieben has not only a name that defies any Equity
interference but a made-for-the-part shorn and be-quiffed hairdo, and
threatening manner to match. His stage parents, Lesley Colquhoun and
Jason Hain, could double-handedly breathe life into the expiring corpse
of variety theatre. And as for Penny Hodgett's wordless performance as
Fannon the dragon -- the unwon heart in the first night audience must
have been made of stone.
But none the less Victoria Johnston's wildly over-the-top Banshee (a
cameo role clearly written with Fenella Fielding in mind) all but stole
the show. With one hoarse cackle (Ms Johnston was helpfully struggling
with a summer cold, in common with a few other members of the cast), she
placed an uncertain production firmly in a sword-and-sorcery genre,
allowing it to coast easily to its conclusion through the succession of
whatever-next terrors that faced our heroes.
This Scottish Youth Theatre show is directed by Raymond Short, himself
an SYT ''graduate'' and no stranger to pantomime. However it is great to
see a Stuart Paterson play (full of wisdom, gently put) produced outwith
the Christmas season ghetto, complete with live music and a fine set
from Fin McLay (with real turf!).
Take the kids to the Saturday matinee, and don't worry that one of the
engines of the plot is an oblique reference to shrimping.

A NEW lifeboat for Stornoway, due to be dedicated on August 14, has
been sent back to the hull builders Green Marine of Lymington,
Hampshire, after some blisters developed on her hull in sea trials.
Training for the Stornoway crew has now been postponed. A spokeswoman
for the Royal National Lifeboat Institution in Dorset said last night:
''The Will is the very first production of the new fast Severn class. I
suppose we expected some teething problems.'' The 17-metre boat is

NEVER has it been more true that you should not take anything for
granted, and that nothing is certain apart from death.
For example, there was a time not so long ago when, if you bought your
flat or house, you could be fairly sure of selling it when you wanted --
and at a tidy profit. Those days appear to have gone forever, with
housing market activity still too weak to push up prices in all but a
few isolated districts. This means that negative equity and
repossessions will continue to be a problem for tens of thousands of
people for the forseeable future.
Then there are the many thousands of women who spend every month
worrying about whether they are pregnant or not. Given the apparent rise
in the level of both female and male infertility, those worries may be
pointless. This was amply illustrated by recent research suggesting that
the high level of chemicals in the environment may be to blame for the
steep decline in male fertility. The scores of man-made chemicals in
plastics, detergents, electronics and pesticides which mimic the action
of the female hormone oestrogen are to be investigated.
One has always assumed that the moment you stop using contraception
you are bound to become pregnant immediately. While this may be the case
for some people it appears to be much harder to get pregnant when you
actually want to.
Being in my early thirties, I have several friends in their late
twenties and early thirties who are trying to have a baby. To those of
us who have yet to take the plunge, the concept of trying to become
pregnant to no avail is a new and disturbing one. Yet one friend has
been trying unsuccessfully for seven months, another for three years.
I am not sure how long, on average, it takes to get pregnant, but
people suggest that six months seems to be the point when natural
patience runs out and mechanical techniques take over. So temperatures
are taken, charts plotted, and visits made to the doctor. Meanwhile we
chip in with helpful hints and old wives' tales. Surely it must happen
on holiday, all that sun, sea, and . . .
Uncertainty is a key factor affecting today's workplace. There is no
such thing as a job for life irrespective of what profession one cares
to consider. Having a degree no longer guarantees employment of any
kind, let alone in areas traditionally viewed as appropriate for
graduates. Although pressures may be easing in the graduate labour
market, it is still the case that new graduates often have to start work
onthe bottom rung of the job ladder. For instance, many wanting to work
in popular fields like the media acquire typing skills and then use
these as a way to wangle their way into their chosen company, with the
hope of securing a more appropriate role at a later date.
Many more graduates are also working part-time and on a temporary
contract basis. This can be a useful way of securing a full-time job as
many employers often prefer appointing someone they have worked with on
a temporary basis to going through the costly exercise of advertising
for and interviewing potential employees.
It is not so much education that is the passport to a good job and
career prospects as is the possession of useful employment skills, like
computer literacy, leadership skills and the ability to communicate
effectively.
Paradoxically, many professional women are giving up their careers in
their thirties when they decide to start a family. They are increasingly
finding that, contrary to what the popular women's magazines would have
us think, it is not possible to have it all; career, long-term
relationship, children, and happiness. The recipe of how to achieve a
successful balance remains a secret for many women.
There is only so much change that people can handle at any one time.
The decline in traditional role models for young men, given the rise of
single mothers and increased female employment, is one factor attributed
to the sharp increase in suicides among males under 25.
A desire for a quieter life with a period of policy stability has been
cited as one of the reasons for the unpopularity of the present Tory
Government. Given the unsettling environment in which we live, is it any
wonder that the feel-good factor is conspicuous by its absence?

THE Italians are great ones for gestures. Outside every little Tuscan
village, or so it seemed driving round last week, is the proud boast
that it is a nuclear-free zone -- a triumph of hope over reality if ever
there was. If Citta di Scampi is a nuclear-free zone, but Castello di
Chips next door is not, nothing is going to be safe in one should an
atomic bomb be dropped on the other, but the assertion of nuclear
freeness, a hangover from the days of the Cold War, served to remind
those fighting it that ordinary people had views of their own. In
practical terms it was a futile claim, but in terms of making a
political point the assertion ''We are nuclear-free folk'' had some
value.
There is always something to be said for reminding the decision takers
that they do not necessarily know what is best. John Major, for
instance, once had thoughts about traffic cones which no sane person
would have harboured. As for his railway charter, had he spent the
amount of time waiting for his last train, as I did on Sunday night on
my way home from Italy, without a word of explanation from whoever is
responsible for trains in these complicated pre-privatised days, it
would go the same way as the cones one.
But then he never does have to wait on something so mundane as a
train. The RAF jet is at his beck and call, the Prime Ministerial
limousine stands, engine purring ready for a quick getaway, wherever he
goes. Tory politicians are not singular in this respect, of course.
Barbara Castle, when Minister of Transport, was once late for a Commons
debate because her car got stuck in a London traffic jam at Marble Arch.
Had she got out and taken the tube she could have arrived on time, but
it never crossed her mind.
I learned about the demise of the traffic cone charter on Monday
because, as well as spending the past fortnight in a nuclear-free zone,
I spent it in a newspaper-free zone. A dreadful confession for any
journalist to make, perhaps, but I discovered life without newspapers
goes on rather nicely.
Not that I am advocating you do without them for the entire
twelvemonth -- my holidays depend on you reading this particular one
regularly -- but what is the point of going abroad and reading the
papers from home? Holidays are times for change, and since the San
Sepolcro newsagent does not get English language newspapers it is an
easy change to make. I suppose I could practise my Italian by reading
their papers, but one should practise one's foreign languages on the
natives -- you learn so much more that way.
When I looked at the papers again the Croats, Serbs, Bosnians, and all
those well-intentioned folk at the United Nations and in the relief
agencies were making a hash of things in the former Yugoslavia exactly
as they were when I left, so I had not missed much.
I had, however, to think of other ways to fill my time when not
sightseeing. The farmhouse had no television and the BBC World Service
proved elusive. I did paint five ghastly water colours of the steading
which I treasure because, like nuclear-free zones, they are an
expression of hope over achievement, proof that anybody can do anything,
even if not particularly well.
And I read the Penguin History of Latin America by Professor Edwin
Williamson of the chair of Hispanic Studies at Edinburgh, a fascinating
and revealing book. Maybe the Latin Americans were lucky in that when
they embarked on their wars there was no television, no United Nations,
and no outside interest in what they were up to because it was a bloody
time which would, had it been today, have hogged the newspaper headlines
and dominated CNN as we contributed troops to a Latin American Unprofor
and the pundits rabbited on about how badly behaved they all were down
Argentine way.
Kate Adie, Martin Bell, and their ilk would have been there,
microphones at the ready, camera and sound man attached at the hip,
Siamese triplet-style, to bring us The Chaco Wars between Paraguay and
fought in the 1930s with Bolivia over some non-existent oil fields at a
cost of 50,000 lives.
The earlier wars of liberation after the Spanish empire collapsed
leaving a political vacuum which it has proved difficult to fill even
yet, also cost thousands of lives. But they could all have happened on
the far side of the moon as far as the rest of the world was concerned
then. Today they are forgotten.
Horrid things are undoubtedly happening in the Balkans, but nothing
new is taking place and I have an awful feeling that knowing about it
does no good. The collapse of Tito's communism in Yugoslavia left a
political vacuum nobody has managed to fill, just as the disappearance
of the Spanish monarchy left the Latin Americans struggling to find
political systems to replace it which commanded similar respect from the
people, a failure which resulted in those terrible wars.
I had always assumed, having been taught an imperial view of history,
that Latin America's misfortune was to have been colonised by the
Spanish, not by the likes of we Britons who plant baby Parliaments
wherever we go, which is not like it was at all.
As one ambles round Tuscany admiring the castles of the Montefeltri,
the pile at San Leo where Cagliostro died in his cell, or the Castello
d'Orcia, one forgets they were not built as tourist attractions but as
war machines. Tuscany may be awash with Tory MPs with second homes and a
taste for Chianti, but it was not ever thus.
Being without newspapers puts what you read in them in perspective,
which is not to say one should do without them, just that one should
read something else on holiday -- like some history. Lady Thatcher could
learn a thing or two from Professor Williamson's account of Argentina's
past, but she, having made history, now rewrites it.

THE taunt that many leading Tories are heading for the ''Chicken Run''
-- looking for seats that are safer than their present abodes -- is one
that the Labour Party will play for all it's worth. You can almost feel
the humbug oozing from Mr Frank Dobson as he does his well-known Uriah
Heep impression. Yet perhaps not everyone on the Opposition benches will
join in the clucking.
We may not hear a cheep on the subject from the Shadow Foreign
Secretary, the Rt Hon Member for Livingston, Mr Robin Cook, currently
stomping the country in an attempt to persuade us that his party is
composed entirely of Euro-enthusiasts. Once upon a time, indeed between
the years 1974 and 1983, roving Robin was the representative in the
House for Edinburgh Central.
Along came that wicked quango, the Boundaries Commission, which
promptly merged Edinburgh Central with North Edinburgh, then held by the
redoubtable Alex Fletcher, a much-missed Tory who could slug it out with
the best of them. Did Mr Cook stand his ground, fight his corner, stay
loyal to the many constituents who had voted for him over a nine-year
period? No, he hightailed it off to the Livingston New Town seat as
quickly as he could pack his carpet bag.
It was not as though the newly-created Edinburgh Central was a sure
bet for the Tories. Indeed, four years after it was born, Mr Alistair
Darling won it for Labour and has held it comfortably ever since.
Livingston, though, was a damn sight safer.
I do not blame Robin for going -- kamikaze acts are for death-wish
pilots, not ambitious politicians -- any more than I berate his change
of heart on Europe or devolution, or his swift move to the right. It is
just the hypocrisy of the Labour campaign which is difficult to swallow.
We must, all of us, stop attempting to impose a moral creed upon
politicians that we have no intention of following ourselves. After all,
if you worked for an organisation that was almost certainly going to
make you redundant, would you hang on given the chance of another job?
We do not pillory people for moving from one company to another to
better themselves. Why do we expect politicians to be ultra loyal?
The most spectacular own goal in constituency shifts came in 1983,
when Iain Sproat, now the nation's sports supremo, deserted Aberdeen
South to contest Roxburgh and Berwickshire. He lost the new seat, while
Gerry Malone went on to hold the one Sproatie had just quit. They say,
upon hearing both results, that Gerry needed an operation to keep his
face straight.
You move your seat and you takes your chance.
I have represented bits of Colinton Ward on various councils for over
25 years but it has not always been the same parts or the identical set
of residents. At one time the giant Wester Hailes housing scheme was in
my ken, giving vent to an anguished plea by the tenants' association
chairman: ''Will you shut up and let the councillor speak? He may be a
Tory but at least he is our bloody Tory.'' Despite this vote of
confidence I did not seek the Wester Hailes nomination when the area
gained full council status.
Nor is carpet-bagging exactly a new trend. If you doubt that fact,
trace the career of Winston Churchill.
The statement, made in recent days in relation to MPs and with which I
agree, came from Mr Dudley Fishburn, currently the Conservative member
for Kensington, who is not taking his bag anywhere in future, except
home.
''We are creating ever more MPs,'' he thundered, ''and telling them
that they must all be full-time politicians. Modern society needs fewer
politicians, not more. It is a madness we shall come to regret.''
I regret it already, Dud. In vain I attempted to persuade the Scottish
Office, pre-local government reorganisation, that it should slash the
number of councillors by at least two-thirds. Edinburgh could be run by
about 15 to 20, Glasgow 30.
Nobody listened. Now, I bet you, on councils up and down the land we
have loads of silent cannon fodder, mainly representing the Labour
Party, voting when they are told, and about as much use to their
constituents as a goldfish in a drought.
After the next General Election we will have 659 MPs and most of the
people they represent will never have heard of half of them. What a
monstrous waste of money.
Sir Michael Hirst, who happens to be a friend of mine, attempts to
justify this on the grounds that British legislators work longer hours
than anyone else in Europe. That is only because, dear Mickey, as you
know perfectly well, the House of Commons is organised to suit male MPs
who have day jobs. Two-car funerals have been better run.
But hark! Should the red day dawn and Mr Blair and the boys take over
the corner shop, can we then expect a reduction in the burden of elected
members? Can we heckers like.
Tony and the troops promise us 100 plus more snouts in the trough at
the Scottish Parliament without a single reduction in the number of Hon
Members at Westminster. Whether this will be entirely satisfactory to
some in the socialist ranks, notably those representing North of England
seats, remains a matter for conjecture, I believe Mr Blair and Mr George
Robertson when they say there is no going back on the Scottish
parliament promise. What I cannot accept is that their plan, as it
stands, is little more than a way of creating an additional tax burden
for the people of Scotland.
Mr Dobson, then, may sing a different tune. How about: ''Chick, chick,
chick, chick chicken, lay a golden egg for me''?

THE Labour movement, if not divided over the issue of a minimum wage,
appears to be uncertain as to how to proceed. The TUC has decided that
the basic living rate should be ''half of the median male earnings'',
which in today's money equals about #4.10 an hour.
The New Labour Party refuses to put a figure on a minimum wage and
will decide once it is in power. The third leg of the Labour Party, the
Co-operative movement, has no such hesitation.
A notice at the Co-op Scotmid superstore at Tannochside, Uddingston,
Lanarkshire announces that the shop is looking for two cleaners to work
from 6am to 8am for the princely sum of #2.30 an hour. The word
exploitation springs to mind.
It is a subject in which Scotland's six Labour Co-op-sponsored MPs --
George Foulkes, John McFall, Ian Davidson, Gordon McMaster, Lewis
Moonie, and Tommy McAvoy -- might like to take an interest.
Non-stop music
YOU will have read that the Clyde resort of Millport will be converted
into Nashville, Tennessee, at the weekend for a country and western
music festival. Posters for the event urge visitors to ''catch the fast
train to Largs''. You will have read just how fast those trains to Largs
can be.
Raising a stink
IN a rare bit of Welsh cheek, a ''fine perfumier'' from Powys has
launched an aftershave called ''Olde Haggis''. Selling at #5.99 for
50mls, it is available in various Edinburgh souvenir shops. We would
love to tell you the ingredients of this manly scent but the only clue
to the manufacturers is a postcode ''Wales SY16 3PL''.
According to the Royal Mail it's a place called Tregynon but the Diary
couldn't trace them. If we had unleashed haggis aftershave on the world,
we too would want to make ourselves scarce.
* ON the subject of haggis, we got it all wrong when we said earlier
this week that the Taste of Burns Country foodfest would coincide next
year with the bicentenary of the birth of Rabbie Burns. We have had many
folk on to point out that 1996 will in fact be the 200th anniversary of
Rabbie's first serious winch.
'Men' at work
A SHOW which will grace the Theatre Royal in Glasgow this autumn has
received an eloquent testimonial from a newspaper reviewer. It is called
Tap Dogs and, according to the publicity blurb, it ''beats the f*** out
of 42nd Street''.
You may not be surprised that the above quote comes from an Australian
newspaper, the Sydney Star Observer to be precise. The show has been
described as ''testosterone tap''.
It says here: ''Six raunchy, athletic, young Australian men pound the
floor with rhythmic excitement. Sweat flies and raw energy has the
audience grinning from ear to ear . . . Tap Dogs is a show about blokes
at work. They wear ripped jeans and work boots and they dance on a
building site of scaffolding, girders, ladders and ropes.'' So, there
will be plenty of cleavage on show, then.
The case of th
irate tourist
A DIALOGUE on the bus from Glasgow Airport to Buchanan Street: An
American tourist was greatly concerned that the driver had set off
without checking the bus boot was securely closed and was complaining
that her luggage was going to end up strewn over the road. ''Listen,
hen,'' said the driver. ''I'm like Sherlock Holmes -- I've never lost a
case yet.'' We know what he means, but shouldn't that be Perry Mason?
Best-days essay
REGULAR readers of the Diary may be familiar with a character called
Carrick Cumnock. He is the legendary, not to mention fictitious, Tory MP
for Brigadoon South, created by us to poke fun at the Conservatives,
Ayrshire folk, and anybody else we can think of.
We used Carrick Cumnock as a leitmotif for our coverage of the
Scottish Tory conference in Glasgow in May and had him pass opinions on
various Conservative colleagues.
Of the Hon Adam Bruce, son of the Earl of Elgin and hopeful Tory
candidate, he said: ''I was also delighted to see my old school chum,
the Hon Adam Bruce, make a sparkling contribution to the debate on
farming and fishing. Adam and I shared a billet at Glenalmond and many a
happy evening we spent toasting our muffins at an open fire and
discussing the way ahead for the Tory party in Scotland.''
Our little joke has obviously been lost on some people. A chap has
been on the phone from Glenalmond asking if the Diary, as a former
pupil, would like to contribute a light-hearted article on our happy
days at the famous Perthshire public school.
We have passed the message on to Carrick Cumnock who is currently on a
fact-finding tour of the Caribbean.

A MAN who held up a bank in Edinburgh could be stained by red dye
which takes days to disappear, it was claimed yesterday as a #15,000
reward was offered for information leading to his conviction.
The Clydesdale Bank, whose branch in the Gorgie area of the city was
targeted on Tuesday, is confident the stolen banknotes will be heavily
stained by the indelible dye.
In Tuesday's robbery, the raider, wearing a balaclava, demanded that a
cashier put money in a carrier bag.
He then ran from the bank with about #8000 and got into a blue Volvo,
possibly a 343 model, parked in Wheatfield Road.
The raider is about 30, 6ft, of medium build, with collar-length fair
hair. He wore blue jeans, dark sweatshirt, white shirt and dark training
shoes.

IF THE picture could tell its own story, it would shout with pride.
The pride of a sporting hero who has beaten his personal demons; the
pride of two sons who have cheered him on from life's sidelines.
It is now a year since Jim Baxter, the former Rangers and Scotland
player, had two liver transplants.
The decision to carry out transplants on the former Ibrox idol, whose
illness was caused by heavy drinking, sparked controversy.
But as the picture testifies, Baxter, a football legend in the 1960s
who was capped 34 times by Scotland, has undergone a dramatic
transformation.
Last night Baxter, who is 56, said at his flat in Shawlands, Glasgow:
''I feel really fantastic although I've got a bit of arthritis in my
knee which stems from the wear and tear of playing football.''
Baxter, who was nicknamed Slim Jim in his playing days, went into
hospital last year a ''15-stone dying man''.
He owed his new life to the specialists at the Scottish Liver
Transplant Unit in Edinburgh. ''There must be a much better word than
thanks. They are fantastic people, the whole unit from the surgeons to
the nurses, down to the cleaners and tea lady. I owe them my life. I owe
them everything.''
He said he now considered himself retired. ''I'm getting fit, that's
all I'm doing. I've had a great life, don't worry about me. It just
caught up with me. I have no regrets about anything.
''There is a possibility I'll go and watch Rangers this year because
they have signed Gazza. He's a bit of a character.''
If anyone should know, it's Jim Baxter.

THIS aerial photograph of Hiroshima was taken by Jim Muncie of Carluke
less than 18 months after the bomb was dropped. He had joined the RAF in
1938 as 552283 Boy Entrant Muncie and worked mainly in aerial
reconnaissance photography, but by 1946 he was working for the public
relations department of the Air Ministry as a press photographer.
When one photographer working for the British and Commonwealth
Occupation Forces in Japan took ill, he was asked to take his place. He
arrived in December and his first assignment was to take pictures of the
great earthquake on Kochi, an island off Kobe, in which 600 people died.
In January, the occupying forces were asked by the local council of
Hiroshima if their photographer would take some aerial shots of the
temporary housing reconstruction around the city.
To Sergeant Muncie it was just another assignment. But nevertheless,
before taking off in a single engine ''Auster'' High Wing aircraft, he
decided to visit the city on foot.
''It was just devastation. Everyone was looking miserable -- and this
was in January 1947, 14 months after the bomb. People were walking about
trying to get things back to reality.
''The world didn't know then about radiation. I didn't know about
radiation, although it didn't affect me,'' he said.
His memory of the Japanese people is of a defeated people, who a year
after the end of the war were astonished at how gentle their conquerors
were.
At General MacArthur's suggestion, Emperor Hirohito went on a tour of
Japan early in 1947 to show his people that he was a human being of
flesh and blood, and not a divine god. Jim Muncie accompanied the
Emperor on his tour and has pictures of him doffing his hat to the
Scottish photographer outside Osaka Palace.
Jim Muncie's war service took him all over the world and he was one of
the few to witness the damage to Hiroshima in the immediate aftermath of
the war.
Does he think it was right to drop the bomb?
''Yes. I agree it had to be dropped. If the Allies had occupied Japan,
the Americans reckoned it would have cost them a million casualties
before we won. They knew there were four million Japanese on the
mainland still armed. If the Emperor had said, 'We carry on till the
last man,' they would have done it. But he made his broadcast for
peace,'' he said.
''All I know is that the bomb stopped the war.''
Today, Mr Muncie's aerial photographs appear in exhibitions in Japan
commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the bomb and in Japanese
newspapers.

Fifty years after the atom bomb was dropped on Japan Gavin Bell asks,
was it necessary to obliterate two cities populated almost entirely by
civilians?
ON JULY 31, 1945, President Harry Truman wrote in his diary: ''We have
discovered the most terrible bomb in the history of the world.'' He
wondered whether it could be the ultimate destroyer prophesied in the
Bible. Soon he would find out. He had just ordered that it be dropped on
Japan.
Six days later, a 20-kiloton atom bomb was detonated over Hiroshima, a
city of 280,000 people at the southern end of Honshu, the largest of the
Japanese islands. In the gigantic firestorm that ensued, birds ignited
in mid-air and about 70,000 men, women, and children were incinerated.
An additional 130,000 died within months of radiation poisoning and
burns.
Gazing down at the holocaust from the B-29 bomber Enola Gay, a member
of the crew thought the city looked like ''a pot of boiling black oil''.
Truman was elated. ''This is the greatest thing in history,'' he
announced to a group of sailors. Then he went off to a comedy review
which he clearly enjoyed, relieved that the war with Japan would soon be
over.
To make sure, another bomb was exploded three days later above the
largest Roman Catholic cathedral in the Far East, at Nagasaki. The
greatest thing in history claimed a further 70,000 victims, including
about 250 Allied prisoners of war.
At the time, the moral issues of atomizing cities were barely
considered. The American public in the summer of 1945 was weary of war
and yearned for an end to it; the US military anticipated heavy
casualties in a planned land invasion of Japan; after the London blitz
and the incessant bombing of Germany in 1943-44, people had become
inured to devastating attacks on cities.
Even the horror of radioactive fall-out was brushed aside by the
champions of the bomb. General Leslie R Groves, the man in charge of the
team that constructed what he called ''the gadget'', assured a
congressional committee that radiation poisoning did not cause undue
suffering. In fact, he insisted, it was ''a very pleasant way to die''.
So the bomb had worked. It had hastened the end of hostilities, it had
saved possibly hundreds of thousands of American lives, and its victims
were regarded as fanatics who had started and pursued a Far East war
with implacable cruelty. America celebrated the Japanese surrender on
August 15, and the Allies joined them.
Fifty years on, the relief has given way to uncertainty and regret.
Was it necessary to obliterate two cities populated almost entirely by
civilians? Did US commanders exaggerate the potential casualties of a
land invasion? Were the Japanese on the point of surrendering anyway?
Some modern historians argue that the real reason the US detonated
Truman's ''most terrible bomb'' was not to finish off Japan, but to
intimidate its next enemy -- the Soviet Union.
The controversies persist, but attitudes are changing. A recent Gallup
poll indicated that while elderly Americans still narrowly approve of
the bombings, the younger generations believe it was wrong.
The revisionist view that the attacks were little more than monumental
acts of vengeance were reflected in plans for a fiftieth anniversary
exhibition at the Air and Space Museum in Washington, until they were
hotly challenged by veterans groups and members of Congress. As a
result, the exhibition has been reduced to the front section of the
Enola Gay and a few other artefacts. This duly provided a target for
protesters who daubed the fuselage of the bomber with ashes and a red
liquid purported to be blood.
The Japanese government is also embroiled in controversy over whether
or not the country should apologise for its aggression in the Pacific
War. The debate has polarised the political establishment to such an
extent that there may be no official central government commemoration
ceremony in Hiroshima this year.
Younger Japanese appear to be less concerned about the cataclysmic
events of half a century ago. According to a veteran foreign
correspondent in Tokyo, there is little interest among young people in
the anniversary. Perhaps there should be. Perhaps they should be
reflecting this week on the enduring threat of the hellish weapon that
reduced two of their cities to rubble and ashes.
Ironically, the end of the Cold War may have increased the risks of a
nuclear attack -- not by the superpowers, but by tinpot dictators and
terrorists scrambling to acquire the ingredients of an atomic bomb for
their own fanatical ends.
After 50 years of hair-trigger peace, founded dubiously on the concept
of mutually assured destruction, the collapse of the Soviet Union has
led to dangerous leaks of nuclear technology and materials. So far this
year the CIA has recorded more than 30 cases of theft or seizure, mostly
involving low-grade Russian materials recovered by German police. In
Prague last December, police found almost six pounds of enriched uranium
in the back seat of a private car, along with a Czech nuclear scientist
and two colleagues from Belarus and Ukraine.
Part of the problem is that thousands of Russian warheads are being
moved every year from stringent military control to civilian
establishments, in accordance with agreements sharply to reduce
stockpiles of missiles and multiple warheads. US experts say none of the
nearly-90 Russian facilities, where 700 tons of weapons-grade materials
are stored, has adequate security. Needless to say, scavengers from the
Middle East and elsewhere are sniffing around the nuclear dustbins.
So far none has been sighted at Coulport on Loch Long, which is
perhaps surprising. According to Brian Quail, the Joint Secretary of
Scottish CND, the Trident base has the biggest arsenal of nuclear bombs
in Europe. Mr Quail points out that while France has drawn fierce
criticism for resuming nuclear tests in the Pacific, Britain is quietly
increasing its total of operational Trident warheads to 300 -- each of
which is said to be eight times more powerful than the bomb dropped on
Hiroshima. Fifty years on, Truman's bomb is more terrible than ever, and
it is lying on our doorstep.
And as long as it exists, there is the possibility that some lunatic
will use it. The US President's diary entry in 1945 contained a Biblical
reference: ''It may be the fire destruction prophesied in the Euphrates
valley area, after Noah and his famous Ark.'' The modern-day country in
which the valley lies is Saddam Hussein's Iraq.

HAD I lived in 1945, I would have dropped the bomb on Hiroshima and
Nagasaki. War-weary, desperate, and burning with rage at the sober
sadism of the Japanese, I would have had no qualms. I do not now blame
those who developed it, dropped it, and then tried to keep it as a
deterrent. Theirs was the conventional wisdom of the time.
With hindsight, I would not have dropped it. Hindsight is much
despised. Brushed aside as if it were an optional afterthought which can
influence nothing, hindsight is one way of learning from our mistakes.
It fulfils both criteria of logical positivism in that it is both
analytical and empirical. On both counts the bomb is wrong.
There is a kind of conventional logic which links pro-life opinions
and pacifism, and Christianity. It enjoys dividing opinion into left
wings and right wings. My kind of opinions are usually classed as
right-wing: I support euthanasia, do not object to abortion in many
instances, want the death penalty for some categories of murder, and
support the maintenance of our armed forces. Why then do I break ranks
and oppose the bomb?
First the analytical case. Until 1945, all weapons developed by humans
were logical extensions of previous types, and simply made the purpose
(ie killing people) more efficient. Swords killed more people than
daggers, cannon balls more than pistols, and machine guns were more
efficient as killing machines than rifles. Applied to bombs, this kind
of analysis would allocate them a place on a scale according to how
large an area they would destroy. On this scale the atom bombs dropped
on Japan in August 1 945 were at the top of the scale. However, as has
been pointed out, they were surpassed in quantity and the scale of their
destruction by Dresden and much of the Vietnam bombing. If you compute
the numbers killed by them, they are not unique in human history.
But hindsight has granted us information which Oppenheimer and his
team at Los Alamos did not possess, namely that nuclear weapons are not
like any other type of weapons which have existed previously, because a
small number of them can wipe out all life on earth.
The empirical argument against the bomb is very simple. It has the
benefit of hindsight and relies upon what we now know of the acts and
motives of those who were custodians of atomic weapons in the early
days.
Secret papers released after the events have revealed that there have
been prominently placed generals on both sides in the Cold War who were
prepared to loose the lightning which would have had terrible
consequences for humanity. The greatest argument against the bomb is
human frailty.
Hindsight supplies me with the answer to the question of what I would
have done in 1945. Yes, I would have developed the bomb -- the peaceful
benefits of atomic fission would justify the research. But once its
power became evident, I would have dropped it on Mount Fuji. It would
have been a symbolic attack on the sacred mountain of Japan to
demonstrate that the Japanese had transgressed something higher than
themselves. When they had signed a peace treaty under threat of further
bombs, I would have called a world conference to establish under the UN
a non-proliferation treaty such as has been negotiated in recent years
by those who had the benefit of hindsight denied to our leaders in 1945.

THERE are two big questions about Hiroshima and Nagasaki which must be
answered separately. First, should nuclear weapons have been developed
at all?
That this is somewhat absurd can be seen by applying it to any
previous innovation. To paraphrase the first sentence of the Communist
Manifesto, the history of all hitherto known societies is the history of
war and no society has ever passed up the chance to make itself more
powerful than its enemies, present or future, by improving its weapons.
Given the possibility of nuclear weapons, there was bound to be the
reality. The sensible question must be not should we have built the bomb
but what were the consequences of doing so.
On balance, and it is a fine balance, the consequences have been
benign. The bomb established the US as the major world power, which was
no bad thing. Worse than having the Cherubim and Seraphim in charge, of
course, but a lot better than Stalin. Although both superpowers have
pursued their own global interests, the American have often done this by
trying to win friends.
The countries unfortunate enough to be liberated by the USSR found
their own democratic and civil institutions replaced by puppet regimes
and their assets stripped.
The nuclear arsenals of East and West allowed the two mightiest and
most antagonistic military empires to confront each other without going
to war. John and Yoko and thousands of hippies singing Give Peace a
Chance did not prevent the great ideological clash degenerating into
warfare: the fear of mutually assured destruction did.
Finally, the expense of competing with the US's nuclear weapons
programme bankrupted the Soviet empire.
If we accept that the effects of the bomb on international relations
have not been all that bad, does it follow that it was necessary to drop
atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki? Perhaps not. Perhaps an
invitation to the Japanese Imperial Command to attend a test firing in
the Mojave desert would have brought the same speedy end to the war. But
threats are most credible when the effects have been seen and when we
believe they may be carried out.
Did the Japanese deserve to suffer 200,000 deaths and half that number
again seriously injured? To be blunt, once one accepts that there is no
easily sustainable distinction between combatants and civilians in total
war, and that all the citizens of a country must stand and fall with the
actions of that country's leadership, then it is hard to see the
inflicting of such casualties as a major injustice.
Nobody made Japan enter the war. Japan was an aggressor which stole
the land and resources of its neighbours. In pursuing their war aims,
the Sons of Nippon behaved appallingly, even by the low ethical
standards of wartime. Remember the Burma railway? German and Italian
prisoners of war in Scotland were not forced to work. As the Allied
troops liberated territory taken by the Axis powers, they did not
pressgang young women into prostitute battalions to service sexually
their infantry men.
It was a bad day for the world when scientists worked out how to make
nuclear power into a weapon. But it could have been worse. The Germans,
the Japanese, or the Russians might have got there first.

The language was prim and proper; there was to be no swearing to mark
the dropping of the bomb that cursed generations. All of the warnings
were just too carefully worded, when the truth, perhaps too awful to
contemplate, should have been clearly spelled out. Fifty years on, John
Linklater asks whether such devastation was necessary and whether it
could have been prevented
If atomic bombs are to be added to the world's arsenals . . . the time
will come when mankind will curse the name of Hiroshima
ONE hour from Hiroshima the crew of Enola Gay were told what they were
doing. Colonel Paul Tibbets switched on the intercom and said: ''We are
carrying the world's first atomic bomb.'' Briefings back at base on the
Pacific island of Tinian had emphasised that up until now their missions
had been ''small potatoes'', but the raid they were planning would
shorten the war by at least six months.
Witnessing take-off were film cameras ordered from Washington. It had
been celebrity treatment. Photographs of the 11-man crew, the front row
of five squatting, make them look like a soccer team before a big final.
Now, 30,000 feet above Japan, Tibbets advised his men that when the
bomb was dropped their reactions would be recorded for history. ''Watch
your language,'' he warned.
What would disturb history more: a few airmen's expletives, or the
annihilation of 118,661 civilians, a continuing death toll over the next
50 years in the long-term effects of radiation sickness, genetic and
chromosome injuries, the aborting or stunting of unborn children, and an
unparalleled risk through inevitable arms race to the future security of
the planet? Hiroshima changed the world. We became a self-endangered
species, but we keep it clean. We watch our language. We learn to use
political correctness and we hide in euphemism. Hiroshima taught us how
to survive from guilt.
They called the bomb ''Little Boy''. It was named in the memory of
Roosevelt, just as Colonel Tibbets had requested, with touching
sentiment, the christian names of his mother to be painted on the side
of the B-29 no.28 that carried it, and just as the bomb dropped three
days later on Nagasaki was named ''Fat Man'' after Churchill. ''Babies
satisfactorily born,'' was the message sent to President Truman at
Potsdam to confirm the success (turning the desert to glass) of the
first nuclear test bomb in New Mexico, signalling the countdown to
Hiroshima three weeks later.
This theme of healthy fecundity, little boys and new babies, was a
little irony that might have been lost on the people of Hiroshima and
Nagasaki, but might return to disturb us 50 years later. Otherwise the
choice of euphemisms was strictly prosaic. The codename of the project
to develop the bomb had been the Manhattan Engineer District, an
inspired device to present an image of dry bureaucracy and arouse
minimal curiosity. It also represented a curious geographical
inaccuracy. The network of the Manhattan Project was diverse, with its
bomb design and assembly plant nerve centre under J Robert Oppenheimer
in Los Alamos, but little of its activities ever troubled the Manhattan
skyline. Security required a creative form of misleading. British
nuclear energy research in 1941 had been conducted under the sparkling
title of the Directorate of Tube Alloys. The language of the enterprise
to perfect atomic destruction had always been prim.
Having been set this example, it is interesting to record how the crew
of the Enola Gay did react after they had unburdened themselves of their
9000lb cargo and their plane lurched upwards, free of its weight of
responsibility. As the first shockwaves met them at 30,000 feet they
thought they were under attack from flak. ''The sons of bitches are
shooting at us!'' yelled the bombardier. The co-pilot, Captain Robert
Lewis, said he could taste atomic fission. It tasted like lead. ''Look
at that son of a bitch go!'' he exclaimed. But in the log he was keeping
of the mission he recorded: ''My God, what have we done?'' It was a
question the international scientific community was asking itself.
Oppenheimer, who spent the rest of his career being hounded as a major
security risk and a potential defector to the Soviet Union, spoke two
months later. He said: ''If atomic bombs are to be added to the arsenals
of a warring world, or to the arsenals of nations preparing for war,
then the time will come when mankind will curse the names of Los Alamos
and Hiroshima.''
It has to be established at the outset that the development of an
atomic bomb became a wartime necessity. News of the discovery of nuclear
fission, by German and Austrian physicists, was reported only months
before the Nazi invasion of Poland, so the marriage of Mars and Minerva,
cataclysmic war and revolutionary science, was inextricable. It was only
a question of who would develop the bomb first. The assumption was never
challenged that whoever got there first would use it. That, at least,
was the initial scenario.
However, it was a race in which all but one of the competitors dropped
out. Soviet Russia had not the resources to devote to theoretical
advances made by its scientists. Japan had neither the manpower nor the
raw materials of uranium necessary. An incidental folly of Nazi
Germany's racist ideology was that it persecuted the very Jewish
scientists who could contribute most, and many assisted the Manhattan
Project in exile. There is also recent evidence that German scientists
back-pedalled, fearing to hand over so lethal a weapon to political
leaders whose sanity was only scarcely more dependable than their
ethics.
Britain, after taking the early lead, was forced to focus its
scientific effort on radar and electronic warfare. It transferred its
available nuclear expertise to the Manhattan Project, and that ensured
that by 1942 the United States was the only nation capable of producing
an atomic weapon. Many doubted that it would prove feasible. Even among
the community of 600,000 scientists involved there were earnest prayers
that nature would spare their conscience. That it would provide a
merciful barrier to any breakthrough.
The pressure for success became political rather than a military
imperative. The investment was simply too great to pull back. By the
time Truman succeeded Roosevelt in 1945 the estimated cost had risen to
$2 billion. In the history of mankind only the Great Pyramid, requiring
100,000 slaves working for 20 years, and the Great Wall of China,
involving one million labourers, have expended more of a nation's
resources towards a single construction. The atomic bomb had assumed a
terrible logic of its own.
The success of the Alamogordo (was the site chosen for its echo of
Armageddon, or was that a by-product?) test explosion on July 16, 1945,
created an inevitability in the minds of the Allied political
leadership. Informed of the development at Potsdam, Stalin told Truman
that he hoped the new weapon would be used on Japan, but it is evident
that he still had little comprehension of its scale or substance. Better
informed was Churchill, who noted Truman's sudden buoyancy in the
negotiations at Potsdam, and recorded in his memoirs: ''There never was
a moment's discussion as to whether the atomic bomb should be used or
not.'' He followed the claims that its immediate deployment would save
the loss of one million servicemen, and half as many again of British,
in the final invasionary assault on Japan, anticipating ''desperate
resistance of the Japanese fighting to the death with Sammurai
devotion''.
History no longer accepts that Hiroshima and Nagasaki were necessary
to the conclusion of the war with Japan. On the table was the Potsdam
Ultimatum which demanded unconditional surrender from Japan. In the
event, even after two atomic attacks and the simultaneous declaration of
war on Japan by the Soviet Union who immediately invaded Manchuria, a
single condition was achieved with the surrender. Japan kept its
Emperor. Diplomatic opinon was that the same settlement could have been
achieved without Hiroshima and Nagasaki, by October at latest. The
Japanese surrender came on August 15. Truman had been privately
indicating that Tokyo was the next target. That would have been
unlikely. He had no atom bombs left.
If Hiroshima and Nagasaki were intended as a demonstration, they
credited the Japanese with little imagination. The Potsdam Ultimatum
threatened the ''utter devastation of the Japanese homeland'', but it
declined to make explicit the atomic weapon. Neither was there a
willingness to explore the possibilities of detonating the bomb on open
territory, or on an uninhabited island, or over the sea, or on an
evacuated island. Millions of pamphlets dropped on Japan warned of the
direst reprisals if the militarists did not capitulate, but there was no
mention of atomic bombs. It was a tragic case of watching language when
the consequences needed to be spelled out to secure peace.
This all assumes that Hiroshima and Nagasaki had anything at all to do
with the conclusion of the war with Japan. If they did, it was a
dramatic case of ending one confrontation by a means that guaranteed the
beginning of another. If Stalin had responded coolly to Truman's first
intimations about the atomic bomb at Potsdam, misunderstanding the
implications, he got the message after Hiroshima.
Kruschev recalled that Stalin was ''frightened to the point of
cowardice'' after the explosion. A Soviet version of the Manhattan
Project was set up immediately. Stalin ordered all Russian technology to
give new priority to developing a nuclear arsenal. ''If we don't manage
to do all these things very quickly, the British and the Americans will
crush us.'' The impact on Soviet insecurity, at precisely the moment the
Red Armies were supposed to have achieved a stunning victory in
adversity over Nazi Germany, would reverberate for another 45 years. The
Cold War had begun. The Soviets had their name for it: Atomic Diplomacy.
Today we ask, was it necessary? Not in terms of the war with Japan,
which was effectively over. Not in terms of a propaganda broadside at
Stalin, because world security could not afford a blatant challenge to
enter an arms race. Yet we have survived it for 50 years when senior
allied politicians put the betting at 10-1 on a Third World War.
Only in one respect did Hiroshima and Nagasaki serve any purpose.
Having developed the atomic bomb, someone would have to exploit it.
That, regrettably, is the way that human beings function, and the longer
the atomic bomb remained an abstraction the more dangerous it would
become, the more globally imperilling its ultimate and inevitable
release. Hiroshima and Nagasaki suffered attack from a prototype
infinitely less capable than subsequent generations of nuclear weaponry,
and that was sufficient to send the world into a state of salutary
dread. It was a terrible sacrifice. Fifty years is not enough to honour
our debt, but we can acknowledge it in humility and regret.

William Russell finds fun for all the family this week with tales of
making mountains and saving Orca whales, along with witty cartoon capers
THIS is the week of the family. The three new films all have U
certificates. Will wonders never cease? Firmly in the Ealing tradition,
Chris Monger's The Englishman Who Went Up A Hill But Came Down A
Mountain is a beguiling fantasy about quaint rural Britons -- in this
case they are Welsh -- who come up against the city English. A kind of
Whisky Galore of the valleys, in which bumbling English officialdom is
frustrated in its attempt to impose law and order by the wiles of the
duplicitous locals, it aspires to the heights scaled by Ealing and just
about achieves them.
The best thing in a film in which riches abound, is the performance of
the veteran Welsh actor, Kenneth Griffith, as the Reverend Jones -- the
hellfire spouting parson of the village of Ffynnon Garw. Jowls
pendulous, eyes full of rheum, uttering impassioned appeals to the Lord
to save the village from disaster, he gives an inspired comic
performance which never crosses the thin line separating the
outrageously funny from the crudely grotesque.
In other words, the Reverend Jones is a real person, not just a stock
character from the comedy writer's guide.
Written and directed by Monger, the story is based on a tale his
grandfather handed down about how two English cartographers from the
Ordnance Survey arrived in the border village of Ffynnon Garw in the
summer of 1917 to measure the local mountain which was the villagers'
pride and joy because it is the first mountain in Wales.
The problem is that officialdom has decreed a mountain must be a
thousand feet high and the wretched mound is only 984 feet. What is to
be done? Make it bigger, of course.
The cartographers, perfect Naughton Wayne and Basil Radford roles, are
played by the film's ostensible star, Hugh Grant, and Ian McNeice.
Grant, who plays Reginald Anson, a young man invalided out of the Army,
uses all his familiar tricks to considerable effect, although his
bashful mannerisms are getting a little over-familiar and the role, one
of his best, does not stretch his talents.
As George Garrad, the portly, stuffy older man with a taste for gin,
McNeice is very good indeed.
The villagers -- led by the Reverend Jones, his foe, the libidinous
local publican, Morgan the Goat (Colm Meaney, the Irish actor, doing
what sounds like a very good Welsh turn), and the visiting Betty from
Cardiff (Tara Fitzgerald), who is no better than she should be, but has
a heart of gold -- proceed to frustrate the visitors' efforts to leave
once the mountain has been measured.
There is nothing particularly novel in how they do this, but the
jokes, mostly old, are planted with skill by Monger. Tudor and Hugh
Vaughn contribute a lovely double-act as local-yokel brothers, Thomas
Twp and Thomas Twp Too who are not so twp (which is daft) as not to know
they are twp.
Ian Hart makes much of his tiny role as Johnny Shellshocked, a veteran
of the trenches, and Miss Fitzgerald, who co-starred with Grant in
Sirens, looks lovely, although her romance this time round with him is
wishful thinking of the highest order.
Monger tries to set the story in some kind of social context -- the
war and disasters down the mines are referred to -- but never manages to
achieve his aim of integrating the gentle comedy of the enlarging of
Ffynnon Garw into a wider picture of the times. Llanrhaeadr-ym-Mochnant,
where it was filmed, has been beautifully photographed by Vernon Layton,
and the film is a real mid-summer treat.
Directed by Dwight Little, Free Willy 2, is the sequel to the hugely
successful Free Willy of a couple of years back in which a problem child
called Jesse (Jason James Richter) befriended a lonely Orca whale kept
in an aquarium and helped the creature escape to the wild. That film
used a real whale and its makers came under criticism when it emerged
that the whale, far from roaming the seas, was still trapped in an
unsuitable aquarium environment. But arrangements to move it and train
it for life in the wild are at last being made.
There are no such problems with this film, because real whales are
seen only in some inspired pre-opening credits of wildlife footage of
Orcas gambolling at sea, and the Orca whales seen sporting with Jesse
and his chums are animatronic robots. If you thought the monsters in
Jurassic Park amazing, they have nothing on Willy, his sister Luna, and
his younger brother, Littlespot. It is impossible to tell where the
joins are.
The film is impeccably green in its sentiments, and although it takes
some time to get going, when the adventures start they are as thrilling
as any small boy or girl could wish.
Jesse, now a teenager, is living with his foster parents, the
ever-so-nice Greenwoods (Michael Madsen and Jayne Atkinson) when a
bombshell is dropped -- his long-lost mother has died leaving behind an
eight-year-old half-brother, Elvis (Francis Capra) who comes to stay
with the Greenwoods for a spot of sibling bonding.
Naturally things do not go smoothly because Elvis is a bumptious
little prat, although a softie underneath, and Jesse feels jealous
because Elvis has known their mother more recently and for longer than
he did. Jesse has other problems -- girls -- and Master Richter duly
enjoys his first screen kiss.
Things take wing after the Greenwoods take the boys on a camping trip
to the San Juan islands, where Jesse's Indian chum from the aquarium,
Randolph (August Schellenberg), is a sea ranger. And guess who is
swimming around in the bay just dying to renew acquaintance -- Willy.
An oil tanker runs aground, polluting the waters, and the whales have
to be rescued by the ever-intrepid Jesse who, in turn, has to be rescued
by Willy.
The scenery is gorgeous, the whales incredible, the playing pleasing,
and you will have a whale of time.
The first to be filmed in English, but the seventh in the series,
Asterix Conquers America is an inventive, witty, if rather crudely
drawn, feature-length cartoon about the adventures of the pugnacious
little Gaul and his greedy chum Obelix. Caesar, fed up with the fact
that the Gauls become invincible through drinking a potion brewed by the
Druid, Getafix, has him kidnapped and taken to the ends of the Earth.
It being flat, Getafix is catapulted over the edge. But the Earth is,
of course, round, so Getafix ends up in America living with the Indians.
Asterix and Pobelix have to come to his rescue.

KIRSTY SCOTT meets a bomb survivor who cannot forget the events of
1945 and is dedicated to stop a repeat
THE BLINDING light came first, then the wind and then, after a few
moments of unconsciousness, the torment. When Sakue Shimohira came to in
the wreckage of the air-raid shelter her hair was gone and blood was
seeping from her nose and mouth.
She found her younger sister and they stumbled outside into what was
left of Nagasaki minutes after the second atomic bomb had been dropped
on Japan. The shelter, the closest to their home, had been 800 yards
from the centre of the blast.
''When I went outside I saw many people wandering around who were so
disfigured that it was impossible to tell if they were male or female.
Their eyeballs were coming out of their faces, their insides were
hanging out of their bodies, and they had lost their hair . . . my
sister held her eyes because she did not want them to fall out.
''The scenes are still printed on my mind -- of parents and children
calling for each other as loudly as they could. Those who met up again
clung together. I suppose that several thousands or tens of thousands of
parents and children were not able to meet each other again -- however
loudly they called and however hard they stretched their arms towards
each other.''
Sakue was speaking recently in Edinburgh. She was 10 when the bomb
dropped; she's 60 now, and for the past 16 years she has travelled
across the world as a representative of the Hibakusha -- the nuclear
survivors -- to say it must never happen again. This year, she's in the
UK to speak at public meetings across England and Scotland.
Her travelling companions say she moved the audience so much in
Norwich that they asked for a minute's silence after her speech to
remember the Hibakusha and to compose themselves.
She's a tiny woman, no more than 4'10'' with neat hair, a ramrod
straight back and smart, comfortable clothes. Her face, under heavy
make-up, looks waxy and greyish but she wields her smile with all the
charm and softness of a favourite older relative -- a grandmother with a
nightmarish story to tell.
With no landmarks left, it took her a while to find her house. As she
and picked her way across the charred remains towards what had been
their home, she heard the drone of another aircraft.
''I thought it was another plane to drop another bomb and I lay down
and covered myself with a dead charred body for protection. It passed
over and nothing further happened.''
When she finally reached what had been her house, she found her mother
outside. ''My mother had been sitting down. She was so charred that I
could not identify her, except for her gold tooth. Her body looked so
fragile that it would have crumbled down into pieces if I had hugged
her, crying ''Mum''.
Sakue must have told her story a thousand times, but the memories
still hurt. She says she can see it all as if it was yesterday and
occasionally her hands flutter to her face in small, protective
gestures.
In the following months and years, what was left of the family
struggled to survive. Three days after the blast her brother also died,
vomiting something yellow and pleading with the family not to let him
slip away.
The sister, who had survived in the shelter with her, lasted another
10 years before disease and poverty drove her to commit suicide.
''She had so many operations, but her womb, her insides were rotten
and the disease was eating away at her. She killed herself because she
was damaged mentally too.''
Sakue, herself, underwent a series of operations in 1967 to remove her
uterus, ovaries and appendix. By that time she had given birth to twins
who, at the age of 38, still suffer from thyroid problems, as does her
11-year-old granddaughter. In 1986, Sakue's gallbladder was also
removed.
Before the bombing, she had been friendly with one of her young
neighbours and as the years progressed shared grief and the sense of
self-preservation brought them together and they eventually married. He
is still alive, but suffers terribly from a variety of ailments and she
talks about him sadly, dropping her head and knotting her fingers.
''His mother had been killed as well, and we have never really had any
happy times because he has always been in and out of hospital with
disease. He is still in and out.''
The tears come only once, when she's asked about the anger.
''That's exactly it, anger,'' she says. ''Just afterwards, when I was
still 10-years-old I used to think there should be more bombs dropped
everywhere so everyone can understand how we suffered, and the diseases.
But when I grew up I stopped thinking that and I just wished that never
again, there would be no more nuclear weapons and no-one will suffer
like I have suffered. Now, I don't want anyone else to face that. While
I am alive I will try to extinguish all the nuclear weapons so that the
next generation will not have to look at the same horror.''
In 1979 she started taking a more active role in the Hibakusha, taking
part in UN special sessions on disarmament, speaking in Europe and the
USA, and taking part in a medical fact-finding mission.
She sees people moved by her story but also sees the proliferation of
nuclear weapons and worries that the lessons which seem so simple to the
Hibakusha have not been learned by the wider world.
''I am very sad, now. I want people to learn the lesson that to face
that disaster is awful,'' she pauses and keeps her head down. ''But I

William Lowther speaks to the Enola Gay pilot who gave the order to
drop the first atomic bomb
STOCKY and tough, cool and crusty, General Paul Tibbets has no
regrets. He is 80 now, the pilot who flew the Enola Gay over Hiroshima
on August 6, 1945, and gave the order to drop the world's first atomic
bomb.
Apart from being hard of hearing, he is in near-perfect health with a
shock of gray hair and twinkling blue eyes. There are no worry lines on
this ruddy face, and it's easy to believe him when he says that he has
never lost a night's sleep or agonised over his role.
''Right after we dropped the bomb, I felt much the same as I do now
except that I hadn't drunk as much coffee that morning,'' he said last
week from the home of an old friend in Maryland where he was staying.
He added: ''I was satisfied that I had accomplished my mission. It was
a success. I had no emotion about it then, and I have none to this day
except to tell you that war is hell. I know. I have had the experience.
If you are trying to get an emotional expression out of me, you won't do
it. I'm a cold fish.''
General Tibbets, who lives in Columbus, Ohio, went on: ''That bomb had
to be dropped. The longer I live, the more I am convinced of that. There
was no alternative. I don't care what the revisionists say, the Japanese
would never have surrendered. They were prepared to fight to the last
woman and child.''
General Tibbets was born on a farm in rural Iowa but his family moved
to Florida when he was 12. His father ran a general store and General
Tibbets got his first air experience when a company that produced
chocolate bars sent a plane into the area to promote a new product.
The idea was for the pilot to fly over local events and drop dozens of
the chocolate bars over the side, each one attached to a little paper
parachute that allowed it to float down to the crowds below.
The pilot needed an assistant to help throw the chocolate out and
General Tibbets eagerly volunteered. After an hour in the air, ''if
anybody was ever bit by the flying bug, it was me,'' remembers General
Tibbets. Later, he dropped out of medical school to join the US Air
Force.
Based in Britain after the US entered the Second World War, he led the
first B-17 daylight bomber attack on German-occupied France on August
17, 1942, and flew General Eisenhower to Gibraltar as the invasion of
North Africa was launched.
In March 1943 General Tibbets, at that time a colonel, was sent back
to the US to help in the development of the B29-bomber. As major
advances were made on the plane, he was called for a special briefing in
September, 1944.
But first, the chief of security for the Manhattan Project (something
General Tibbets had never heard of) pulled him aside. A background check
showed that as a young man, Tibbets had been arrested by the police but
there were no details of the charge.
''Well, I had to tell them,'' recalls General Tibbets. ''One summer
night when I was in college I was over on North Miami Beach. It was two
o'clock in the morning and I was in the back seat of my automobile with
a young lady and in a somewhat compromising position.
''I had the windows open because it was hot in there. When a
flashlight comes on and shines on us and a voice says: 'Hey, they build
hotels for you to do that.' So we were taken to the police station and I
was in court the next day.
''And that little event showed up and nearly put a stop on my security
clearance. But when I told them the details, they said it was OK.''
General Tibbets was told to build the team that would drop the first
atom bomb. He recalls: ''By April, 1945, I had a good outfit. They were
flying great. But Los Alamos was still wanting to experiment.
''I had to talk to Dr Oppenheimer. Everyone called him Oppie. I asked,
'Oppie, what are you waiting for?' He said that he wanted to be sure
that our chances of failure were minimal.
''I asked him what he thought the chances of failure were right at
that time. He said one in ten thousand. I said: 'Those odds are good
enough for me.' I had an outfit that was ready to go to war. If I kept
on training them, I'd destroy them. They wouldn't be worth a damn.''
That argument was enough to persuade senior military men in
Washington, and the secret bomb group was moved to Tinian Island in the
South Pacific. Says General Tibbets: ''Only President Truman could give
the go ahead. We got the message from the White House on the fifth of
August and at two o'clock the next morning we were all on the runway
beside the Enola Gay ready to take off.''
Some of the crew had objected to the name that General Tibbets had
given the plane, but he refused to change it. Enola Gay was his mother's
name. She was given it by her father who was reading a ''dime novel'' on
the night she was born. The heroine of the novel was called Enola Gay
and he liked it.
''I picked my mother's name because when I dropped out of medical
school to become a flier my father said he was sure that I would kill
myself. But my mother was very supportive and said that she was sure
that I'd do all right.''
Of the flight itself, General Tibbets says: ''My orders were to bomb
visually. They wanted to be sure of the target. It was a beautiful night
to fly.
''We had to make an escape manoeuvre that was a rather dramatic turn
for a big airplane at that altitude in those days. I turned to the right
at 160 degrees. According to Oppie, that would give me the greatest
distance from the point of explosion and the shock wave.
''When we released, when the 10,000-pound bomb left us, the nose of
the plane jumped up with the sudden loss of weight. In the meantime, I
was rolling the aileron into the start of my turn because I had to make
it within 50 seconds.
''Just as I rolled out of the turn, the sky lit up. The bomb had
exploded. I turned to the south of the city so that we could see what
had been done by the explosion.
''We couldn't really tell what had been done except that we were
pretty sure the city had been, well I won't say obliterated because from
under this big black cloud of boiling debris you could see little
pockets of surviving civilisation on the circumference.''
General Tibbets was supposed to send a message back to base in code to
report on the explosion. ''But I just dispensed with the code and told
them right out that results were greater than expected. Hell, why did we
need a code? The Japanese knew what had happened.''
Of the 12-man crew aboard the Enola Gay only four still survive, all
of the others died of natural causes. Says General Tibbets: ''I kept in
touch with them all, and not one of them ever regretted it.''

Ros Davidson finds that half a century on, the world is still guaging
the health impacts of radiation unleashed on Japan
FIFTY years after America first dropped atomic bombs, in many ways it
is still the day after. Although the immediate impact on civilians in
Hiroshima and Nagasaki is well-known, other aspects of the nuclear era
remain far from settled.
Controversy still rages about the bombing President Harry Truman
ordered. So much, in fact, that America's highest-profile 50th
anniversary exhibit, at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, has
been dramatically scaled back to avoid emphasis on Japanese casualties.
After pressure from angry US war veterans, predictions of American
casualties in an invasion were boosted too -- from a sceptical 40,000 in
the first 30 days to one million.
Also far from clear are the health impacts of the large-scale
radiation first unleashed on Japan, and subsequently throughout the Cold
War. During the past few weeks, it has been widely reported that there
is consensus on the long-term effects on survivors and their children --
and that it is far less ghastly than the victims, public, and scientists
expected.
But critics say there is a fundamental ''conflict of interest'' --
those studying the Hibakusha, as Japanese survivors are called, and Cold
War survivors in America are usually government-affiliated scientists.
The results are biased, which compounds the scientific difficulty of
isolating the effects of radiation, they say.
The most extensive study, by the Japanese-US Radiation Effects
Research Foundation, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1985, has also
led to dangerous generalisations, says the group Physicians for Social
Responsibility. Even if the impacts of Hiroshima and Nagasaki are
accurate, the exposure was acute. The impact of chronic radiation, on
Cold War nuclear plant workers or unwitting ''down-winders'' near test
sites or weapons labs, differs profoundly.
In the Smithsonian Institute, at the centre of the anniversary
exhibition is the Enola Gay, the B-29 plane that dropped the first bomb.
Yet artefacts and photographs of the destruction were removed because
they were ''anti-American'' and ''pacifist''. And consequently, the
director of the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum, Dr Martin Harwitt,
resigned.
The true impact of radiation is also hotly disputed. Although the main
study suggests that cancer rates among Hibakusha are only slightly above
normal, the results are distrusted. Indeed even the immediate horror of
the bombs was disguised, initially at least. The US Government
misleadingly insisted the targets were military until the New Yorker
magazine detailed the extent of the charred bodies and hideously
disfigured survivors.
Japanese survivors have added cancer rates of 8-12%, while the
pregnancies underway in August 1945 resulted in four times more birth
defects than usual, the two-government foundation reported last year.
But numerous other findings from the data have been missed, says
Darryl Kimball of Physicians for Social Responsibility. ''It is
politically biased and scientifically flawed and the public has been
robbed,'' he says.
Fred Allingham of the National Association of Radiation Survivors,
which represents 11,000 people, adds that although some cancers may not
be much more frequent, there is evidence that several organs are indeed
endangered -- the thyroid, stomach, kidneys, urinary tract, bladder,
liver and larynx. He says some scientists now also believe the latency
period from exposure is perhaps as long as 50 years, rather than 15 to
20 years as initially believed.
In America, the estimated two million atomic veterans, former workers
in atomic plants, uranium miners, and civilian ''down-winders'' have
vastly higher rates of diseases from chronic exposure, says Allingham.
As many as one-fifth of his group's 11,000 members have children with
genetic defects, or higher rates of miscarriages or still-births. More
chillingly, their grandchildren suffer from a higher rates of ailments
such as spina bifida, physical deformities such as missing limbs, toes
or fingers, or attention-deficit disorder.

Washington, Wednesday
POLICE now believe they have the clue that will lead them to the
Unabomber -- his own writings.
He is the mad bomber anarchist who has killed three people and wounded
23 in a series of mail bombs since 1978 and who posted off a 35,000-word
manifesto to newspapers last month.
The New York Times and the Washington Post, which were sent copies,
published extracts this morning. They also reveal that the FBI has sent
copies of the full document to academics at a number of universities in
Chicago, Utah, and northern California.
Internal evidence in the manifesto suggests that the Unabomber studied
the history of science at some of those institutions, or at least hung
around them. He was in Chicago in the late 1970s,when the first two
bombs were sent, perhaps at the University of Illinois in Chicago or at
Northwestern.
He then moved to Salt Lake City, finally ending in the Sacramento
region of California. He may have had some contact with the University
of California at Berkeley.
The police calculate that someone so obsessed with the evils of modern
technology, who despises liberals because they want to protect the
weaker brethren from the forces of nature, and conservatives because
they have embraced modernity, must have left some traces behind him.
About 60 professors have been sent copies. The bureau hopes that one
of them will remember a disputatious and disgruntled pupil or junior
colleague, aged now about 40. The memo includes numerous footnotes
listing books he used and the authors of these volumes are being asked
if the text looks familiar. No doubt libraries in the three areas are
being checked, to see if a pattern of borrowings can be discovered.
The two newspapers, acting in concert, published about 3000 words of
the manifesto today. Unabomber had informed them that if they published
the full text he would give up lethal attacks. He said that he would
continue to attack modern industry, however, but without killing people.
The papers have yet to decide whether to comply. He set a three-month
deadline, and they presumably hope that he will be caught before it
expires.
Today's extracts repeat the themes in Unabomber's earlier letters to
other papers. ''The industrial revolution and its consequences have been
a disaster for the human race,'' he begins.
''They have destabilised society, have made life unfulfilling, have
subjected human beings to indignities, have led to widespread
psychological suffering, and have inflicted severe damage to the natural
world.''
He concludes with a call to revolution, meaning the destruction of
modern society and a return to the purities of peasant existence.

Larnaca, Wednesday
THE parents of Danish tour guide Louise Jensen came face to face with
their daughter's alleged British killers in a Cyprus court today.
Poul Jensen, his wife Annette, and their son Soren sat composed and
silent at the back of a courtroom in Larnaca as prosecution witnesses
gave evidence against the three British soldiers charged with killing
her.
It was the first time the family had seen the men charged with killing
the 23-year-old tour guide after a drinking bout in the resort of Ayia
Napa on September 13, 1994.
Her badly-beaten body was found in a shallow grave two days after her
disappearance.
The Jensens simply stared at defendants Alan Ford, 26, Jeff Pernell,
23, and Justin Fowler, 27, as they were taken handcuffed into the court.
As they left to be taken back to their prison cells in the capital
Nicosia, Annette Jensen stood within 3ft of the defendants, glowering at
them.
Fowler's father Jack sat on another bench on the opposite side of the
court, which continued forensic evidence today.
The soldiers have denied charges of manslaughter, abduction, and
conspiracy to rape. The hearing continues.--Reuter.

Ann Donald highlights the problems faced by head-injury victims and
their families in the daily battle to rebuild their lives
HE may look all right and talk all right -- but he's not. Sean
Stewart, 25, who sustained serious head injuries when he was assaulted
last year, says: ''I've still got pretty major problems in day-to-day
life. My family and girlfriend try to understand but they can't see the
damage because it's all inside.''
He is only one of about 5700 people in Scotland who sustain
moderate-to-severe head injuries annually. Most common in men between
the ages of 18 and 30 and usually due to car accidents or assaults,
there is a high incidence of alcohol being directly or indirectly
involved.
Though each head-injured person is obviously different depending on
the area and extent of the brain damaged, there are common long-term
problems. On a physical level most people learn to carry out the tasks
of a daily routine by the first 18 months.
However it is, as Stewart highlights, the hidden damage that causes
the residual problems. Memory loss, lack of concentration, dramatic mood
swings, and depression are often cited, as are a lack of social
communication skills which can manifest as behaviour where the
head-injured person might act in an odd, childish or outspoken manner.
For Stewart it is the Jekyll and Hyde syndrome of rapid changes in
mood and personality that he finds particularly troublesome. ''I used to
be very cool and relaxed about life,'' he explains in barely audible
tones. ''Now though, if I have an argument with my girlfriend say, I'm
straight on to the defensive and I actually find it quite frightening --
the sudden build-up of anger inside me.''
His confidence too has been shattered by the circumstances of his head
injury. ''I find it quite easy to take panic attacks and forget words
when I'm under pressure and it takes a lot of confidence not to try and
hide myself away when I'm sitting on the Underground. But that's
improving now.''
In a bid to stave off depression Stewart has resumed his computer
programming which he was studying previously as part of an HND course.
He has also been learning blues guitar ''to keep me sane''.
There is still a long way to go, however, as he admits: ''When I get
up each morning it's a battle to be positive and keep myself on the
straight and narrow. I've got to watch that I don't close the curtains
and lock myself in the house because that's what I really want to do.''
As part of this daily battle and in a determined effort to aim towards
''normality'', Stewart attends a psychologist and social communications
skills group held at the Head Injury Trust for Scotland, based in
Glasgow. Established in 1988, HITS aims to increase public awareness
about head injuries, raise funds to promote rehabilitation facilities
and provide a support group for carers and families.
It is this latter point that concerns Aileen Kennon, a lecturer in
occupational therapy at Queen Margaret College, Edinburgh. Having been
involved with Headway, the national organisation for head injured and
their families, and having worked with brain-injured people at hospitals
in Edinburgh, Kennon has closely observed the trauma relatives face in
trying to cope with a head-injured partner or family member.
In a bid to fill what she views as an ''information gap'' Kennon has
written an accessible and informative booklet aimed at carers, which is
awaiting publication. The booklet describes the problems carers are
likely to encounter, without resorting to medical jargon, and offers
advice on stress and a list of essential support group addresses.
As Kennon stresses, the carers task is incredibly daunting given that
a head-injured person has a normal life expectancy. ''As soon as a
head-injured person is physically able then they are discharged from
hospital and everything falls on to the carer.''
Highlighting the awkward no man's land between physical and mental
disability that the majority of head-injured people fall into, she goes
on to say: ''The pressure on the carers is immense because there are no
facilities geared specifically towards the rehabilitation of
head-injured people in Scotland.''
For many carers the trauma is deepened by personality changes that
occur. As Kennon states: ''What is often reiterated by relatives is that
their partner is part of the 'walking, talking wounded' because
psychologically and emotionally they are quite impaired. Again and again
we hear the statement 'They're not the same person I married. I've got
the shell but not the body of the person I remember'.''
This sentiment is echoed by Jackie and Kenny Archibald from Paisley
whose son Billy, 21, sustained serious head injuries when he fell from a
third-floor balcony while on holiday in Spain last year. ''Billy will
never be the person he was,'' says Jackie, ''but we've accepted that.''
Cataloguing the problems they have faced, Jackie cites severe memory
loss, short concentration span, and problematic behaviour. Though she
adds with a smile, ''Billy's sense of humour, which was always great, is
still there, which we're very happy about. But things like musical and
food tastes have totally changed.''
The accident has, she says, had massive reverberations for the entire
family. They had to move house. She recently returned to work while her
husband Kenny gave up his job to care for Billy on a full-time basis,
and their daughter Angie, 18, and Lisa, six, were initially quite
affected by Billy's behavioural problems of shouting and temper control.
Almost one year later, this obviously very close family are vaguely
approaching adjustment after constructing a daily routine for Billy that
is rigidly adhered to as part of his rehabilitation. As Kenny explains:
''Since Billy came home on December 23 from the brain injury unit at the
Astley Ainslie we've been doing exactly the same things every day and
we'll continue to do that until things come to a standstill and we have
to think of other ways to stimulate him.''
As part of this tailor-made rehabilitation there is a 24-hour daily
planner on Billy's bedroom wall that he fills in, together with a daily
diary to aid memory, computer games, word-puzzle books -- ''a godsend''
say the Archibalds -- and the re-teaching of simple tasks like making
tea and deciding which clothes to wear.
Outside support involves a weekly visit to an occupational therapist
and an Independent Living class at the Disability Resource Centre which,
say the Archibalds, is not ideal given that it is for physically
impaired people. There is also a weekly visilt from a Headway worker who
takes Billy out of the home environment and plans for a social services
funded carer who will look after Billy a few days a week to relieve the
family.
Inevitably the stress involved in their lives revolving around Billy,
has taken its toll on the Archibalds relationship as they both verify.
''We are finding it quite hard. It does affect your marriage because you
have no time on your own. But now we're starting to talk things over
rather than just bark at each other,'' smiles Jackie.
Though highly critical of the Astley Ainslie's laissez-faire attitude,
as they view it, regarding information and guidance of what to expect
with Billy, they have nothing but unfettered praise for HITS and Headway
support network.
As Kenny notes: ''I really don't think we would have survived without
them. The support group for carers at Headway really helps because you
can talk to each other about your fears and hopes.''
Given the fact that head injury is now the biggest cause of disability
in men under the age of 60 in Britain, it is inevitable that
organisations like HITS and Headway will become even more of a lifeline
for those like the Archibalds, affected by the repercussions of a
head-injury accident.

Salt cellar: A French wine grower has sunk 10,000 bottles in the Bay
of Biscay, hoping his wines will mature better in the company of fish,
crabs, seaweed, and sludge. Producer Jean-Louis Saget says the rocking
of the tides and currents, as well as mysterious influences of the sea
water, would give the wine a fuller flavour and a pleasant mineral tang
when they are salvaged in 1999. German buyers have already reserved 6000
of the bottles which have an extra wax seal to keep out salt water.

Washington, Wednesday
THE White House today played down the effect of China's decision to
oust two US military officers accused of spying, indicating that
negative repercussions were unlikely.
Beijing ordered Colonel Joseph Wei Chan and Captain Dwayne Howard
Florenzie, both US Air Force liaison officers in Hong Kong, to leave
China, where they had been travelling on diplomatic passports.
The two Americans were accused of sneaking into a restricted military
area on China's south-east coast to take photographs.
Chinese security officials said the pair would be expelled within
24hrs after Beijing lodged a protest with the US embassy.
Such incidents traditionally touch off a diplomatic firestorm, but
Washington's response was unusually muted.
When a reporter suggested the action by China would further strain
relations with Bejing, White House spokesman Mike McCurry said: ''You're
making assumptions on what type of repercussions or impact there will be
on this.''
He added: ''I'm not aware of any information that would lead you to
assume that there are going to be any negative repercussions.''
An official stressed that in the technical world of diplomacy, the two
men were being ordered to leave China but not ''expelled'' because they
were only in the country on visas.
TAIPEI: Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui said he would welcome a 100-year
peace treaty with China, declaring that this would help reunification of
the two countries which have been rivals since the Chinese civil war
ended in 1949.
The plea comes at a time of strained relations over a recent private
visit to the US by Lee, and after China carried out missile tests near
the island.--Reuter.

PRETORIA: South African police are holding a man suspected of
strangling 11 women and a two-year-old boy in a seven-month killing
spree.
Former court clerk Jeffrey Baloyi, 27, was arrested in Atteridgeville
township outside Pretoria on Monday after neighbours heard the screams
of a naked woman a man was attempting to throttle.
The 11 victims, found around Atteridgeville since January, had all
been raped and strangled.
The Pretoria murders were the latest involving suspected serial
killers in South Africa. In June, Norman Afzal Simons, thought to be the
so-called Station Strangler who killed 22 people over eight years, was
jailed for 25 years for murdering a boy.
In December police shot dead the prime suspect in the murders of 11
women in Johannesburg's Cleveland district.--Reuter.

<HEADLINE>Scotland's largest pig breeding firm cleared of cruelty</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>977076338</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
SCOTLAND'S largest pig breeding company was yesterday cleared of
causing unnecessary suffering to animals.
Arthur Simmers Ltd was found not guilty at Dundee Sheriff Court of
causing unnecessary suffering to animals at its Muir of Pert piggery,
Tealing, near Dundee, on February 24 last year by failing to provide
adequate veterinary treatment.
The court had heard that six pigs were put down by a Ministry of
Agriculture vet after a raid by animal cruelty officers from the SSPCA.
However, Sheriff Alexander Eccles said that the action taken by the
ministry vet was ''at the least arguably wrong''.
The sheriff explained he could not accept the Crown contention that
the firm ''deliberately caused, or permitted, unnecessary suffering to
the animals concerned, which is the crux of the case''. He added that,
on the evidence of experts, the firm had a ''high reputation'' in the
pig world.
Arthur Simmers Ltd, of Inverurie, Aberdeenshire, was also found not
guilty of causing and permitting unnecessary suffering to animals at
Muir of Pert on March 3 and August 4 last year.
Sheriff Eccles also cleared the firm of leaving pig carcasses unburied
in a place where dogs could get access on February 24 last year.
SSPCA officers had told the court that some pigs were found in
''filthy'' pens and criticised stockmanship in parts of the piggery as
''non-existent''.
But defence witnesses for the firm said that it had played a ''huge
part'' in the advancement of pig welfare in Scotland and that there was
no cruelty or lack of veterinary treatment on the piggery.
Outside the court, Mr Arthur Simmers, who owns a quarter of all sows
in Scotland, said: ''We are delighted that, after 10 days of intensive
examination of many aspects of our pig farming unit at Tealing, we have
been acquitted on every charge brought against us.
''Not only that, the evidence showed that A Simmers Ltd is in the
forefront of all matters of animal welfare. And we are particularly
pleased that the sheriff felt able, on the evidence, to say that the
company has a high reputation in the pig world and takes a prominent
lead on pig matters.''
Mr Simmers also thanked his staff for helping him through ''what has
been an anxious and distressing period for myself and for my family''.
An SSPCA spokeswoman, Ms Pauline Mullin, said: ''We are shocked. Our
inspectors thought it was a serious case.''

Leaders beg Clinton to veto ending embargo
Brussels, Wednesday
BRITAIN joined forces with the EU, Nato, and Russia today to condemn
the United States Congress for voting to end the arms embargo on Bosnia.
British officials said of last night's votes in the House of
Representatives and the Senate: ''They encourage the parties on the
ground to think of military rather than political solutions.''
Officials warned that the lifting of the arms embargo would force
Britain and other troop contributors to withdraw forces from Bosnia.
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said the American votes sent the
wrong signal.
''As much as lifting the embargo may be justified on moral and ethical
grounds, this can and may be considered only when all other means have
failed,'' he said.
He stressed that the Big Powers peace plan, which would divide the
republic roughly in half between a Muslim-Croat confederation and rebel
Serbs, remained the best chance of ending the fighting.
The House of Representatives approved the lifting of the embargo last
night by 298-128. Last week the Senate gave its backing by 69 votes to
29.
However, British diplomats believe President Bill Clinton will be able
to quash the vote.
Nato Secretary-General Willy Claes also criticised the decision by
Congress.
''I bitterly regret it. I think President Clinton is going to use his
veto,'' he told Belgian television.
Claes said that if the arms embargo were lifted, the United Nations
would lose its credibility and he feared the conflict would intensify in
former Yugoslavia.
''If all at once, the capitals in Europe decide to remove the blue
helmets, then how can we assure humanitarian aid? And there will be an
enlargement of the conflict in the Balkans.''
His fears were echoed by Russia, whose special envoy to former
Yugoslavia, Alexander Zotov, added his hopes that Clinton would succeed
in vetoing the move.
In Washington, meanwhile, EU mediator Carl Bildt, who is having two
days of talks with US officials, warned against lifting the arms embargo
on Bosnia.
''It would have very serious implications, not only for the situation
in Bosnia where the war would escalate quite rapidly, but also for the
entire credibility of US foreign policy in other areas,'' he said in a
television interview.
''There are sanctions and embargoes against other countries and it
would be virtually impossible to enforce any sanctions against any
country in the foreseeable future,'' added the former Swedish Prime
Minister.
Claes, meanwhile, reiterated Nato's commitment to do everything to
defend the so-called safe zones in Bosnia.
The eastern enclaves of Zepa and Srebrenica have already fallen to the
Serbs, causing deep embarrassment to the international community which
had pledged to protect them.
Claes said it was no longer possible to limit Nato action to within a
12-mile radius of the safe areas.
''We need much more flexibility and the action zones must be much
bigger,'' he said, adding that the United Nations was still responsible
for ordering military action in Bosnia.
* Britain is donating 820 pints of blood to the former Yugoslavia in
response to an urgent request from the World Health Organisation.
The Overseas Development Administration is paying for the delivery of
the blood, which has been donated by the Wessex and Scottish blood
transfusion authorities.
It will be used to boost hospital supplies in the Sarajevo area, which
are running dangerously low.
The Royal Air Force will fly the supplies to Split, from where they
will continue their journey by road.
The ODA has provided #270m in emergency help to the region since the
beginning of the crisis.--Reuter.

Vero Beach, Wednesday
HURRICANE Erin weakened to a tropical storm as it swept over the
Florida peninsula early today, knocking down fences, trees, and power
lines, but causing little serious damage.
An emergency manager in Brevard County, on the eastern coast, said
there were reports of widespread power cuts, electricity lines dangling
over roads, traffic lights out, and windows blown out.
Tonight eight crew members from the casino cruise ship the Club Royale
were plucked from life rafts 90 miles off the Florida coast by US Coast
Guard helicopters. Three others were missing.
Erin, rated a minimal hurricane with highest sustained winds of 85mph,
raced ashore near Fort Pierce, about 125 miles north of Miami at about
2am.
Trees bent and branches tore loose in the high winds, and big waves
pounded central Florida's beaches.
Six hours later, the storm was just east of Zephyr Hills, 35 miles
north-east of Tampa, and moving north-west at 17mph.
Erin was expected to cross the Gulf of Mexico at midday and hit land
again over the Florida Panhandle. However Bob Burpee, director of the
National Hurricane Centre, said it was unlikely to regain hurricane
strength of 74mph.
Officials had ordered 100,000 residents on barrier islands off Central
Florida to evacuate yesterday.
Authorities kept police and emergency workers on standby today and
warned residents to stay inside, but media reports indicated people were
leaving hurricane shelters to return home.
The international airports in Fort Lauderdale, West Palm Beach, and
Orlando reopened this morning, though some airlines cancelled flights.
* The worst floods in a century along the Huhne river in China have
left 60 people dead or missing.
Thousands of troops have been mobilised to evacuate one million
residents of north-eastern Liaoning province from the raging waters. The
river, swollen by torrential rainstorms, burst its banks at the weekend.
More than 970,000 people have been evacuated by the army and police,
with at least 3.2 million people affected by the floods.
* More than 2000 Filipinos fled for their lives today when steaming
rivers of mud slammed into two villages at the foot of Pinatubo volcano
in the northern Philippines.
Heavy monsoon rains sent tonnes of ash and mud careering down heavily
silted rivers towards the isolated hamlets of San Juan and Santo Nino.
There were no reports of casualties.--Reuter.

Srinagar, Wednesday
MILITANTS holding five Westerners hostage in strife-torn Kashmir today
repeated a threat to kill the captive tourists.
Al-Faran, the group which has claimed responsibility for abducting the
tourists, denied news reports that it had asked for a ransom in exchange
for release of the hostages, now in their fourth week of captivity.
The statement blamed Indian government ''stooges'' for reports that
Al-Faran had asked for a ransom, and accused the government of trying to
harm the hostages.
''If the government does not change its policy, whatever happens to
the hostages after this will be the government's responsibility,'' it
said.
''Under these circumstances, the hostages could be killed, for which
the government will be responsible.''
It was the first public statement by Al-Faran since July 23 when it
said one of the five hostages was in serious condition after a gunbattle
with Indian security forces. Indian officials denied any clash took
place.
An Indian Government spokesman, Kulbushan Jandyal, said the hostages
were safe, but he refused to comment further.
The government claims it knows where the captives are but has
refrained from attempting a rescue because of threats that the
kidnappers would kill the hostages.
Al-Faran, which before the abductions was unknown even among
separatist groups in Kashmir, had demanded earlier that the Indian
Government release 21 jailed separatists in exchange for the hostages.
India rejected the proposed deal.
On July 12, Al-Faran said that if its demands were not met within
three days, it would kill the hostages. Later it extended the deadline
to July 17.
Britons Paul Wells and Keith Mangan, American Donald Hutchings, German
Dirk Hasert, and Norwegian Hans Christian Ostro were abducted while
trekking near Pahalgam, 55 miles from Srinagar, the summer capital of
Jammu and Kashmir.
The latest Al-Faran statement said the Indian Government was
responsible for ''reprehensible'' reports that the militants had asked
for a ransom and that ''the government is indulging in these plots
because it wants to harm the lives of the hostages''.
The government was ''playing with the lives of the five tourists'',
said Al-Faran.--Reuter/AP.

<RECORDNO>977076342</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A LEADING Scottish QC and politician yesterday urged the Government to
invest more money in the Scottish legal system to ensure that justice
was available to everyone.
Mr Menzies Campbell claimed there was something wrong with a system
that made people abandon legal proceedings for purely financial reasons.
Mr Campbell, the Scottish Liberal Democrat spokesman for home and
legal affairs, made his comments in a letter to Scottish Secretary
Michael Forsyth following the publication last week of the annual report
of the Scottish Legal Aid Board (Slab).
Slab is responsible for the administration of legal aid in Scotland,
which last year cost the public purse about #132m.
In his letter to the Scottish Secretary, Mr Campbell said that Slab's
annual report provided ''additional and compelling evidence'' that the
number of people being denied access to justice for financial reasons
was growing.
Mr Campbell added: ''This must be cause for concern. In particular,
the 20% rise in claimants refusing legal aid after an offer of
assistance strongly supports the conclusion that these people cannot
afford the personal contribution being asked of them under the present
system.
''Clearly, there is something wrong with the system if it is leading
people to abandon proceedings for purely financial reasons.
''In a free society, access to justice should not be denied for
arbitrary reasons or for lack of resources. Yet, in Scotland today, an
increasing number of people are not eligible for full legal aid and
cannot afford to pay the contribution demanded of them.
''These are people who are not quite poor enough to receive full legal
aid, and yet do not have sufficient means to meet the costs
themselves.''
Mr Campbell urged the Scottish Secretary to take a fresh look at the
operation of the legal aid system in Scotland and added: ''Without
sufficient resources the system will continue to deny access to justice
to those who need it most.''

<TEXT>
UNITED Nations officials said today that the Croatian Government and
rebel Serbs were mobilising tens of thousands of troops for possible
full-scale war.
Croat forces blasted Serb positions on the eastern approaches to the
rebel stronghold of Knin, keeping up military pressure on the Croatian
Serbs.
The shelling attacks, launched from western Bosnia, came amid signs
that the Zagreb government was poised to seize back the Krajina Serb
region by force.
''In Croatia the troop build-up continues. We now assess there are as
many as 100,000 Croatian soldiers fully mobilised and battle-ready and
as many as 50,000 on the Serb side,'' said UN spokesman Chris Gunness.
With both armies massing troops, prospects for peace looked bleak
before tomorrow's planned talks in Geneva between Croatian government
and Krajina Serb envoys.
Zagreb wants the minority Serbs to accept Croatian rule, with
guarantees of local autonomy.
The Serbs seem unlikely to accept Croatian president Franjo Tudjman's
ultimatum that within 24 hours of the talks they must reopen rail links
and oil pipelines through Krajina.
A Croatian Serb warplane flew into Bosnian airspace over the Bihac
enclave today and left after being spotted and warned by a Nato
surveillance aircraft.
The Krajina Serbs suffered a serious blow when Croatian army and
Bosnian Croat troops captured the Serb towns of Grahovo and Glamoc in
south-west Bosnia last week, severing the main road linking Knin with
Serb-held areas in Bosnia.
The Croats accused the Serbs of shelling government territory around
the town of Gospic, near a tense front line north of Knin.
The Croatian Serb minority, backed by the Yugoslav army, rebelled
against Zagreb's break with Yugoslavia in 1991 and controls about
one-fifth of Croatian territory.
Krajina Serb forces tried to pre-empt a possible Zagreb army assault
last month by attacking the Bihac enclave in north-west Bosnia to secure
supply lines to their territory.
They promised the UN this week that they would withdraw their troops
and heavy weapons from the Bihac pocket. However Gunness said the
Krajina Serb troops had failed to pull out.
Rebel Serb jets bombed Croat forces along the border with Bosnia
yesterday but Croats have continued to shell the border village of
Strmica, east of Knin.
Serb leaders, stunned by Croat battlefield gains, have appealed to
their patrons in Belgrade to come to their aid. Serbian President
Slobodan Milosevic yesterday called on Bosnian President Alija
Izetbegovic and Bosnian Serb army commander General Ratko Mladic to
agree a peace settlement. However Serbia appears intent on avoiding
military intervention in Croatia.
In another development, Britain, its European allies, Russia, and Nato
secretary-general Willy Claus criticised a vote by the US Congress
directing President Bill Clinton to end US participation in the
international arms embargo on the Bosnian Government.
However Clinton and his top aides predicted that they would eventually
prevail in rejecting any unilateral move to end the embargo, which has
hampered the Sarajevo government in its battle with the Bosnian Serbs.
Meanwhile, the UN said it had started to withdraw peacekeepers from
the eastern enclave of Zepa after the French Government ordered its
contingent to leave by tomorrow morning.
Zepa was captured by Bosnian Serb forces last month and the UN
pull-out leaves hundreds of Muslim soldiers and civilians to an
uncertain fate.
UN officials said some 200 Muslims fleeing Zepa may have been rounded
up by Bosnian Serb forces and that hundreds more may be trying to
escape.
Bosnian Serb forces overran Zepa and Srebrenica, both supposed UN
''safe areas'', last month and expelled thousands of Muslims.--Reuter.

Nairobi, Wednesday
KENYAN President Daniel arap Moi unleashed a scathing attack on
Baroness Chalker, Britain's Overseas Development Minister, calling her
''just a woman'' with the attitude of a kindergarten headmistress.
''White people see blacks as nothing. See, this British lady, just a
woman, comes to Kenya and says, 'do this and do that','' Moi told a
group of farmers visiting the presidency in Nairobi.
''It is as if she is handling kindergarten school kids, she is like
their headmistress,'' Moi said in remarks relayed on the Kenyan
television.
The British High Commission earlier said it had noted a previous
attack on Baroness Chalker by the Kenyan Government, but still regarded
Kenya as one of its most significant partners in Africa.
The Commission appeared to be trying to cool the row with its former
colony since a visit by Baroness Chalker last Friday, in which she
linked outstanding British aid to Kenya with progress on human rights
and political and economic reforms.
High Commissioner Simon Hemans denied on Monday that Baroness Chalker
had said the aid was suspended or frozen.
A Kenyan Government statement yesterday criticised Chalker as being
rude, contemptuous, and hostile. It said Nairobi was angered by her
breaching diplomatic etiquette in holding a news conference shortly
before meeting President Moi.
The 70-year-old Kenyan president said today: ''We must be respected.
God gave us this country, and we must be respected.'' His statement also
threatened that Nairobi might not continue its reform programme.
A spokeswoman for the High Commission would not comment on newspaper
reports that the row could affect a long-standing agreement allowing the
British Army to train in northern Kenya.--Reuter.

THE merged British nuclear power company, scheduled for privatisation
next year, is not to have a third deputy chairman, according to its
Scots-born chairman designate, Mr John Robb.
But, despite Mr Robb's denial of a press report that Ministers are
poised to agree further promotion for the group's new chief executive,
Dr Robert Hawley, there are clear signs of a continuing power struggle
at the top of the infant organisation.
Dr Hawley, a former Rolls-Royce/NEI executive and, for the past three
years, chief executive of Nuclear Electric, is apparently lobbying hard
for untrammelled executive authority.
A report in the Guardian yesterday suggested the #3000m sell-off was
again being rocked, less than two weeks after Mr Robb abruptly sacked
Scottish Nuclear chairman Mr James Hann, by a secret deal to give Dr
Hawley even more status by making him a deputy chairman of the combined
company as well.
''It's a bit of speculative journalism. There is no foundation to it.
We've announced our structure and we're sticking to it. How this story
started is a mystery to me,'' Mr Robb told The Herald from his temporary
office in the Department of Trade and Industry in London.
HoldCo, as the sellable bits of Scottish Nuclear and Nuclear Electric
are currently, inelegantly called, already has two nominated deputy
chairmen, Mr John Collier (present full-time chairman of Nuclear
Electric) and Dr Robin Jeffrey (chief executive of Scottish Nuclear).
Dr Jeffrey's place was to have gone to Mr Hann, until Mr Robb called
Mr Hann to London and asked him to resign. Now Dr Jeffrey will sit on
the main board (in Edinburgh) as one of Mr Robb's deputies while, back
in East Kilbride, he will be both chairman and chief executive of the
Scottish Nuclear subsidiary which will continue to run the Torness and
Hunterston stations.
Dr Hawley will see that unusual arrangement as a potential brake on
his own authority as group chief executive, and he won't be slow to make
his views known.
At the weekend he was complaining to the Sunday Express that
executives in the new company will be badly underpaid. The Guardian
story may not be true, as Mr Robb asserts. But sources confirm that Dr
Hawley would very much like it to be.
Asked if his two deputy chairmen would fulfil essentially
non-executive roles on the holding company board, Mr Robb said: ''I
don't see it that way. I'm not distinguishing between executive and
non-executive roles because they're both full-time employees and these
are usually in executive positions on boards.''
HoldCo still has to announce the names of two non-executives, one each
from Scottish Nuclear and Nuclear Electric, who will join the new board.
Mr Robb says he also intends to recruit two more independent
non-executives from the wider business community.
But, after Scottish Nuclear's doughty though unsuccessful fight to be
privatised as a separate entity, bolstered by taking over some of
Nuclear Electric's stations, all eyes will continue to be on the
emerging balance of power within the merged operation, a balance which,
so far, seems to be swinging Nuclear Electric's way.
Apart from the company secretary, Mr Robert Armour, Dr Jeffrey is so
far the only senior executive figure from Scottish Nuclear to make it to
the main holding company board. If other senior executive roles, just
outwith board level, also go to Nuclear Electric people, Dr Jeffrey will
look even more isolated.
Asked by The Herald if he, Dr Hawley and the group finance director Mr
Michael Kirwan would be moving their homes to Scotland when the proposed
Edinburgh corporate headquarters opens, Mr Robb said: ''I'm not. When I
was appointed I made it clear that, if they wanted someone to reside in
Scotland, much as I love my birthplace, it just isn't appropriate at
this stage in my life.''
But he added: ''As for the others, the answer is yes.'' Mr Robb went
on to hope that no-one in Scotland would expect them to spend all their
time here, given the work to be done in England and further afield.

IAM a GP and I'm not a happy person. I don't know a GP who is. We are
all miserable and worried, and that can't be good for ourselves or our
patients. General practice has hit the wall and bits are falling off as
it slowly disassembles before our eyes.
No-one, neither the public, nor the administrators of the NHS nor the
politicians, seems to have noticed and it's a shame because soon there
won't be any general practice and you won't have a GP.
Young doctors are voting with their feet and simply not entering
practice. In one West of Scotland GP training scheme six GP trainees
started their training on Tuesday instead of 25. The hospital component
of the GP course has closed down because there were no interested
doctors and many of those in post are Irish or German. Older GPs are
looking for early retirement as lemmings look for a cliff and with no
doctors coming along behind in the foreseeable future, who is going to
look after you when you need looking after.
You may or may not care about all this but general practice is like
insurance, you don't worry about it until you need it but when you do
need it it had better be there. Soon general practice won't be there,
certainly not in the form it now is, so what has gone wrong? Why are
doctors voting with their feet? Everything seems to be just as it was
before 1990 -- but it isn't.
The critical year was 1990, the year that the Government imposed a new
contract which the GPs said couldn't work and it didn't. The contract
gave GPs a lot more work to do, but that problem was rapidly overcome by
the doctors who simply took a good look at their practices and increased
their efficiency by the use of computers among other things including
the employment of practice nurses.
The change which started in 1990 was more subtle and more amazing
because it has now all but destroyed general practice. To fully
understand it you would have to spend a little time in a practice,
perhaps be a fly on the wall.
Forget about the TV documentaries and the TV drama, you would have to
see it for real. You should have been with me on my last night on call.
Being on call is stressful even if you aren't called. Being on call is
working, but of course you are called. My first call was for a child
with tummy pains. When I entered the living-room of the house the child
was watching television, as was her father. He was watching Ruby Wax and
he didn't look up or acknowledge my presence in any way.
How do you do that when someone comes into your room? He continued to
watch Ruby Wax until I had examined the child and pronounced her to be
fit. I was irritated not because of his lack of courtesy but because he
obviously wasn't in the least concerned about the child.
This wasn't the worried parent at the bedside, the stuff of television
drama, this was indifference, but if he wasn't concerned about the child
why did he call me out?
I did several more calls with the last at 10 past midnight in the sort
of rain fire departments provide for movies. The parents were in bed but
they got up for me. Their one-year-old had a temperature. The
temperature had been there for two days but they were worried. Why? We
have abolished diphtheria, tetanus, polio, measles and just about
everything else, but I was told that the gran had advised an antibiotic.
I slept the restless sleep of the on-call doctor. At the start of the
emergency surgery I had to do the next morning I was told that a girl
had had an asthma attack and had stopped breathing. I ran from the
building and covered the four miles to the house at speed leaving rubber
on the road.
The girl was in alone. She didn't have asthma and she hadn't stopped
breathing. When I got back to the surgery half-an-hour later I found
myself apologising to the patients for keeping them waiting, even though
I had thought I was saving a life. The first six emergency patients, yes
six in a row, said they had sore throats though I could detect nothing
wrong with them. I gave them all penicillin.
This is fantasy medicine. It is soul destroying. It is an epidemic to
match the great plague of 1349. In 1990 an arrogant Government told
patients that they had rights and charters, but not that they had
obligations. They didn't tell patients that the Government pays just
over #11 per annum per patient for the provision of 24 hours a day 365
days a year medical cover and try to get a service contract for your
washing machine with that.
They told people they had a Rolls-Royce while they were paying for a
MOT-failed moped. Patients have voted with their feet too. They now
demand 24 hours a day general practice, pizza-style medicine delivered
to the home, but they don't get it from me. I can't work 24 hours a day
several days a week and still care for my terminally ill patients and my
depressed patients and all the others who need me to be fit and alert
during the day, not to mention my wife and family.
What has come over people? Have the Thatcher years produced a
generation of people who know what they want and do not care how they
get it or what the consequences of their demands will be?
Those of us at the sharp end of this provision of medical care have no
doubts. The effects of this on the future of general practice are there
for all to see. If it is to survive it must change, probably by the
provision of emergency treatment centres to which patients will come out
of hours. It will never be a Rolls-Royce, but it might yet become a
serviceable moped.

<RECORDNO>977076348</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A SOCIAL work department was alleged to be in the grip of a
Masonic-based mafia which was ''anti-Pakistani'' in nature, a sheriff
was told yesterday.
The claim against the Renfrewshire area department of Strathclyde
Regional Council led to a police investigation when the person said to
have made the accusation allegedly offered to arrange referrals to a
residential home for the elderly on payment of #150 per person.
The allegations were made as an appeal tribunal resumed at Paisley
Sheriff Court in which Dr Sohail Chaudhry is trying to clear his name
after his Caldwell House residential home, Uplawmoor, Renfrewshire, had
its registration cancelled by Strathclyde's social work department last
December amid claims of neglect.
The tribunal, with Sheriff Principal Robert Hay as chairman, had
earlier heard claims from various witnesses that Dr Chaudhry had been
''hounded and harassed'' over a six-year period by senior social worker
Davina Young, who is said to have waged a one-woman campaign against his
establishment.
The latest claims were made by the Rev William Kenny, who had spent
six months helping as an unpaid volunteer at Caldwell House in 1993.
He said he had been invited to help out at the home and was impressed
with the standard of care being provided, but was dismayed when he began
to hear that staff and residents feared Mrs Young, and did their best to
keep out of the way whenever she appeared.
He had been surprised to learn that Dr Chaudhry was prepared to give
up running ''such a lovely home'' and decided to confront the social
worker over reports he'd heard about the ill will she had generated.
He had been told by residents that Mrs Young did not like Pakistanis
and felt they came from the wrong culture to be able to provide care in
such a setting.
When he tried to raise these and other issues with her, he got nowhere
as she continually claimed the matters he referred to were confidential.
Mr Kenny, 69, said he was alarmed after four men, including one who he
understood to be an employee of Glasgow District Council, came to the
home early in 1993.
After they left, Dr Chaudhry revealed to him that Glasgow city
employee had told him it was inevitable that the home would close . . .
and that the Renfrewshire social work department was run by a
Masonic-inspired mafia who were anti-Pakistani. He also said that if Dr
Chaudhry was prepared to pay him #150 for referrals he would get ''as
many residents as he wanted''.
Mr Kenny, said that two weeks later, the same individual phoned the
home and repeated the claims to him over the telephone.
He was so alarmed at what he heard, he asked for a meeting with Mr
Chris Jay, who was the region's senior depute director of social work.
Mr Kenny was then questioned by detectives, but informed them that
they had been given ''misleading'' information when they said they were
investigating claims that a ''mafia'' was operating along with the
individual who had made the claims.
The minister, a former Renfrewshire county councillor who served on
the social work committee, said he had dealt with many social workers
during his life but never experienced anyone like Davina Young who was
''carried away with her power'.
The tribunal continues.

ONE of two men accused of putting a solicitor through a terrifying
ordeal has been cleared.
Mr Kevin Bruce, 31, was acquitted when charges against him were
dropped yesterday.
He and Mr Robert King, 42, of Magdalene Drive, Edinburgh, were accused
of assaulting solicitor Nigel Beaumont and preventing him from leaving a
house where he had been interviewing a witness.
The assault charge against Mr King was also dropped, but he still
faces charges of breach of the peace and attempting to pervert the
course of justice by trying to intimidate Mr Beaumont in relation to a
forthcoming court case.
His solicitor, Mr Vincent Belmonte, asked Sheriff Isobel Poole at
Edinburgh Sheriff Court to rule that there was no case for him to answer
on those charges. She will give her decision tomorrow.

TWO Highland MPs are to meet the EU's Transport Commissioner, Mr Neil
Kinnock, to see if any European regulations on transport and competition
can be invoked to save the Skye to Kyle of Lochalsh ferry.
Western Isles MP, Mr Calum MacDonald, and Ross, Cromarty and Skye MP,
Mr Charles Kennedy, travelled to Skye yesterday to meet campaigners from
the Skye Bridge Appeal Group and the Skye Boat Company to assess the
prospects of maintaining a ferry service to create competition for the
bridge, which is due to open in October with the highest tolls in
Europe.
The Caledonian MacBrayne ferry between Kyle of Lochalsh and Kyleakin
is to be withdrawn when the bridge opens.
The MPs are also calling on the Rail Users Consultative Committee for
Scotland to test in the Court of Session that part of the 1993 Railways
Act on the consultative procedures for the withdrawal of ferry services.
The committee's predecessor body, the Transport Users Consultative
Committee for Scotland, had exercised unchallenged the right to call
public inquiries into ferry withdrawals. The Government argues that this
right never existed in law, but has told the committee to hire a lawyer
to advise it on this matter.
Mr MacDonald said yesterday: ''This is an issue which is relevant not
only to Skye, but also to the Western Isles and the Highlands of
Scotland. We can not allow this disgraceful toll regime to become
mandatory. Competition has to be allowed and every effort possible will
be made to achieve this.''
Mr Kennedy agreed: ''We are determined to force proper consultation
and fair play, both over the future of the present ferry service and a
potential future service as an alternative to the bridge.''

<HEADLINE>Young Pretender's first stop was at Colonsay, says island folklore</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>977076353</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
SCOTLAND'S history books might have to be rewritten over a key part of
the story of Bonnie Prince Charlie's 1745 Jacobite Rebellion.
For people on the island of Colonsay believe the Young Pretender's
first footsteps on Scotland were made not on Eriskay, in the Outer
Hebrides, but on their isle 100 miles away.
The dispute could embarrass the celebrations to mark the prince's
''official'' first landing on Scottish soil.
The claims are made in a reissued book on the history of Colonsay,
which lies nine miles off Jura at the southern end of the Inner
Hebrides.
Locals believe information handed down proves the prince spent a whole
day on the island negotiating to win islanders' support and to let him
store his gold there.
But local folklore states that the then owners, the MacNeills, refused
his request as they had pledged allegiance to the Duke of Argyll and the
Campbells.
They did, however, provide two pilots, Hector and Iain MacMillan, to
guide the royal ship through the treacherous Hebridean waters to Eriskay
. . . for a purse of gold each.
One of the brothers, Hector, swam ashore when he realised what the
expedition was all about. But Iain stuck with the prince and eventually
escaped to France.
The story was first recorded last century by archaeologist and
historian Symington Grieve, of Edinburgh, and has since been repeated in
two other books. One of these, Colonsay and Oronsay, written in 1935 by
John De Vere Loder, later Lord Wakehurst, has just been reissued.
Mr Kevin Byrne has run the 11-bedroom Colonsay Hotel since 1978 and
has a small bookshop in the foyer which sells the book.
He said: ''I have heard this story many times since I moved here and
I, along with the rest of the population here, believe it to be true.
Islay would have been the most natural landing spot for the prince but
that was Clan Campbell territory, which would have ruled it out.''
The current owner, Lord Strathcona (Donald Euan Howard) is a nephew of
the book's author and has written a new introduction to the work, which
was published by the island's publishing house, Colonsay Press.
Lord Strathcona, a wartime naval officer and a Defence Minister in
Margaret Thatcher's Government, said: ''There is a lot to be said for
the traditions of Gaelic-speaking islanders, who are known for their
honesty and integrity. I think it is very possible that it is a true
story.''
In 1904 the estate was sold to Donald Smith, who had left the
Morayshire town of Forres in 1836 and made his fortune in Canada. He was
raised to the peerage in 1897 by Queen Victoria, taking the title Lord
Strathcona and Mount Royal, from his Scottish estate in Glencoe and from
Montreal, headquarters of the Hudson Bay Company.
The claims have been met with apathy on Eriskay.
Fr Calum MacLellan, of St Michael's RC Parish Church, said: ''Whatever
the truth of the matter is, Eriskay still lays claim to the first
landing 250 years ago.''
He added: ''Good luck to the people of Colonsay if they think it will
benefit their island's history. We have had no benefit economically,
emotionally, intellectually, or even spiritually, believing he landed
here first.''

AN exhibition featuring one of the finest private collections of
Scottish art opens today at the National Gallery in Edinburgh.
International investment bankers Flemings, set up in 1873 by Dundonian
Robert Fleming, have amassed more than 800 oils and watercolours, of
which 60 of the finest are on display.
Hidden Assets features a range of Scottish art from 1820 to 1920
including works by Peploe, Naysmith, McTaggart, Wilkie, Hunter, and
Pryde. Also among them are Sir James Gunn's tranquil evocation of
soldiers bathing on the eve of the Battle of the Somme, and two
celebrated images of nineteenth century West Highland emigration, Thomas
Faed's The Last of the Clan and John Watson Nichol's Lochaber No More.
It is the first major public showing of the Flemings collection and
the National Gallery's first corporate exhibition of Scottish paintings.
It is free and open to the public until September 24.

THE heatwave hitting Scotland could severely hamper life-saving rescue
operations, a coastguard official warned yesterday.
A massive zone of high pressure is causing heavy interference on
emergency radio channels, and could jeopardise a sea rescue, said a
spokesman for Aberdeen coastguard.
He warned: ''It is a freak situation. The huge area of high pressure
might be great for holidaymakers, but it causes havoc on our airwaves.
''We're picking up a huge amount of background noise from as far
afield as Dublin and Norway because of the clear weather. Normally the
area affected by this sort of thing would be fairly small.''
The spokesman added: ''It could, conceivably, hamper our efforts in an
emergency situation. There's nothing we can do except try and use
different channels.''
Pressure readings across the north of Scotland are standing at 1027
millibars.
Meanwhile, Aviemore was yesterday's Highland hot-spot -- soaring to
30C by mid-afternoon -- as most of the north wilted in the sun.
But while inland and easterly areas of the Highlands sizzled, the west
coast cooled considerably in sea breezes.
There were blue skies everywhere, but places such as Ullapool and
Mallaig were a good 10 degrees cooler than Aviemore.
Inverness, meanwhile, had the lazy air of a Mediterranean town as
large numbers of exhausted pedestrians sat on shaded pavements and
office workers leaned out of town centre windows, for fresh air.
There was also good news from a spokesman for Aberdeen Met Office, who
revealed: ''It looks like the settled spell will spill over into next
week, and the weekend should certainly be another scorcher.
''The seasonal average is a good 10 degrees cooler. It is quite
extraordinary,'' he added.
A Northern Constabulary spokesman said there had been a large number
of calls warning of children diving into the Caledonian Canal at
Inverness.

DISGRUNTLED councillors in the Western Isles are teaming up to try to
make their convener and vice-convener the only ones in Scotland who
would have to stand for re-election every year.
The council's five-strong Labour group has thrown its weight behind
the controversial plan first mooted last week by Councillor Colin
Campbell of Benbecula.
The plan for annual re-election of the two top councillors is now
likely to be discussed at the next series of council meetings later this
month.
Labour group leader Callum Ian Macmillan (Aignish) said: ''We fully
support these moves to make the leadership more accountable to the
members.
''A lot of members of the council are under the impression that there
is too much power in the hands of a very small group.''
The move follows claims from Mr Campbell about members being kept in
the dark and obsessive secrecy.
Backing for annual re-election has also come from the fledgling SNP
group. The party's Mr Alasdair Nicholson (Coll), said: ''I believe that
a responsible and good convener would have nothing to fear.
''The leadership would have to be more receptive to the feelings of
colleagues and the community.'' Last week convener Donald M Mackay had
to apologise to North Uist Councillor Ena MacNeill. No-one had told her
Scottish Office Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton was visiting her
ward on Thursday.
Mr Campbell also wrote to ask for an explanation why Mr Mackay and
chief executive Brian Stewart had not told him of a meeting they had on
Benbecula to discuss contracts at the Army base.
He said the convener's reply was that the visit was private and had
nothing to do with him.
Mr Campbell claims these two incidents are just the latest examples of
obsessive secrecy and lack of consultation, like the withholding from
councillors of the Aspinwall report on the environmental impact of the
planned Lingerbay superquarry.
Barra councillor Captain Roddy Mackinnon (Northbay) supported the move
but stressed he was not advocating the removal of the current convener
and vice-convener. He thought no-confidence votes were ''messy''.
Mr Mackay said: ''Annual election of the convener and vice-convener
does not happen in other authorities and could cause disruption. I'll be
happy to talk about it if the subject is raised at the next meetings.''

RARE wild flowers are putting the rough on a Scottish golf course out
of bounds to players . . .
Wild orchids are growing beside the fairways, and Government watchdogs
are keen to protect them. Now Newtonmore Golf Club, in the Highlands, is
expecting a cash injection from Scottish Natural Heritage.
And 450 members of the club in Speyside will just have to put up with
losing more balls than usual to help preserve the rare plants.
The money will be paid to the club to protect the eight varieties of
scarce wild orchids which thrive there.
The wildlife watchdogs are giving the money to ensure that the rough
between the 11th and 16th holes remain uncut during the crucial growing
season for the plants.
Yesterday Audrey Edgar, the area officer for Scottish Natural
Heritage, said: ''Newtonmore golf course is important because there are
so many varieties of orchids in such a small area. That is why we are
negotiating a management agreement with the club , which is right next
door to the Insh Marshes nature reserve''.
The century-old club, whose course is 5880 yards long, is also in the
finals of a contest with a top prize of #5000 run by two private
ground-care firms to find Britain's ''greenest' course.
A spokesman for the organisers confirmed that the course, near the
banks of the River Spey in the foothills of the Cairngorms, was
inspected yesterday by one of their representatives, because it has
reached the last four in Scotland in the Golf Environment Competition.
Club secretary Richard Cheyne, an electrician, of Clune Terrace,
Newtonmore, Inverness-shire, said yesterday: ''We agreed not to burn the
rough this year as we are in the final stages of negotiating a monetary
agreement with SNH.''
He added: ''Letting the grass grow wild in the rough will pose a
problem for some of our members, but our fairways here are quite wide.
We are pleased to co-operate because a lot of the members are keen that
we play our part in conserving nature.''
For the record, Newtonmore's unique orchid collection consists of the
following: large butterfly, fragrant, frog arch, small white, northern
marsh, common spotted, early marsh and heath spotted.

A MOTHER and her youngest daughter died yesterday when a car ploughed
into them after the driver suffered a heart attack as temperatures
soared to 93F.
The 62-year-old driver of the Austin Allegro estate car was also
killed in the accident on the A37 Wells Road near Bristol city centre.
Last night the RAC, Age Concern and the British Heart Foundation
warned that elderly drivers should take extra safety precautions.
Mrs Janet Martin, 37, and her three daughters -- Tara, nine, Kim,
seven, and Jasmina, three -- were wheeling their bikes along the
pavement in Whitchurch, Bristol, when the accident happened. Jasmina was
hurled 50 ft through the air by the impact. Mrs Martin was thrown 20 ft.
The two older daughters witnessed the crash and were treated for
shock.
A woman car passenger -- thought to be the wife of the driver -- was
also taken to hospital after suffering bruises and whiplash injuries.
Last night, Mr Michael Martin, 43, cuddled his daughters Tara and Kim
at the family home in Hengrove, Bristol, as he said: ''God must have
been short of a couple of angels. Now he's got two of the best.
''Janet was the most caring, loving mother in the whole world and I
know that she will be glad to have died with Jasmina because she
couldn't have lived without her.
''Jasmina was a beautiful little thing. She was the life and soul of
the street.''
Mr Martin, a Securicor driver, added: ''A policeman said that the
driver of the car had had a heart attack. It just swerved off the road
and hit Janet and Jasmina. They were just in the wrong place at the
wrong time.
''I don't feel any anger towards the driver because I know it wasn't
his fault. I know that it is a bad day for both families.''
Fire brigade spokesman, station officer Geoff Cater, said: ''It is
still not clear precisely what happened. It seems that the mother and
child received massive head injuries and were killed instantly.''
The estate car struck the post of a speed camera as it left the road.
Last night police were examining the wreckage of the camera for clues.
The British Heart Foundation yesterday warned that older people were
especially prone to heart attacks in intense heat. Ms Belinda Linden,
Nurse Adviser for the BHF, said: ''The body's temperature control system
becomes less efficient when people are older.
''Extremes of temperature -- either very hot or very cold weather --
can lead to heart attacks.''
RAC spokesman Peter Brill said: ''We are telling drivers to take care
when driving in high temperatures. They need to ventilate their cars as
best they can.''

SCOTTISH miners afflicted by pneumoconiosis do particularly badly when
it comes to getting compensation, according to evidence presented
yesterday by the TUC to the Industrial Injuries Advisory Council, which
is currently reviewing the rules.
The problem is that the disease is rare in the Scottish coal fields
and, as a result, fewer claimants pass the ''pneumo-test'' for
compensation. The TUC's analysis revealed that only 11% of claimants in
Glasgow and 16% in Edinburgh were successful.
Mr John Monks, general secretary of the TUC, said the treatment of
lung disease victims was ''callous and unjust''. The pneumo-test should
be scrapped and the FEV1 test, which assesses how breathless a victim
is, should be made more flexible.
He also called for a relaxation in the rules governing compensation
claims to enable more miners to qualify. Some 3000 miners have received
awards although 10 times that number have claimed.
Those who pass the pneumo-test can get up to #95 a week in industrial
injuries benefits. Under current rules, miners and ex-miners suffering
from chronic bronchitis and emphysema must prove they also have

THE Scottish Secretary, Mr Michael Forsyth, has been urged to make
sure that Scottish councils get their share of EU grants to revitalise
former mining areas.
Lothians Euro MP David Martin said yesterday that central and local
government was required to match the #8.3m of European funding which was
on offer with #8.9m of their own.
But the UK had all but abandoned regional policy, and local
communities in Scotland depended on European Regional Funding to revive
their economies and create jobs, he said.
Areas which could benefit are Bathgate, Midlothian and Kirkcaldy.

AN MP has called for an apology from lawyers involved in the Ayrshire
child abuse case, after a decision by the Lord Advocate that none of the
social workers involved will face prosecution.
Mr George Foulkes, MP for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley, said that
the members of Strathclyde region social work department had been ''put
through months of hell'' and the time had come for a public apology.
He was speaking after a letter from Lord Rodger informed him that
''the most careful consideration has been given to the matter and it has
been decided that criminal proceedings will not be instituted''.
One of the lawyers involved, however, dismissed the call for an
apology as ''misplaced and inappropriate''.
There had been calls earlier this year for a specific inquiry into the
role of social workers and possible criminal proceedings after
Scotland's most senior judge, Lord Hope, ruled that eight children held
in care for almost five years should return to their families.
Lord Hope made his ruling after considering a report from Sheriff
Colin Miller, compiled after a 169-day inquiry, into allegations of
ritual sex abuse involving eight children from three families. He called
the case ''a tragedy of immense proportions''.
The children had been taken into care in 1990 after Sheriff Neil Gow
ruled that, in his opinion, there was clear evidence of abuse in the
case.
Mr Foulkes said last night: ''I now believe that the lawyers who acted
irresponsibly, albeit in the heat of a highly-charged moment, in calling
for criminal proceedings should make a public apology.''
Ayr solicitor Mr Michael Johnston, who acts for one of the families,
said: ''My recollection is that at no time did I call for any individual
social worker to be prosecuted, and it has always been my understanding
that the Crown Office was looking into the case because of comments made
by Sheriff Miller about some of the evidence given by social workers.
''I feel that any call for an apology is misplaced and inappropriate,
and I would point out that at no time has there been an apology to any
of the families from Strathclyde region or its social work department.''
Mr Johnston disclosed that compensation is being sought by the
families.
Meanwhile, new guidelines for the investigation of such cases are
expected to be released by the Scottish Office today.

THE waiting is over. Buff envelopes will begin falling on doormats all
over Scotland with the results of this year's Standard and Higher grade
exams.
Some 124,274 envelopes were posted first class yesterday by the
Scottish Examination Board for delivery this morning to 64,130
candidates who sat Standard grade exams and 60,144 in groups of subjects
containing at least one Higher grade.
Until now Scottish pupils only find out when results will arrive a few
days before they are entrusted to the Post Office. The only guarantee
from the SEB has been that the candidates would know the results by
August 10 -- before they had gnawed their nails down to their knuckles.
However, the system came in for criticism from careers advisers who
felt it should be changed to mirror that in England where candidates
know the date they will receive their results up to a year beforehand.
Yesterday as the Post Office carted off sackfuls of results, an SEB
spokesman said it was considering changing to a fixed date for
publishing exam results.
The spokesman said the board would go out to consultation on the
matter and meet in the autumn or early next year to consider the switch.
Meanwhile, 3600 Higher grade candidates will receive results which are
based on their teachers' estimates of how well they were expected to
perform compared with how they actually did when they came to put pen to
paper.
Such a system already exists for the Standard grades but this is the
first time the initiative has applied to Higher grade candidates. The
SEB spokesman said 3600 pupils had been raised a grade or more.
The initiative is geared to ensure that a pupil does not suffer
unfairly because of a poor showing on the day of an exam.
Three helplines will be open today to help pupils decide how to make
the most of their results.
The Exam Results Helpline on 0800 100 900 will offer teenagers instant
access to specialist advisers who have the latest Scottish course
vacancy details.
A spokesman for the advisers said: ''This is an opportunity to get
bang up-to-date information and advice quickly and there's no need to
worry about hefty telephone bills. We can help look at their options,
perhaps changing to a course or institution demanding lower
qualifications. Remember speed is essential as colleges and universities
make their final selection for courses once the results are out.
''It can be very tempting to snatch at the first course that crosses
your path. Every year we get calls at the Careers Office from people
saying they'll do any course, anywhere, but this is not a good move.
It's important to explore all the options before making a decision. The
course has to be right for you if you want to succeed in higher
education.''
A second line will be operated by Strathclyde Careers Service on 0800
838 122. The unit, which operates throughout the year, was set up nearly
six years ago and staff handle nearly 13,000 inquiries each year.
A third -- 0800 077 077 -- will be run by the BBC.
Inquiries about non-delivery of results can be made to the Post Office
after 10am tomorrow. The numbers are 0131 458 8648 or 0131 458 8650.
* A telephone helpline has also been set up to counsel youngsters
disappointed with their exam results.
Ms Marjorie Young, one of the leaders of the Scotland-wide initiative
set up to coincide with the release of exam results this week, said:
''Obviously we hope we will not be inundated with calls but the service
is a valuable one.
''We can help young people look at their options and perhaps set them
on course for a career that requires less demanding academic
qualifications.''
The freephone helpline number is 0800 100 900.

A RAPIST who claimed in court he was a Christian charity worker was
told yesterday he faces a possible life sentence for the rape of a
22-year-old Eastbourne student.
Lewes Crown Court was told that William Stevenson, 28, had two
previous convictions for violent assaults on women in Scotland,
including one when he tried to strangle a woman in her own home.
During his trial 17-stone Stevenson claimed he was given the money for
his weekend away by the Rev Keith Stevens, a Church of Scotland
minister, as a treat for charity work at a Christian drop-in centre in
Ellesmere Street, Possilpark, Glasgow.
Rev Stevens had only met Stevenson once, when he had asked for money
to travel to England to sort out family problems.
Stevenson had denied rape and another serious sexual offence but was
convicted by the jury on Monday. He was cleared of a charge of stealing
#24 from the woman.
Yesterday, Judge Alastair Troup remanded him in custody until
September 4 for psychiatric reports.

AN assurance that there is no effect on patient care because Aberdeen
Royal Hospitals Trust is three months late in signing agreements with
its two major purchasers was given yesterday.
A trust spokesman stressed there was no financial crisis and the
agreements were now on the point of being signed.
He said that the trust, which in January was heading for a #1m deficit
by the end of the financial year because of ''a particularly busy
spell'', had in fact met its financial targets in March.
He said that the agreements with Grampian Health Board and the GP
fundholders were normally signed in May but for a variety of reasons,
including the constantly changing medical requirements, they had been
prolonged.
''There is no cash crisis,'' he said. ''We are close to signing the
agreements and there is no effect on patient care.'' Dr June Fettes,
executive manager for the GP fundholders in Grampian, confirmed the
situation and said that, while it was not a very happy situation, it was
for reasons beyond the control of the fundholders and to some extent the
trust.
She said numerous other contracts had to be agreed before the
contracts with the two major purchasers could be finalised.
The only thing delayed was the invoicing cycle and there was no change
in patient care.

THE number of fish processors in the UK has fallen by 30%, with a 50%
decrease in Grampian, according to the initial results of a survey
carried out by the Sea Fish Authority.
The results may confirm the fears of the processors, who until now
have been unable to back their calls for help with any evidence,
although it is too early to say whether there has been a severe
reduction in capacity.
Mr Robert Milne, chief executive of the Scottish Fish Merchants'
Federation, said: ''For a number of years we have been saying that
companies are going out of business but we have had no concrete facts.
''I asked the Sea Fish Authority to devote money or staff to look into
this and it agreed to allocate #50,000.''
The first phase of the first major survey of the fish processing
sector for a decade suggests there are now around 700 processors in the
UK compared to 988 in 1986.
The number of processors in Grampian has almost halved and the number
in Humberside has declined by more than 40%. The only areas where
numbers have increased are Southern England which is up 25% and
Highlands and Islands which is up 18%.
''Aberdeen and Humberside are the two main processing areas for the
UK. There are pockets of processing elsewhere and although they may have
increased by 18% it is not comparing like with like and it is 18% of not
a great deal,'' Mr Peter Chaplin, chief executive of the Sea Fish
Industry Authority, said.

A MINOR electrical fault in a tug postponed the departure of the
world's first ocean-based wave power electricity generator at the UIE
shipyard in Clydebank yesterday.
The two mega-watt, 850 tonne steel Osprey (Ocean Swell Powered
Renewable Energy) system, the innovation of an Inverness company, was
due to begin its four-day tow to a site off the coast at Dounreay where
it will be plugged into the national grid.
However, last night the generator, which is capable of providing power
for a village of 1000 people, remained moored on the Clyde and will
begin its journey today.
Osprey was developed over five years by Applied Research and
Technology in Inverness, which employs 17 people. It generates
electricity while ballasted to the ocean bed by sucking in wave swells
which causes rising air within its body to power turbines in two funnels
six metres above the surface.
The #4m prototype generator, funded by the European Union and a
consortium of the public and private sector in the UK, becomes
operational 18 months after the Department of Trade and Industry
withdrew funding for wave power research on grounds of commercial
viability.
However, at the aborted official launch of Osprey, ART managing
director Mr Allan Thomson said that the generator technology offered
''huge amounts of energy from a virtually limitless source''.
He revealed that several power companies in the US, China and the
Carribean were ''at the stage of sending directors over'' with a view to
importing the Osprey technology.
Mr Thomson added: ''The lack of DTI support was disappointing, but not
altogether surprising. As a commercial enterprise, we expected to have
to stand on our own two feet.
''However, we are confident in the future that the contribution of
wave power to the economy will be recognised and developed.''
Sixty workers were employed at the UIE shipyard during the six-month
construction of Osprey. Mr Thomson said the generator was designed to be
built in any shipyard in the world, but hoped that, if ART won European
orders for Ospreys, generators could be built and shipped out from
Scotland.
Osprey will supply power to Hydro-Electric, as part of the company's
1364MW capacity of renewable energy drawn from sources such wind, solar
and hydro power.
However Hydro generation manager Dr James Martin predicted that if
Osprey is successful, the company planned to use wave power to supply up
to one quarter of its renewable energy in Scotland.
He said: ''The beauty of waves is that they are a very intensive and
dependable power supply. Osprey is still very much at the 'wait and see'
stage, but we are already looking at other potential locations.''
He said the entire western facing coast, where sea currents were
suitably strong was under consideration, but that, at maximum, wave
power would not supply to more than 250,000 people across Scotland.
Art scientific director Dr Alan Wells, whose unique Osprey wave
turbine system is the culmination of 20 years' work said he had ''never
lost faith'' that he would witness its commercial fruition.
He revealed that part of the technology behind Osprey was inspired by
the world's first shoreline wave power generator, at Portnahaven, Islay,
which has been operational since 1991.
The eco-friendly structure of Osprey, which contains a 1.5-mw wind
power generator and can also be used to desalinate sea-water, will act
as an artificial reef to enable lobster farming to take place.

POLICE refused to allow two married officers to work together because
they were worried that defence lawyers would use the relationship to get
criminals off the hook.
Northern Constabulary Chief Inspector William Murray told a resumed
industrial tribunal in Inverness yesterday that a husband and wife
cannot be compelled to give evidence against each other.
He admitted he feared the legal implications of putting married
officers on the same shift and then ending up in court to give evidence
about an incident. He said: ''Defence lawyers could allege collusion
between officers to bring about corroborated evidence.''
Mr Murray was giving evidence in the tribunal hearing brought by
Constable Alexander Dunnett, 42, who is claiming compensation for
injured feelings, alleging the force discriminated against him because
of his marital status.
When he and his 28-year-old wife, Audrey, returned from honeymoon last
September, they were told they would no longer be on the same shifts. As
a result, they said, they hardly saw each other.
An attempt to draw up their own roster to give them some time together
was also dismissed by senior officers.
Mr Murray told the tribunal that the proposed roster was rejected
because Mr and Mrs Dunnett would still have been working a large part of
their shift together.
He added: ''There were other reasons why I thought it was undesirable
for married officers to work on the same shift. Police business is
sometimes confrontational -- they do meet sometimes with verbal abuse,
hindrance, and even assault.
''Colleagues have to deal with situations objectively, but if you get
a spouse arriving at a scene where one has been assaulted, then it may
be the other spouse will react emotionally rather than objectively and
that is the last thing we want to see.''
He admitted Mr Dunnett's shift pattern had been changed because the
two officers got married, but added it would have been changed anyway
due to the ill health of another officer.
He also discounted the possibility of moving Mr Dunnett or his wife to
another station on Skye. ''It was thought about, but it was decided it
wouldn't be fair to ask one of them to make a round trip of 60 miles a
day to work.''
He admitted the force did not have an official policy about married
officers working the same shifts and conceded there were examples of
husband and wife working together in at least four instances.
''There is no official policy but it is recognised by senior staff
that it is undesirable. It has occurred but it doesn't mean that it is
right.''
Force personnel officer Supt Alan Moir said he was one of the senior
officers who prepared the force's equal opportunities policy, which
states officers won't be discriminated against on the grounds of marital
status. But he admitted that Mr Dunnett's marital status did affect his
shifts.
He also confirmed that Northern Constabulary had allowed other married
officers work the same shift.
Mr Dunnett and his wife have now been posted to Thurso, but Mrs
Dunnett is on maternity leave.

THE off-the-field troubles facing Heart of Midlothian Football Club,
whose efforts to fill its vacant manager's post have aroused
controversy, increased yesterday with a fire-raising attack on one of
its vehicles.
A Ford Transit minibus, parked in McLeod Street only yards from the
Tynecastle ground and used for transporting players, was extensively
damaged after a window was broken and paper or cardboard was put in and
ignited.
In addition to considerable smoke damage to the vehicle, seating in
the M-registered, 2[1/2]-litre vehicle, which was set on fire between
9.30pm and 11pm last night, melted.
Lothian and Borders police are treating the incident as ''a deliberate
act of fire-raising''.
In recent days the managements of both the Edinburgh club and of
Premier League colleagues Falkirk have become involved in a public row
centring on Falkirk manager and ex-Hearts player Jim Jefferies.
The Tynecastle side wants Mr Jefferies as its manager and the Falkirk
club has taken steps to try to keep him at Brockville.
Hearts yesterday played down the incident, indicating a child was
likely to have been behind it. A spokesman said they were not linking it
to anything other than ''the normal things that happen in the course of
a year''.
''It's the price you pay for having a football stadium. It's not a
major incident,'' said the spokesman, who indicated the upholsterers had
been called in to repair the vehicle's seats.

A MAJOR row is brewing in Argyll because of a Scottish Office decision
to drop a bridge-building project -- because of other road proposals
which themselves were abandoned.
Campaigners said last night that they would be pressing for the
immediate re-instatement of the #4m project to build a new road bridge
across Loch Creran, south of Ballachulish.
It emerged yesterday that the project was dropped from the Scottish
Office programme because of separate proposals to de-trunk the 28-mile
stretch of route between Connel and Ballachulish.
But these proposals, part of a national trunk road review, were
subsequently withdrawn by the Scottish Office in a widely-hailed U-turn
which was seen as paving the way for the long-awaited bridge.
Campaigners view the bridge project as having the potential to give a
substantial boost to business and tourism by cutting out miles of
circuitous, lochside route between Oban and Fort William.
A Scottish Office spokesman said yesterday that the decision to drop
the project would be reviewed but not until next spring.
He added that roads Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton was ''well
aware'' of local concerns over the project and would take them into
account during his consideration.
Regional councillor Campbell Cameron said that there should be a
commitment by the Scottish Office for an immediate re-instatement of the
project into the programme, with the same start date of next financial
year.
President of Oban and Lorn chamber of commerce, Mr David Webster,
said: ''I am speechless. It's about time the Scottish Office got its act
together and stopped giving short shrift to the Highlands.''

WHILE never a world beater on the tennis courts, David Lloyd has
enjoyed spectacular success with his leisure business group which is now
valued at around #153m.
Yesterday's disclosure that the David Lloyd Leisure group is in
preliminary talks over a possible takeover sent the shares jumping 15p
to 324p, as speculation grew as to the identity of the possible bidders.
Even at the current price, Mr Lloyd's personal holdings are worth
#18.8m. These include his option holdings, where the profit on the
exercise prices would be #3.39m before allowing for tax.
David Lloyd's tennis career reached its zenith when he played in the
doubles semi-finals at Wimbledon.
His other successes were his 10-year participation in the Davis Cup
being picked 15 times. He was also the head coach of the Israeli Tennis
Federation for a year in 1978.
However, while in sporting terms his career might not have been
outstanding, his business aptitude was a somewhat different story.
His subsequent success should have come as no surprise to the Lawn
Tennis Association, with which he was in almost constant strife for many
years.
Among his suggestions to it was that only one person should be in
charge of trying to revitalise British tennis, another that the turf of
Wimbledon be dug up.
In sporting terms, he was always overshadowed by his younger brother
John. John had a variable tennis talent, but became famous after
marrying Chris Evert, the world's number one woman player in 1979.
The games and upsets of the turbulent marriage were documented by
Carol Thatcher, with male admiration rising when he was paid #3m by his
former wife in the divorce settlement in 1986.
David Lloyd founded his company in 1980 based on tennis and fitness
and it went public in 1992. The stock market flotation, with shares
offered at 150p, valued the group at #59m, compared with the current
#153m.
The outstanding success has been the Renfrew club, where membership
has risen from 2400 to 3900, although still in its second year.
Such is the demand that a waiting list has had to be imposed, until an
extension of the club is completed permitting another 600 people to
join.
Proposals for a second club in Glasgow are under negotiation, as are
the first opening in Edinburgh on council-owned land.
Altogether there are 18 clubs, most within the London M25 orbit. These
include the Sharon and Tracey dominated Chigwell, of Birds of a Feather
fame, where the hairstyle colours match those of the BMW convertibles.
Mr Lloyd believes in catching them young. Some 13 clubs already have
creche facilities charging a reasonable #2 a hour and also admit
children of non-members.
Last month, the involvement of youngsters was further increased, with
a #5m purchase of nursery schools catering for the under-fives.
That deal was boosted by the Government's decision to fund pre-school
places from 1997, worth about #1100 per child.
Mr Lloyd has said that profit margins can be as high as 40%. There is
a streak of ruthlessness in his club business. Anyone who fails to turn
up for booked tennis court faces a fine of up to #50.
However, Mr Lloyd defends the rule saying that there is nothing that
causes more complaints than an empty court at a busy time, because a
booking has failed.
The stock market sees three possible bidders for the leisure group.
The most logical would appear to be First Leisure, whose most
conspicuous asset is the Blackpool Tower. However, it also owns a chain
of discotheques, bingo halls, and ten pin bowling alleys.
Its profit record has made it a darling of the stock markets. Scottish
interests, which it is trying to expand, are presently confined to a
disco in Aberdeen and three pubs.
Another candidate appears to be Whitbread, the brewing, Pizza Hut to
Brewers Fayre retailing group.
In the past year, Whitbread has lost out on several large deals,
including bidding for brewers Courage, which is now almost certain to be
taken over by Scottish &amp; Newcastle for #425m.
The third name being touted is the Rank Organisation. Rank, whose
interests include bingo clubs, Butlins holiday camps, and Odeon cinemas
group is looking for new opportunities.
It is too early to say whether any bid will materialise this time
round but the stock market flurry has concentrated attention on the
company.
This is backed by Mr Lloyd's argument that, if Britain had the same
density of leisure clubs as The Netherlands, which is a reasonably
comparable country, there would need to be a 20-fold increase from the
existing 800 to around 16,000 clubs, as the demand for fitness under
supervision continues to grow.

<TEXT>
NEW phone services which allow users to find out who is on the other
end of the line are helping in the fight against malicious and hoax
callers, a British Telecom report showed yesterday.
The number of requests for help from people being pestered by nuisance
callers dropped significantly after the introduction of the ''caller
display'' and ''call return'' in November last year, says the report.
Figures show that more than 1.6m people have asked for help since BT
launched a new offensive against phone pests three years ago.
In 1992, BT set up a national network of bureaux staffed by specialist
investigators trained to help customers being troubed by malicious
calls.
The report shows that the number of cases reported to BT peaked prior
to November last year, with 60,000 new requests for help each month when
the problem was at its height.
There has been a 20% drop in the number of requests for help since the
arrival of ''caller display'', which allows customers to see the number
of the person calling before they answer, and ''call return'', which
allows people to discover the number of the last person to call by

TWO men who forged #10 notes were caught when one of them went on a
spending spree, the High Court in Glasgow heard yesterday.
Ian Bell, 22, of Quarry Street, and John Horne, 21, of Kemp Street,
both Hamilton, admitted making the counterfeit notes and being in
possession of 43 fake notes in High Street, Lanark.
Bell, the son of a Strathclyde detective, also admitted passing the
notes and the reset of two stolen cars.
Lord Coulsfield called for reports and deferred sentence till August
23 at the High Court in Edinburgh.
Mr Iain Bonomy, QC, prosecuting, revealed how the pair were caught
after Bell bought a can of Coke in a Lanark chip shop with a forged
note.
As she was putting it in the till, the girl behind the counter noticed
it didn't feel right and showed the note to the shop owner.
He found Bell in a nearby baker's shop. On being challenged, Bell gave
him a #20 note and got the #10 note back.
But the shop owner went to the police and Bell and Horne were
arrested.
Police searched Bell's home and discovered a photocopier.

<HEADLINE>Post Office to move from building in George Square after 138 years</HEADLINE>

SCOTLAND'S largest post office is to branch out into three new
premises as part of a #3.5m investment to bring postal services in
Glasgow into the 21st century.
The move will end a 138-year residence in the city's George Square
building, which handles 20,000 customers and 1.5 million items of mail a
week, and has been suggested as the site for a new National Gallery of
Scotland.
However, no buyer has yet been found for the five-storey office block
and a Post Office spokesman yesterday dismissed as ''weird speculation''
pronounced options for its future use.
Meanwhile, a flagship post office costing #500,000 is to open in St
Vincent Street next year. It will have level access for disabled people
and a Post Shop, bureau de change, and National Lottery outlet.
The Post Office said the George Square building no longer met its
needs and had been hampered by lack of parking facilities and poor
access, resulting in congestion at peak times.
Mr Douglas Craik, head of retail network for the west of Scotland,
said the new premises would ''improve services to customers and improve
conditions for staff''.
In September, 220 postmen and women will move to a new delivery office
in Baird Street serving 20,000 city centre addresses while 225
administrative staff will move to new offices in the Guild Hall.
Two additional agency offices in Miller Street and Stockwell Street
will complete the diversification and will open in time for Christmas.
The #3.5m scheme is the latest part of the Royal Mail's streamlining
of collection, sorting, and delivery in the city which began with a #26m
hi-tech sorting centre at Springburn.
However, there is no conclusion to the speculation surrounding the
future of the 1857 gothic George Square building with its prestigious
address capable of providing 180,000sq ft of accommodation on five
floors of 34,000sq ft.
The building was put up for sale in May and it is understood that the
Post Office hopes to secure a buyer by September. Although detailed
consent has not yet been given, it seems likely the planners will want
to see a redevelopment behind the retained facade.
The National Galleries has earmarked the site as a preferred option
for its National Gallery of Scottish Art and Design and hopes to achieve
that reality in time for the Year of Architecture and Design in 1999.
The district valuer considers the building worth #3m, a relatively
small investment in a gallery which will ultimately cost around #25m.
A Post Office spokesman said there was still wild and weird
speculation over future uses of the George Square building. ''We have
had a lot of interest but are still waiting for the right offer,'' he
added.

A LEADING judge took a tough stand over armed street crime yesterday
as he ordered a young first offender to be detained for seven years.
David Gemmell, 19, carried out three robberies at gunpoint in Glasgow
within a week.
At the High Court in Edinburgh, Lord Ross, the Lord Justice-Clerk,
told Gemmell that the three robberies revealed a course of criminal
conduct of a very serious nature.
''Armed robbery is always a very serious offence, particularly when it
takes place in public places. I must do whatever I can to protect the
public from people who behave in the manner you did.''
Mr James Campbell, advocate-depute, told the judge that Gemmell, who
is unemployed, carried out the first robbery on May 29 this year at the
Prince and Princess of Wales Hospice in Carlton Place, Glasgow.
As hospice worker Caroline Wyllie, 43, arrived for work Gemmell, who
was with another man, grabbed her by the arm and presented a silver
handgun at her. He robbed her of her handbag containing #300, two
chequebooks, and credit cards.
Five days later, 24-year-old student Nicolas Walker was attacked as he
made his way home along Renfrew Street after working late at the Glasgow
School of Architecture.
As he passed three men, he was grabbed by the arm and Gemmell pressed
what seemed to be a long-barrelled silver handgun against his face. He
demanded that Mr Walker hand over his cash.
The student was robbed of two credit cards, some personal papers, and
#7.
The following day, 25-year-old Lesley Hatfield was walking along
Carlton Place with her shopping when she saw three men ahead of her in
the street. Gemmell produced a revolver and one of the other men warned:
''You had better give him your bag. He is going to shoot you.''
The robbers ran off after taking the victim's handbag, which contained
#46.
Detectives were questioning Gemmell about the first offence when he
made a full confession to the other two robberies.
Mr Campbell said it appeared that the weapon used was an air pistol,
which looked like a replica gun.
Mr Graham Robertson, defence counsel, told the court that Gemmell had
fallen into bad company when he went to live in a hostel in Glasgow
after a row at his family home.
He had no criminal record and the offences were ''utterly out of
character''.

LABOUR'S Scottish housing spokesman John McAllion yesterday officially
opened the 50th house completed by the Lochfield Park Housing
Co-operative which is helping to transform part of the Easterhouse
housing scheme in Glasgow.
The #4m development is one by a number of community-based associations
which are refurbishing run-down former council housing to a level once
undreamt of in the peripheral housing estates.
Houses considered too far gone for redemption are being demolished to
make way for new homes.
By May, Lochfield Park will have built 86 homes on the site of former
hard-to-let housing. Most will be for rent, with another 12 for shared
ownership, which can allow people to get on the owner-occupation ladder.
There is all ready a waiting list for the unbuilt houses.

ORKNEY and Shetland councils yesterday demanded the immediate
reinstatement of freight subsidies to their islands and called for an
urgent meeting with Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth.
The moves followed yesterday's Herald report that the Government's
consultants had not recommended the withdrawal of the subsidies, in a
report which the Government is determined not to publish.
Mr Forsyth, now on three-weeks' leave, last night agreed to meet the
Orkney council and Orkney and Shetland MP Jim Wallace to discuss
subsidies for ferry services. Shetland, which has yet to table a request
formally, is also expected to attend.
Meanwhile, the Government came under increasing pressure to publish
the report by accountants KPMG, which cost the public purse #137,500 and
which argued against any move to privatise Caledonian MacBrayne. It is
understood that the report also concluded that Orkney and Shetland would
benefit from a CalMac style operation.
The convener of Orkney Council, Mr Hugh Halcro-Johnston, said: ''It is
important that we meet Mr Forsyth as soon as possible to get
clarification of this matter, and we will be calling again for the
publication of the report, along with the immediate reinstatement of
freight subsidies.''
SNP leader Alex Salmond said: ''Ian Lang commissioned the confidential
KPMG report as Scottish Secretary, using public money. If his successor,
Michael Forsyth, is as committed as he says he is to openness and
consultation, then I expect him to make the whole contents of this
report public.''
Last night, however, the Scottish Office said that the Government
still would not publish the report, even in summary form, because of
commercial confidentiality.

A PURGE against motorists and shopkeepers who obstruct pavements is to
be mounted by Strathclyde region.
Roads vice-chairman Councillor Walter MacLellan claimed that cars,
sandwich boards, and refuse sacks are a hazard to pedestrians,
particularly children and the disabled, and he warned that the roads
department would continue to take action against persistent offenders.
A leaflet, Keep Footways Safe, is to be published with the aim of
educating the public about the dangers of obstructing footpaths.
But Councillor Charles Gordon, chairman of roads and transportation,
feared the council was losing this particular battle and called for
''hundreds of prosecutions'' to halt the trend.
Conservative group leader Councillor Iain Drysdale raised a few
eyebrows at yesterday's road safety sub-committee when he claimed he had
seen police cars parked on footpaths. He promised that in future he
would take a note of the numbers and report them to the chief constable.

THE UK is welcoming record numbers of overseas tourists -- but Britons
heading abroad are facing tougher times, it was revealed yesterday.
A big influx of Americans helped foreign tourist numbers to soar by
11% in the first five months of 1995 and now a record year is expected,
both in terms of numbers and visitor spending.
But Britons travelling across the Channel were yesterday having to
contend with a 2% rise in the French VAT rate. With the pound plunging
against the franc, France is becoming an expensive place to visit.
Figures from the Central Statistical Office showed that 8.15 million
overseas tourists visited the UK in the first five months of 1995 and
spent #3770m -- 17% more than in January-May, 1994.
American numbers for the period rose 11% with many of them heading for
Manchester, where tourist chiefs announced the city was having its best
summer for tourism for years.
The number of Japanese, French, Germans, and Dutch visiting the UK was
also encouragingly high, the figures showed. Now 1995 is set to surpass
last year's record influx of 21 million visitors.
National Heritage Secretary Virginia Bottomley welcomed the figures,
saying they were very encouraging and showed Britain was an increasingly
attractive place to visit.
But while the French enjoy trips to the UK, Britons going the other
way are on the decline thanks to the fall in sterling's value against
the franc.
A little over two years ago, UK visitors to France could get more than
10 francs to the pound. Today the rate is down to around 7.4.
''The days of France being a cheap destination have probably gone for
ever,'' said Mr John Bethell of holiday company CV Travel.
It is not all doom and gloom for Britons heading abroad, though.
Travel agents report there are still plenty of last-minute bargains,
even though the peak holiday period has begun.
And the swings and roundabouts of foreign currency fluctuations mean
that while France is proving pricey, Turkey and Italy in particular are
good value for money.
A spokeswoman for the Scottish Tourist Board said no official Scottish
figures were yet available but added: ''Early indications suggest there
is cause for optimism.''
She said a marketing campaign targeting home visitors from the rest of
the UK was expected to have increased the number of domestic visitors
heading north, while the spectacular scenery in big-budget Hollywood
movies such as Rob Roy, filmed in Scotland, were expected to have
attracted foreign tourists.

SCOTTISH Secretary Michael Forsyth yesterday bowed to pressure from
his own advisers and delayed the implementation of the Government's
shake-up of secondary school examinations.
Mr Forsyth admitted that the August, 1997, deadline for introducing an
array of new courses for fifth and sixth-year pupils -- to be called
Higher Still -- cannot be met.
He has extended the timetable by one year. The first Higher Still
courses will come on stream in 1998/99 with Advanced Higher courses
being completed the following year.
The probability of a delay in implementation was first revealed in The
Herald last month.
Mr Forsyth's decision was generally welcomed, but the Educational
Institute of Scotland warned that without proper financing the reforms
would not be accepted -- even a year later.
If the Scottish Office had pressed on with the original time-scale the
reform would have been boycotted by the teachers' unions, which fear new
courses will increase workload.
In a statement issued yesterday Mr Forsyth said the reaction of
teaching professionals was a factor in his decision. ''I am aware of
widespread concerns among head teachers and others that the ultimate
quality of the arrangements may be prejudiced by the tightness of the
timescale for implementation,'' he said yesterday.
''The Higher Still Development Programme Strategy Group has advised me
that there would be merit in allowing more time for the development
phase and leeway for schools and colleges in preparing for
implementation.
''While speed is of the essence, we must not take the risk of
prejudicing the development of any of our students.''
The extra time granted before the implementation of Higher Still will
allow further consultation on key documents and issues and permit
schools and colleges to undertake preparation and staff development,
added Mr Forsyth.
Ministers and Scottish Office Education Department officials had
previously maintained that the timetable was manageable because the
reform builds on the existing course framework.
But, contrary to expectations, many new courses will have to be
developed if Higher Still is to be fully implemented.
Mr Fred Forrester, deputy general secretary of the EIS, said:
''Clearly we welcome this delay. It will allow more time for
consultation on the details of the programme.
''Very few details are known at this stage. We have the broad
framework but we don't have the proposals for individual subjects.''
Mr Forrester, however, warned that appropriate funding would have to
be put in place before teachers would accept the reforms.
''Scottish teachers have said qute clearly that all curricular
innovations are dependent on funding being made available up front. You
cannot reform Scottish education in a radical way without extra
funding.''
The decision to extend the timetable was also welcomed by Councillor
Elizabeth Maginnis, convener of Cosla's education committee. She said
the local government organisation had always supported the initiative
but had stressed concerns over the workload and resource implications at
a meeting with Lord James Douglas-Hamilton in May.
''We had cautioned that the Higher Still programme would be put in
jeopardy by a programme that was too tight and I am delighted that the
Secretary of State has heeded Cosla's advice.''
Mr Malcolm Bruce, education spokesman for the Scottish Liberal
Democrats, said the announcement did not address the issue of resources.
''The original timetable was unrealistic and over-ambitious and put
enormous pressure on already overstretched teachers. The decision to
extend the timetable is welcome and sensible, but it does not address
the question of extra resources that may be needed for curriculum
development and staff training.''
Higher Still intends that young people should be offered a ''menu'' of
about 200 courses, broken into 2000 units, or short courses.

THE new City of Edinburgh Council has launched the biggest
consultation exercise ever held in the capital by sending out 15,000
leaflets to local organisations giving information about itself.
City businessess, community groups, and other organisations are being
asked to tell the fledgling council their views on its future policies,
priorities, and structure.
A message from the Labour convener of the new council, Mr Eric
Milligan, in each leaflet, says democracy is all about participation. It
added: ''We believe that you should have the opportunity to become
involved in the reorganisation process and to influence the development
of your new council.''
The council also promises to work in partnership with local
communities and other agencies.
In the autumn, the next stage of the massive consultation exercise
will involve public meetings and an opinion survey. Discussions will
also be held with school boards, community councils, and other local
forums.

POLICE in Strathclyde issued a safety warning last night after a
10-year-old boy became the region's second drowning victim within 24
hours.
The youngster was swimming with a friend in the Lugton Water, near
Kilwinning, when he got into difficulties and was unable to reach the
riverbank. Police were trying to contact all relatives early today
before releasing his identity.
His friend was taken to Crosshouse Hospital, Kilmarnock, but was not
thought to have been seriously hurt. A report on the incident will be
sent to the procurator-fiscal.
Earlier, police divers searching for Caroline Clelland, 19, of
Whitacres Road, South Nitshill, Glasgow, found a body in Harelaw Dam,
near Neilston, Renfrewshire. She was reported missing while swimming in
the dam with friends on Tuesday night.
A Strathclyde Police spokesman said: ''With yet another young life
lost, it is important that the public should be fully aware of the
dangers of swimming in rivers, canals, reservoirs, and other waterways.
''They all look inviting during the present warm weather, but often
they have many hidden dangers such as weeds and undercurrents which are
not always obvious from the shore.''
Scores of swimmers across the UK have drowned in recent months,
especially during the school holidays, in heatwave conditions.

SCOTTISH Secretary Michael Forsyth took his political filleting knife
yesterday to Shadow Foreign Secretary Robin Cook's UK tour which he
described as the ''highlight of Labour's silly season''.
Mr Cook launched his tour in London on Tuesday to promote A People's
Europe. He said it was time for Britain to take a constructive approach
to the EU and attacked the Tories' negative attitude.
As Mr Cook arrived in Glasgow last night -- one of 10 cities he will
visit in Scotland, England, and Wales -- Mr Forsyth said it was
embarrassing to watch Mr Cook, the great anti-European, being forced to
spend his summer holidays touring the regions proclaiming Labour as the
party of Europe.
However, Mr Cook had his own knives sharpened for Mr Forsyth. His
criticism of Labour policy on Europe was utter rubbish, he told a
Scottish Labour Members Forum in Glasgow.
''This is often called the silly season and Michael Forsyth is sillier
than most,'' he said.
Mr Forsyth said, however, that Mr Cook had more to be embarrassed
about than his own U-turn. Labour's policy on Europe would be
devastating for the Scottish economy and jobs.
''The introduction of the Social Charter would savage the inward
investment which Mr Cook claims to value and would destroy jobs in
Scotland.
''Thanks to Conservative policies, deregulating and liberalising the
economy, last year was a record one for inward investment in Scotland
with 97 projects involving planned investment of more than #1100m and
the creation or safeguarding of more than 12,300 jobs.''
Mr Forsyth said Labour's policy of abandoning Britain's veto in Europe
would sell out our sovereignty while its plans for a Scottish Parliament
were being more and more emasculated everyday.
Taking away our right to say no to Brussels was hardly a recipe for
giving Scottish people more say over their own affairs, he said.
He added: ''Tony Blair has retreated from the devolutionary
commitments of the Claim of Right, signed by every Scottish Labour MP.
Mr Blair is in retreat on allocation of funds by Westminster to a
Scottish Parliament. He is wobbling over the tartan tax in the face of
its growing unpopularity.
''Mr Blair clearly realises that entrenchment of powers of an
Edinburgh Parliament would equal independence and could not be
implemented within the UK constitution. Yet still George Robertson
struggles on, beating the drums for the tartan tax and a devolutionary
policy which has been torpedoed by his leader.''
Mr Cook, however, hit back, saying: ''The Scottish Parliament will be
a strong democratic body with the power to act at home and abroad in
Scotland's interests. Our intention is rock solid. We are currently
working through the Scottish Constitutional Convention to update the
1990 proposals and I am confident that we shall reach agreement on all
outstanding matters.''

A DOG which ensured that Mrs Thatcher's bedroom was free from any
terrorist threat retired yesterday.
Dykes, a specialist explosives search dog, sniffed the former Prime
Minister's accommodation during her visits to Scotland for Conservative
Party conferences.
The eight-year-old labrador retriever has also carried out sniff
searches for John Major and Princess Anne.
His handler, Sergeant Ron Fyffe of Tayside police, said: ''When Mrs
Thatcher was the number one target in the world, Dykes searched for
explosives at all the Scottish Tory party conferences in Perth.''
The dog joined Tayside police in 1987 at seven-months-old. In his
eight-year career he has carried out 212 sniff searches for politicians,
royalty and even military bands.
But Dykes has not always had the praise he deserves. Sergeant Fyffe
revealed: ''John Major always thanks us for doing the searches but Mrs
Thatcher was always very busy. She just waved from the side of the
car.''

THERE appears to be a major difference of opinion between Scotland's
Chief Inspector of Constabulary John Boyd and his former force,
Strathclyde, over Justice Charter targets for foot patrolling.
In an interim inspection report, Mr Boyd says that Strathclyde has not
set targets for foot patrolling hours in each local division as he
recommended, and he urges Chief Constable Leslie Sharp's force ''to
reconsider its position to provide the public with more information
regarding the police performance they can expect''.
But Mr Sharp has replied that it is only in the last year that he has
succeeded in getting Strathclyde up to its authorised establishment for
the first time since its creation in 1975, and that targets would be
unrealistic. The stark fact is that Mr Sharp's persistence has brought
the force up to 6954 officers by recruiting 440 personnel in the last
year -- but that was the establishment authorised in 1975 to meet the
workload 20 years ago.
Mr Sharp is waiting on the Scottish Secretary to authorise the
recruitment of a further 250 operational officers, the cost of which, he
has said, he will meet by slashing the existing overtime budget. That
would allow him to meet today's workloads and then he would be in a
position to meet Justice Charter targets.
Mr Boyd also reiterates the necessity of setting measurable
objectives, including the setting of target response times, and goes on
to quote the Justice Charter guidelines.
Mr Sharp's reply is that there has been little or no public pressure
on this issue, and that to set up full monitoring of response times
would create a ''bureaucratic nightmare'' for no real benefit.
The difference of opinion is further evident in Mr Sharp's response to
the inspectorate over a criticism in the interim report that more has
not been done by Strathclyde police to provide video camera surveillance
of people in custody in police cells. This, Mr Boyd has pointed out,
provides protection for both sides and he was therefore disappointed to
learn that the force had not given this a higher priority as he had
recommended in his 1993 primary inspection.
A spokesman said yesterday that Mr Sharp was spending the available
money on other types of cameras -- technology which would directly
combat crime.

THE parents of seven-year-old Sophie Hook, who was found strangled on
a beach, spoke yesterday of how her murder had ''utterly ripped apart''
their close-knit family.
Sophie's mother, Julie, her voice breaking with anguish, said her
eldest daughter Jemma, nine, also wanted to die, such was her distress.
Sophie's naked body was found on a beach half a mile from the garden
of the house where she had been camping with Jemma and two cousins
overnight on Saturday at the North Wales resort of Llandudno. She had
been sexually assaulted and strangled.
As police questioned a local man for a fourth day about the murder,
Mrs Hook, 34, told an emotionally-charged news conference of the last
time she saw Sophie alive and the harrowing pain and guilt the family
was suffering.
With her husband, Christopher, 37, at her side, she said: ''Jemma is
coping extremely badly. She is totally and utterly distraught and it is
very difficult to comfort her. She is so utterly sad and angry.''
Mrs Hook added: ''Jemma said 'I want to be in heaven to be with
Sophie' -- that's very difficult for us. We are just hugging and kissing
her, holding her.''
With distress etched on her face in her second apperance before the TV
cameras since the murder, she said: ''We are such a close family -- we
have been totally and utterly ripped apart.
''We know it is something we will never get over, we will never allow
ourselves to forget Sophie.''
Mrs Hook said she and her husband and their relatives, Fiona and Danny
Jones, in whose garden the children had been camping, felt terrible
guilt about Sophie's death.
Mrs Hook condemned the killer as the most ''evil and horrendous
monster in the world''.
She said: ''I just feel numb, totally and utterly numb. I think most
people believe in good -- it is very difficult to comprehend that
somebody could be so evil.
''It is hard to feel anything towards him being the murderer -- I feel
that until we get whoever did this terrible crime it is impossible to
feel anything.''
The Hook family had travelled up from their home at Budworth in
Cheshire to visit Mrs Hook's sister, Mrs Jones, and her family at their
house in Llandudno when Sophie was murdered.
Setting out from Cheshire had been a happy, normal occasion with the
children eagerly looking forward to a barbecue to celebrate their
cousin, Luke's, ninth birthday, Mrs Hook said.
''It was an exciting morning in our household. The children were keen
to give Luke the presents they had bought him.''
Mrs Hook told how she kissed Sophie goodbye when they left her to camp
in the garden overnight with the others in the tent given to Luke for
his birthday.
''I kissed them goodbye. 'Have a good time, I'll see you tomorrow',''
she said she had told them.
''When Sophie needed us the most we were not there for her -- that is
so difficult to deal with.''
At the news conference, at North Wales police headquarters at Colwyn
Bay, near Llandudno, Mrs Hook said all her children -- including Joseph,
five, and Ellie, 21 months -- had been particularly close.
''They played beautifully together and did not argue. We are
encouraging Jemma to talk about Sophie and what we have done together in
the summer holidays.
''The worst of it all is that the only thing I want in my life now is
Sophie. People can take anything from me but no one had the right to
take our child.
''Why any child, why Sophie?''
Mrs Hook said she and her husband had videos and photos of Sophie from
when she was a baby until two weeks ago at her school's sports day.
''Whatever we do in the future, over the years, we will always keep
Sophie part of the family.''
Mrs Hook said there had been an incredible response from friends and
family sending cards and flowers. It was painful for her and her husband
to read the cards, but it showed that people really did care.
Speaking of the guilt felt by the the parents of both families, she
said: ''I protected our children so much I never even allowed them to
cross the road on their own.''
Mr Jones felt guilty that he did not sleep with the children in the
tent, Mrs Hook added.
She said the families often holidayed together. The children -- the
Joneses have four young boys -- played together frequently and were very
close.
Mr Hook, managing director of a marketing firm, said that since the
murder: ''We are just hugging each other and crying. We talk about the
good times we've spent together.''
The couple repeated their appeal for the public to help bring the
killer to justice and said anyone shielding him should come forward.
Mr Hook added that anger kept building up inside their whole family.
Earlier, police said they were trying to establish the exact location
where Sophie might have met her death.
Detective Superintendent Eric Jones, in charge of the investigation,
suggested there could be a third scene, in addition to the garden where
she had been camping and the beach where her body was found.
He said it was possible the sexual assault took place there, after
Sophie wandered away from, or was lured or snatched from, the garden and
before her body was left on the beach.
He issued an even more urgent appeal to the public for help in finding
Sophie's Pooh Bear nightdress and cream socks, which he said were
crucial to the inquiry.
Police investigating the murder spent most of yesterday at the home of
the 28-year-old suspect being questioned at Llandudno police station.
About 12 forensic experts, including some in white overalls, were at
the #150,000 detached house above Colwyn Bay, meticulously searching the
two-storey building, the garage, a back garden shed and both the front
and back gardens.
Uniformed officers kept guard over the house while the search
continued into the evening.

AN inquiry was launched last night after Nottinghamshire Constabulary
admitted it had lost five guns.
Police officers had to ask for assistance from the public to help them
find the weapons.
The five Smith and Wesson handguns in a black hold-all are thought to
have fallen out of a Ford Transit van taking officers to Nottinghamshire
headquarters following a training session.
''The side door had been left open because of the hot weather,'' a
police spokesman said.
The force said it was taking the loss very seriously and had called in
the Police Complaints Authority to conduct an investigation.
The officers realised the revolvers were missing about one mile away
from the police station.
A police spokesman said: ''It is presumed that they may have fallen
out of the side door of the Transit which had been open because of the
heat.''

DETECTIVES are investigating the suspected mercy killing of a baby
girl at a leading children's hospital.
Abigail Watts, aged 14 months, died at the Royal Manchester Children's
Hospital, Pendlebury, on Tuesday.
It is understood that she had been seriously ill from birth and was
brain damaged.
Detective Superintendent Bill Kerr, the head of Salford CID, said:
''We have been asked by coroner Martin Coppell to investigate the
circumstances of the death of a 14-month-old girl at the hospital.''
The child's parents, who live in the Greater Manchester area, have
both been interviewed by police. However, it could be several days
before a decision is made on whether to bring charges.
The case is believed to mirror that of brain-damaged Thomas Creedon,
aged two.
His parents, Con and Fiona, from Hull, launched a landmark legal
battle last month for permission to allow him to die.
Thomas cannot hear or speak, has no control over his limbs or head,
and suffers fits.
Last week a High Court judge ruled that he should be made a ward of
court.
Detectives in Salford believe that publicity about Thomas' case could
be a key factor in the death of the baby girl.
In another case, the parents of a two-year-old boy who was left
brain-damaged after a heart operation in Devon also started a campaign
last month for the right to end his life by lethal injection.
A Greater Manchester Police spokesman said Manchester coroner Martin
Coppel had asked them to investigate the circumstances surrounding
Abigails's death.

FORENSIC scientists were last night examining a knife believed to have
been used in the killing of two schoolboys stabbed to death on a fishing
trip.
The discovery came as a 36-year-old man appeared in court charged with
the murders.
Robbie Gee, 12, and his best friend, Paul Barker, 13, were found with
multiple stab wounds after they disappeared on their fishing trip to
ponds near their homes on Saturday.
There were rowdy scenes yesterday as factory worker Mr Stephen Heaney
appeared before magistrates at Birkenhead, Merseyside.
He stood with head bowed, handcuffed to a police officer, in the
enclosed dock during the four-minute hearing amid strict security.
Reporting restrictions were not lifted.
Mr Heaney, of Sutherland Drive, Eastham, had arrived at 8.30am hidden
under a blanket in a police van. A woman carried a hand-written placard
proclaiming ''Bring Back Hanging''.
Conservationist Ms Elizabeth Bamber, 37, a member of Amnesty
International, said she had been a life-long abolitionist until she
changed her mind 12 months ago. ''There is no deterrent,'' she said.
During the hearing, Mr Heaney said nothing except to confirm his
personal details. He was accompanied by four police officers.
He stood silently and showed no emotion when the court clerk read the
two murder charges to him. He was remanded in custody to appear in court
again on August 16.
As he was driven away, there were screams of abuse from a crowd of
about 40 people behind the court building in Mortimer Street. At least
two stones were thrown at the van but there was no damage and the crowd
quickly dispersed.
Later police disclosed that a knife had been found at Spital train
station not far from the murder scene.
''We are connecting this weapon with the murders. It has been
submitted for forensic examination,'' said a police spokesman.
Meanwhile, the huge police search around the murder scene has ended
and the area reopened to the public.
Wirral coroner Mr Christopher Johnson will open an inquest into the
boys' deaths today at Wallasey Town Hall. He would hear evidence of
identification before adjourning the hearing, said a spokeswoman.

BBC1 Controller Alan Yentob, under fire for being too commercial in
his approach, yesterday announced details of a #168m autumn schedule
with a strong emphasis on programmes designed to capture an even greater
share of the mass audience.
Among the highlights of the 520 hours of new shows unveiled in London
yesterday is a return to the BBC for Rowan Atkinson in a new police
sitcom written by Ben Elton, The Thin Blue Line; The Final Cut, the
concluding part of Michael Dobbs' Westminster trilogy; and an ambitious
26-part documentary series, People's Century, which chronicles the
turbulent events of the last 95 years.
The autumn line-up is particularly strong on comedy. In addition to
Atkinson, BBC1 will also feature the return of Mel Smith and Griff
Rhys-Jones; a revival of Maureen Lipman's LWT agony aunt character, Jane
Lucas, in Agony Again; and comedian Frank Skinner in his first solo
series, The Frank Skinner Show.
High quality period drama comes in the shape of Andrew Davies'
adaptation of Jane Austen's Pride And Prejudice, for Sunday nights.
Mr Yentob has been criticised recently, mainly by disillusioned
television dramatists, for playing too safe with the schedules. Last
month his arch rival Marcus Plantin, network director of ITV, accused
him of running the station ''in an increasingly commercial manner''.
Yesterday Mr Yentob, defending his record, said: ''We have narrowed
the gap (between BBC1 and ITV) by three points in the course of this
year which is very substantial. BBC1 is about the range of programmes.
It is not a channel which can be compared with ITV.
The autumn will see the return of tried-and-tested populist favourites
including Keeping Up Appearances, Last Of The Summer Wine, Challenge
Anneka, The Generation Game (with new host, Jim Davidson), Telly
Addicts, 2Point4 Children, Casualty, Roughnecks, and Dangerfield.
Among the raft of new dramas are Backup, a police series centred on
the activities of an inner-city uniformed support unit; Rich Deceiver,
starring Lesley Dunlop as a housewife who tries to keep her #1.5m pools
win a secret from her husband; Soul Survivors, a two-part comedy drama
about the search for a 60s soul group.
Feature films premiered include My Cousin Vinny, Leap Of Faith, Soft
Top, Hard Shoulder and Medicine Man.
Meanwhile, John Birt, the BBC's controversial director general, is to
receive an Emmy, one of the highest awards in the world of television.
Mr Birt, 50, will collect his directorate award for his ''outstanding
contribution'' to international television in New York next month.

<HEADLINE>As broadcast on breast screening is condemned, fewer are dying from cervical cancer. Professor's X-ray claims 'unsound'</HEADLINE>

UP to 22 women in Britain could be dying every year from breast cancer
brought about by medical X-ray procedures, the National Radiological
Protection Board said yesterday.
The board was rebutting claims by an American professor that up to 90%
of breast cancer was caused by X-rays.
Professor John Gofman, of the University of California, said tens of
millions of lives had been lost as a result, and that other studies, as
yet unfinished, would show a similar situation with other cancers.
The scientist made his claims at a news conference in London to
promote a controversial TV programme on the subject being screened
tonight.
The NRPB condemned plans to broadcast what it called the professor's
''alarming, unsound, and misleading'' claims on Carlton TV's The Big
Story; they said showing the programme could cause women unnecessary
anxiety and disrupt screening programmes for the early detection of
breast cancer that rely on X-ray examinations.
In the programme, and in a book he has written, Professor Gofman
alleges 75% of all female breast cancers might have been caused by
X-rays in routine medical treatments over the past 50 years. Yesterday
he said even that was an underestimate and the true figure could be 90%.
Professor Gofman bases his claims on radiation dosages gathered after
the atom bomb attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. He claims to have
discovered a direct link between X-rays in early life and the onset of
breast cancers decades later. He told the programme: ''What we learned
from the gamma rays at Hiroshima are directly applicable to medical
X-rays in all parts of the Western world.''
Dr Chris Sharp, head of the NRPB's medical department, said Professor
Gofman's work was ''seriously flawed.''
He added: ''It's unsound, inaccurate, misleading, and, more than
anything else, it's unnecessarily alarmist.
''Radiation can induce a cancer, and the more radiation you have the
more likely you are to have a cancer. It can appear many years after the
exposure. That is all taken into account when we work out the risk.
''The risk as calculated by him is 30 times higher than by any
international or national organisation.
''The risk when a woman has a mammogram screening of it inducing a
cancer is one in 100,000. But they are picking up thousands of cancers a
year. He is holding out the prospect to women that if they never have an
X-ray in their life, they will not get breast cancer, and that's
absolutely not true. Breast cancer did not start when X-rays began to be
used.''
Current radiation doses to patients in America are significantly
higher than those in the UK. If Professor Gofman's estimate was right,
the NRPB points out, far more women who were exposed to high medical
doses in the US would have developed breast cancer than actually have.
Meanwhile, fewer Scots women are dying from cervical cancer, a trend
which experts last night attributed to increasing success of screening
programmes. Deaths from the disease fell to 154 last year, the lowest on
record, and about 40% lower than a decade ago.
Cervical screening, introduced in Scotland 30 years ago, was radically
overhauled following a critical report in 1988 which advocated routine
three-yearly testing and rigorous follow-up.
Professor Frederick Walker, of Aberdeen University's department of
pathology, said: ''We are now seeing a consistent downward trend and
what is keeping it down is the screening programme.''
Ms Penny Richardson, who led the Cervical Screening Campaign, said:
''It is pleasing that all the hard work women put into the campaign now
seems to be having an impact. A lot of changes were made for the better
but this underlines the message that women should make sure they have
regular smear checks.''
Lessons from the cervical screening were incorporated into
breast-screening programme introduced in 1991, which so far has had
little impact on mortality. A total of 1275 women in Scotland died from
the disease last year, compared to 1280 in 1993. The target is to reduce
mortality by 25% by the year 2000.
The 1994 figures also reveal a rise in the biggest cancer killer among
Scottish women. Lung cancer killed 1592 of them, 300 more than a decade
ago.

MODEL Liz Hurley has disclosed that she ''felt like she'd been shot''
when she learned that her film actor boyfriend Hugh Grant had been
arrested with a prostitute.
She told him she did not want to marry at the moment, which ''didn't
go down too well'', she said.
The Estee Lauder model and actress spoke about the affair for the
first time on an American news show.
In the parts of the interview for American television released last
night, she said she learned about his arrest with prostitute Divine
Brown seconds before speaking to Grant himself.
Grant's arrest at Sunset Boulevard one month ago continues to have
reverberations for his acting career. Last night, he did not attend the
British premiere of his new film at the Odeon in Leicester Square,
London.
Publicists for The Englishman Who Went Up A Hill And Came Down A
Mountain hoped until the last minute that he would turn up but he flew
out to New York on Tuesday night to work on a thriller.
Grant last night explained his decision not to attend the British
premiere of his new film, saying he did not want it to receive the
''wrong kind of publicity''.
He also claimed his life had been ''pretty grim'' since his arrest.
In a newspaper interview, he said: ''There's a genuine dilemma.
''If I had gone to the premiere, I might well have totally wrecked the
proceedings for reasons you might guess.
''And that's the last thing I wanted to do because I really enjoyed
making it and I think it has come out very well.''
He added: ''It certainly doesn't deserve the wrong kind of publicity
and I'm afraid at the moment I might have given it that.''
In the exclusive interview with Barbara Walters, Hurley spoke frankly
of her continuing devastation at Grant's arrest. She heard he had been
arrested ''seconds before'' speaking to him on the telephone, she said.
Ms Walters asked her: ''What did you say? What did he say?''
Miss Hurley said: ''Well, I think I felt like I had been shot. I ran
out. I think I was, I think I am in shock.''
She said she was ''miserable as sin'' accompanying Grant to the US
opening of his most recent film Nine Months. But she added: ''I don't
think you should hit someone when they're down.''
Their relationship was one where ''you're very at home with each
other'', she told Ms Walters. Asked if it was a romance, she said: ''I
think yes, definitely.''
Nevertheless, they had never been further from marriage, she said.
''There's never been a time in my life where where I've felt less
inclined to get married, so that doesn't go down too well.''
Last night, the chairman of Miramax Films said Grant had telephoned
him to apologise for his absence from the premiere and make a donation
to Children With Leukaemia.
The film stars Grant in typical mild-mannered form as a cartographer
who upsets a Welsh village by trying to de-recognise their mountain.
They hold him captive until they can increase the height of the mountain
themselves.

A WORKERS' campaign against the privatisation of Scottish Nuclear has
been crushed after employees were told to stop criticising the
Government's sell-off plans or risk losing their jobs.
Workers at Scottish Nuclear's East Kilbride headquarters and its
Torness power station also claim the recent ousting of Mr James Hann as
company chairman removed their strongest ally in the fight against the
proposed merger with English-based Nuclear Electric.
A senior management official at the company confirmed that Government
interference had led to the effective gagging of any opposition to the
privatisation deal.
Three months ago, dozens of Scottish Nuclear employees led a
high-profile campaign against Government plans to merge their company
with Nuclear Electric prior to privatisation in 1996.
The campaign was supported by nine trade unions, including the
powerful AEEU, IPMS, and TGWU, and all three opposition political
parties.
Workers said the proposed sale of Scottish Nuclear had one purpose,
''to provide funds for a desperate piece of pre-election tax cutting'',
and promised to continue the fight for an independent and publicly-owned
Scottish company.
However, campaigners told The Herald yesterday they had been told to
''shut up'' by their Government bosses or risk losing their jobs.
A Torness based activist said: ''The campaign no longer exists as far
as the workers are concerned. Any comments now have to come from trade
union officials outwith the company.
''We have been told that, because we are employed by a company in a
run-up to a proposed privatisation with share values at stake, we can't
speak and if we do our jobs are at risk.''
Another former campaign leader at the East Kilbride headquarters
added: ''Pressure has been put on the company. We have had to knuckle
down and pass the campaign on to full-time union officials. Our own
hands have been securely tied. James Hann got a lot of backing from
ourselves but once they got rid of him we realised it was every man for
himself.''
A senior management spokesman at Scottish Nuclear last night supported
the workers' claims, telling The Herald the threat to jobs ''was no
great secret''.
He added: ''The pressure from the Government is very noticeable on
what can and can't be said. That pressure has increased since May 9 when
the privatisation arrangements were announced.''
Ms Ann Douglas, the secretary of EMA -- a leading supporter of the
Scottish Nuclear Workers Campaign -- said she was aware that at the time
of the privatisation announcement workers were warned not to speak to
the press ''in case it jeopardised the privatisation process''.
She said the campaign had been handed to the trade unions at that
point for reasons of tactics and long-term strategy.
She was not aware of any specific threat to jobs but her union would
investigate the claims and take up the issue with the company and
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth.
Mr Malcolm Bruce, the Liberal Democrats industry spokesman, said the
Scottish Nuclear workers had been stripped of their democratic rights of
free speech.
''These are bully boy tactics from a Government that will stop at
nothing to get their hands on cash for tax cuts,'' he said. ''I will be
personally asking Ian Lang to justify these totally cynical and ruthless
tactics.''
Labour's industry spokesman Mr Brian Wilson said he was angry at the
''monstrous interference in worker's civil liberties'' and would be
calling on the President of the Board of Trade and the Scottish
Secretary to renounce the gagging order.
''The people who work in an industry are entitled to take a view on
its future ownership and to seek to influence that process,'' he added.
Ms Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish National Party's energy spokeswoman
said the attempts by the Government to gag dissent was an outrage.
''This is further evidence of a complete stitch-up and confirms what I
had already heard. The people of Scotland have a right to know what is
going on,'' she added.
Last night, a Scottish Nuclear spokesman said he could make no comment
on the claims of the workers or the management source. A spokesmen at
the Scottish Office and Department of Trade and Industry denied
''categorically'' the claims.
The Scottish Office spokesman said: ''It is nonsense to suggest that
the Scottish Office has interferred in the management of staff at
Scottish Nuclear. No contact has been made between the Scottish Office
and any group of Scottish Nuclear staff on this kind of issue.''
Meanwhile, both the Government and Scottish Nuclear denied reports in
a national newspaper that a secret deal had been orchestrated to give a
second top position in the new nuclear power holding company to Dr
Robert Hawley, the current chief executive of Nuclear Electric.
Spokesmen said the claims that Dr Hawley had been guaranteed the board
position were blatantly untrue.
But politicians were more sceptical. Mr Bruce said, if true, the
manoeuvres were a betrayal of promises made to the workers and
management.

UNITED Nations officials said yesterdaythat the Croatian government
and rebel Serbs were mobilising tens of thousands of troops for possible
full-scale war.
Croat forces blasted Serb positions on the eastern approaches to the
rebel stronghold of Knin, keeping up military pressure on the Croatian
Serbs.
The shelling attacks, launched from western Bosnia, came amid signs
that the Zagreb government was poised to seize back the Krajina Serb
region by force.
''In Croatia the troop build-up continues. We now assess there are as
many as 100,000 Croatian soldiers fully mobilised and battle-ready and
as many as 50,000 on the Serb side,'' said UN spokesman Chris Gunness.
With both armies massing troops, prospects for peace looked bleak
before today's planned talks in Geneva between Croatian government and
Krajina Serb envoys.
Zagreb wants the minority Serbs to accept Croatian rule, with
guarantees of local autonomy.
The Serbs seem unlikely to accept Croatian president Franjo Tudjman's
ultimatum that within 24 hours of the talks they must reopen rail links
and oil pipelines through Krajina.
A Croatian Serb warplane flew into Bosnian airspace over the Bihac
enclave yesterday and left after being spotted and warned by a Nato
surveillance aircraft.

THE chief prosecutor of a United Nations war crimes tribunal on former

leader Dr Radovan Karadzic and his military chief, General Ratko Mladic,
on trial.
Judge Richard Goldstone said he believed the two men, who were last
week charged with genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity,
would be brought to justice.
''I don't accept for a moment that it's inevitable that they are not
going to stand trial,'' he told Channel Four television news. If Dr
Karadzic and Gen Mladic leave their country they can be arrested.
Warrants for their arrest were also sent to the authorities in Sarajevo,
Zagreb, Belgrade, and Pale.
''In the indictments we've issued, we are satisfied that the evidence
on which we rely is obtainable. I wouldn't issue an indictment on
somebody on evidence I couldn't readily obtain,'' said Judge Goldstone.
The Hague-based tribunal, created by the UN Security Council in 1993,
is the first international body for the prosecution of war crimes since
the Nuremberg and Tokyo trials after the Second World War.
The tribunal issued five indictments on July 25 charging a total of 24
Bosnian and Croatian Serbs with crimes ranging from genocide to breaches
of the Geneva Convention.
Mr Goldstone, a former South African judge who joined the tribunal in
August, also called for the establishment of a standing war crimes
court.
Dr Karadzic and Gen Mladic are accused of ordering the shelling of
civilian gatherings, including the May 1995 attack on a Tuzla square in
which 195 people were killed or wounded, and the seizure of 284 UN
peacekeepers this summer.
So far only one war crimes suspect, Bosnian Serb Dusan Tadic, is in
the custody of the tribunal. Tadic, who is accused of killing, raping,
and torturing Croats and Moslems in Bosnia's Prijedor region, was
arrested in Germany last year.

THE Industrial Pollution Inspectorate has reservations about the
wisdom of siting the Osprey wave power generator in the Pentland Firth
while a major search for radioactive contamination at the Dounreay plant
is under way.
The Osprey is a generator developed by an Inverness firm and capable
of producing power for a village of 1000 people, but its installation
will be delayed for at least a day after its departure from Clydebank
was postponed when a tug developed an electrical fault.
A spokesman for the inspectorate said yesterday that it had no
authority to prevent the installation of Osprey and was not objecting,
but its officers had raised their concerns with the authorities.
''While the investigations are ongoing into the particles and we are
trying to establish where the contamination is coming from and how
extensive it is, we just feel it is not the most sensible thing to do to
have a wave machine offshore and have engineers tying it down and
working on it.
''The inspectorate has written to Highland Regional Council saying
that it hopes they take account of these views if and when they come to
consider any planning-related issues. It has also written to the UK
Atomic Energy Authority at Dounreay in a similar vein,'' the spokesman
said.
Mr Allan Thomson, managing director of Applied Research and
Technology, the Inverness-based company which developed Osprey, said:
''This is all news to me. I am not aware of any problem at all, and have
heard nothing from HMIPI. We have been up there getting seabed samples
and doing diver surveys without any problem at Dounreay, so I don't know
what the difficulty is.''
Meanwhile, a spokesman for Dounreay confirmed yesterday that failures
in the containers used for transporting irradiated fuel between
buildings may have been the source of nearly 90 patches of contaminated
ground at the plant.
He said that a hatch bolted on the underside of the flasks, which were
in use until the mid-1970s, did not have seals, allowing fission
products, such as caesium, to leak out.
The AEA has been conducting a sweep of the plant and has so far
discovered 21 ''hot spots'' and 67 patches of less significant
contamination.
A spokesman said yesterday: ''The major thrust of this work, which
will take 10 weeks to complete, is to scan the whole external surface of
the site.''

<HEADLINE>Bank snubbed again on rate rise. Clarke's inflation gamble</HEADLINE>

THE Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr Kenneth Clarke, has defied another
warning from the Bank of England that he should raise interest rates.
He is gambling that his refusal will not force him into a bigger,
politically damaging increase later in the year.
It emerged yesterday that for their fourth meeting in a row, Bank of
England Governor Eddie George asked the Chancellor to sanction a rise of
a quarter to half a per cent to dampen inflationary pressures the Bank
sees in the economy.
Despite his warning that failure to put up the current 6.75% rate
could see inflation spiral well above the Government's target figure of
2.5% later in the year, Mr Clarke continued to back his hunch that the
economy would be hurt rather than helped if he agreed.
Yesterday in the City, the FT-SE 100 index was within sight of a
record high after rosing 50 points in the day closing at just below
3500.
Mr Clarke seems to be concerned about the impact on the already
depressed housing market of a rise, as well as on manufacturing
industry, where investment is sluggish.
Mr John Prescott, Labour's deputy leader, said: ''The Chancellor is
increasingly isolated with the Bank of England confirming the OECD
analysis that the Government will miss its inflation target unless
interest rates are increased.
He said the Bank's analysis showed lack of investment and capacity in
the economy and ''highlighted the same old problems that have bedevilled
the British economy for the past 16 years and are once more threatening
the recovery at an early stage''.
Mr Alan Milburn, the Labour Treasury spokesman, said: ''It's
complacency of the worst sort with the Government sitting back and
simply hoping it will all come right.''
Mr Malcolm Bruce, the Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, accused the
Government of putting its desire to win the next election above the
needs of the economy, by refusing to raise interest rates and planning
tax cuts.
The Bank is worried that inflationary pressures, including above
inflation rate wage increases and claims, are threatening the future of
the economy. Mr Clarke is thought to take the view that an interest rate
rise could fuel higher wage demands.
His stand has been boosted by good economic results. The trade gap has
narrowed. Exports climbed to #12.59bn in May from #12.25bn while imports
fell from #13.55bn to #13.45bn.
In addition a report from the respected Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development, praising the Conservatives' handling of
the economy in general, has boosted Ministers' confidence.
Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine said that the combination of
high economic growth, the prospect of rising living standards, the
competitiveness of the economy, and record exports was ''the dream
target that governments have always sought and hardly ever achived''.
Mr Heseltine insisted that the long awaited ''feel good factor'' would
arrive in time to change public opinion and carry the Tories to their
fifth election win.
However, the danger for the Government is that, if it is forced into
bigger interest rate increases in the next 18 months, this could fatally
damage its election chances.
Whitehall sources said that both the Bank and the Treasury opinions
were very much taken on a balance of the argument, which implies that Mr
Clarke could indeed be forced to act, if the economic indicators turn
against him.
However, he feels that, over the four-month period since an interest
rate rise was mooted by the Bank, events have justified his refusal and
he intends to stick with it.

William Hunter ships out to Irvine for a show with a piratical edge.
WHAT'S the difference between a world cruise and a Clyde pier? You can
always get off a Clyde pier.
The summer show in Irvine of the Scottish Maritime Museum provides a
sailing ticket back to the plush lethargy of long days and short nights
on the great passenger ships. Apart from seasickness (not emphasised at
the Carry On Cruising exhibition), the main problem about life on the
luxury liners was to repel boredom.
Veronica Hartwich, curator of collections at the museum, summed up
such enviable hardship in one shipshape and Bristol-fashion sentence.
''Passengers on a ship cannot go anywhere,'' she said, ''so they have
plenty of time to fill.''
Filling also themselves was one solution. Dining menus on display read
like poems to gluttony. To some of them clings a nursery innocence. For
instance, semolina puddings seem to have been a big treat for Edwardian
seafarers. To early-Victorian travellers P &amp; O included unlimited drinks
in the cost of trips to African and the East.
Carrying on Cruising sings with the siren names of great ships --
Normandie, the America, Capetown Castle,, Viceroy of India, the Queens.
Ordinary holidaymakers never got closer to them than the photos on
cigarette cards. Shipyard workers who toiled on them did not dream they
would sail on them.
Well-off passengers expected to live on shipboard as they did at home.
When they went sailing it was not to see the sea. ''Really, they were
floating palaces,'' said Suzanne Le Blanc, the designer of the
exhibition who had the neat idea of putting in a gangway for an
entrance. Seagulls scream in the background above the gentle chuckle of
a placid ocean.
She pointed out that the games to while away the pampered ennui of a
long voyage did not change for half a century. It seems as if nobody had
the energy to think up new ways to soak up time.
Shuffleboard and pingpong remained the most serious preoccupations of
sea life. While some passengers took dancing lessons, others were
content to take tea. They smoked and chatted. Before professional
entertainers were hired - not until after the Hitler war -- amusement
was self-made. Life on the ocean wave for the gentry was about having
singsongs, doing jigsaws, and dressing up for parties. One of the most
evocatively intrusive photographs at the show displays the nether limbs
of the elegant beauties on one voyage in a neatest ankle competition.
Such diversions are a rare treat at the Scottish Maritime Museum,
usually more concerned with much less posh seagoing and boats that did
dirty work for a living.
''Suddenly, we found we had enough material to have an exhibition,''
Veronica Hartwich said, explaining that many of the salty items on show
are from private collections.
Some could have been started very privately. It is hard not to ponder
how some of the fancier objects of tableware were slipped ashore.
Presumably, the floating grand hotels of liners had a seepage of some of
their possessions much as land-based palaces have always suffered. There
is even a cabinet of fluffy towels which have survived the wrecking of
the great ships whose names they are marked with. Hints of high-sea
larceny give the Irvine show a piratical edge.
Carrying On Cruising is until October 31.
