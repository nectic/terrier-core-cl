SHARE prices soared in New York last night with the Dow Jones index
climbing into record territory on the back of the biggest one-day gain
in more than three years on aggressive buying after last week's loss of
nearly 70 points.
The blue-chip index surged 86.46 points at a record 4465.14, eclipsing
the old record of 4438.16 reached last Wednesday. It was the biggest
one-day gain since December 23, 1991, when it rose 88.10 points.
''This market has been nervous but now people want to put their money
to work,'' said Alice Hook, a McDonald &amp; Co trader.
Traders said buying was broad-based and aggressive, with scattered
programme buying helping to fuel the Dow's rise. After the Dow rose over
50 points at late afternoon, setting NYSE curbs on certain programme
trading, the Dow climbed another 36 points in the last hour of trading.
The S&amp;P 500 index and NYSE Composite indices also scored all-time
closing highs.
A recovery in the dollar after concerted central bank intervention and
more evidence that the US economy was in for a soft landing helped push
up shares prices.
The Federal Reserve, joined by other major central banks, jumped into
foreign exchange markets to buy dollars in an aggressive move to bolster
the battered US currency. The dollar was firm in US trading after
co-ordinated central bank intervention, which was estimated at some
$2000m.
In Washington, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said the buying
reflected the exchange rate objectives of the leading industrial
nations, whose finance ministers met in April in the US capital.
Although first-quarter gross domestic product growth was revised
downward to an annual rate of 2.7% compared with a 2.8% estimate last
month, inventories were lower and final sales higher than originally
expected.
In another report, sales of new homes dropped 2.7% in April despite
spring weather and cheaper mortgages, pushing the supply of finished but
unsold homes to the highest level in nearly five years.
''The GDP report helps or bolsters the soft landing thesis,'' one
analyst said.
''Consumers are retrenching due to heavy debt loads and the need to
improve balance sheets,'' said Jerry Jasinowski, president of the
National Association of Manufacturers.
Inventories did not pile up quite as much as first thought at the
beginning of 1995, Mr Jasinowski observed, ''Nevertheless, with a large
oversupply of unsold goods, there will be a selloff in the second
quarter.''
He said the revised GDP data ''confirm that the economy is slowing
down, and suggest that the second quarter also will be quite weak.''

<HEADLINE>Bid to raise levels of investment in infrastructure projects. Labour seeks private finance</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>NICOLA REEVES</BYLINE>

THE Labour Party is keen to attract private finance into a host of
infrastructure projects not just in the traditional ''physical'' areas
of roads and hospitals, but into building up the UK's communications and
social infrastructure in areas such as the provision of high-quality
childcare.
While 80% of single parents are working in the USA, the figure is just
46% in Britain.
Gordon Brown, Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer, believes there is
scope for a similar partnership approach to be applied to rebuilding
industries through partnerships between regional development agencies
and local companies.
There appears to be enormous scope for private finance in public
projects under Labour if the noises coming out of yesterday's one-day
conference in London, entitled ''Public/Private Sector Partnerships'',
are to be believed.
Among the options for partnership highlighted are capital projects
with scope for innovative design and construction techniques. It is
recognised that in such projects, clear guidelines would have to be
given to protect intellectual property rights. This problem is of
particular concern where projects have high initial capital costs
relative to subsequent running costs. This was highlighted by Chemical
Bank's recent report for Strathclyde Regional Council on build, own and
operate schemes for water treatment and sewerage projects in Scotland.
Among other potential projects highlighted were those where private
partners can be involved in both initial investment and subsequent
operation, and those which offer scope for developing new revenue
sources. Among the latter, for example, local authority buildings and
other facilities could be used for private conferences or other
functions when not occupied by their normal users. Cars from vehicle
fleets could be be hired out during periods when fluctuating demand
produces excess capacity.
Potential further sources of value include the transfer of planning
gains, offering the benefits of changes in regulations and making use of
property development rights.
One example highlighted by Labour of an innovative partnership in
urban development is the Edinburgh Financial Services Centre currently
under construction. Central and local government have joined with the
private sector in a development which is expected to provide 10,000 jobs
in financial services and contains a conference centre as its focal
point.
The Government has had its own Private Finance Initiative but this has
not been as successful as some had hoped. According to Ernst &amp; Young,
which has considerable experience in the field, one of the chief
deterrents to private sector involvement has been the Government's
''hands-off'' policy with regard to privately-financed projects. This
results in unnecessary increased risk and therefore cost to the
taxpayer, as well as delay in implementing proposed projects.
Labour believes that it is essential to achieve a proper sharing of
risk. One way in which this could be achieved would be through a public
projects investment broker, enhancing the role of the Private Finance
Panel. Labour intends to consult on any action government can take to
encourage the transfer of risks within the private sector to those
enterprises best able to bear them.
One possible route would be for government to invest in new operator
companies rather than directly in the projects themselves. These
companies might in turn insure their risks with private insurers. These
are some of a number of proposals contained in a consultation paper
produced by Labour's Treasury team.
Other proposals include giving explicit indications of priorities with
those projects deemed to be of vital national interest being given first
priority. Labour is considering ways in which government's clear
commitment to projects could be demonstrated.
One option would be for government to insure its private sector
partners against some of those risks they cannot bear themselves and
where private insurance is unavailable.
By setting out its commitment at the outset, Labour believes that the
decision-making process could be streamlined. It is examining ways in
which the Treasury could be given a more strategic role with less
involvement in individual projects.
The level of interest among potential corporate partners was
demonstrated by the long list of representatives at the conference.
These included the Glasgow Development Agency, Scottish Enterprise,
Tarmac, Ernst &amp; Young, BAA, George Wimpey, Hewden Stuart, Lothian
Regional Council, the Post Office, East Midlands Electrictity and BT.

THE Scottish Rugby Union looks poised to have a fresh sponsor when the
new National Leagues get under way next season.
I understand that an announcment is imminent, with Tennent-Caledonian
stepping in to back the new structure.
Hitherto, the company have confined themselves to sponsorhip of the
Midlands Cup, Jed-Forest sevens, and a number of grass-roots coaching
clinics, but will take over from Scottish Brewers, who have backed
Scottish rugby for the past nine seasons.
Negotiations have been going on between Scottish Brewers and the SRU
for a number of months, but discussions could not be concluded and
Scottish Brewers have decided not to exercise their option of continuing
the sponsorship deal.
Last night Scottish Brewers' managing director Collin Wood said: ''We
have parted amicably. There was nothing wrong with the sponsorship and
we have had a good relationship for nine years but we, as a company,
just felt that we wanted to do something different.''
Scottish Brewers have a long-standing relationship with a number of
Scottish clubs and Wood said: ''We want to continue our relationship
with rugby at the grass roots and we have a number of exciting
initiatives in the pipeline.''
Talks are continuing over the sponsorship of the new knock-out cup
competition which also gets under way next season, although there is a
feeling in influential quarters that until the competition is up and
running it might be better if it is funded by the SRU without the added
complication of a commercial partner at this stage.

Madrid, like a live eye in the Iberian mask, Asks help from heaven and
receives a bomb . . . George Barker
THEY played the game of moral equivalence when Spain was dismembered
too. Fault was found on all sides and Britain announced
non-intervention. As a token of its neutrality, HMG imposed an arms
embargo while Hitler sustained Franco with troops, tanks, aircraft, and
guns. None of it was our business.
The men of the British battalion of the XVth International Brigade, of
whom one-quarter died, made it their business. Most knew little of Spain
-- few people did -- and had certainly never been there. Yet barely
trained, fighting with ancient rifles, and manipulated by a cynical
Communist leadership, they became the Republic's shock troops.
Why? Why did perhaps 500 Scots, most of them ordinary working men,
surmount all official obstacles to serve in Spain, to present, as Auden
once put it, their lives? The cause was just but, more than that, it was
clear. The volunteers cut through the exquisitely tuned excuses of
statesmen and found in Spain something for which they would, of their
own free will, offer to die. As most of their testimony shows, it was as
simple as that: they made a choice.
There are always choices. The international community can choose to
agree, if it has the appetite, that there is still a place for genocide
in Europe. It can choose, if it prefers, to avert its eyes from mass
rape, ethnic murder, concentration camps, and the deliberate shelling of
civilians. That would be one answer to Bosnia.
It can choose, too, to claim that its formula for peace does not
involve auctioning a free country to its attackers. It can say that it
won't take sides even when the Bosnian Serbs shout their contempt for
all values.
The Serbs started the war and have prosecuted it with barbarism, but
that could be overlooked. It would be another answer.
The international community could also argue, as some MPs argued
yesterday, that public opinion is against deeper involvement.
Chamberlain became hugely popular, after all, when he returned from
Munich with his piece of paper. Politicians could take the line of least
resistance and repeat that the British have no appetite (what sort of
country would we be if we did?) for seeing soldiers die on someone
else's behalf. That would be a third answer.
Versions of these formulae have been attempted over the past three
years but none answers. They are, by turns, despicable and dangerous.
Withdrawal -- vastly more hazardous than real intervention -- would
amount to an agreement that Serbian methods work, that the UN and Nato
will submit to force. What would that mean for Europe's future? A
renewal of peacekeeping -- counting the corpses and feeding those
waiting to die -- would only see the game begin again. Bosnian Serb
tactics are clear enough: achieve your aims by any means necessary,
whether by lying, seizing hostages, sniping at blue berets, or shelling
teenagers in cafes. They will always raise the stakes.
Air strikes by themselves are a gesture whose chief purpose is to
satisfy the American public and their inept President. The Serbs had
threatened to take hostages often enough. Why was anyone surprised when
they did, after the air attacks, and why had no-one guarded against that
eventuality? One truth is that any military action taken now should have
been taken three years ago. Another truth, ironically enough, is that
the war is beginning to go badly for the Bosnian Serbs, a fact likely to
make them still more ruthless, still more dangerous.
Major calls theirs a ''pariah state'' but they can, given the
evidence, live with the reputation. Rifkind warns their leaders that
they will be held personally responsible for the fate of British
captives and they are, to say the least of it, unmoved. The Americans
bluster, the French wonder what to do next. Yet most of this remains
simple enough.
This is not, has never been, simply a civil war, a conveniently
ineluctable conflict between two incomprehensible ethnic groups each as
base as the other. ''Mainly Muslim'' Bosnia (see how racism infiltrates)
is an internationally-recognised multi-ethnic European democracy facing
a genocidal assault. Its opponents are war criminals whose
hostage-taking was far from their first breach of the Geneva
conventions. None of this is seriously in doubt.
Add the dream of ''greater Serbia'', the seizing and purgation of an
area far greater than Bosnia, and you have the choice: Western
complicity in an immense crime or its punishment, appeasement or a real
effort finally to halt the Serbs.
After all, the hostages are informed they are ''prisoners of war''.
There is no ambiguity about the phrase. It is a simple declaration
that the UN is no longer allowed to be neutral. Again, the choice.
Talk of another Vietnam, of a guerrilla war lasting decades, is
misleading. Serbia, economically crippled, has already disowned its
clients in Bosnia. Neither their statelet nor its army will function
without patronage. A war against them would be difficult, but not
impossible; costly, but not as costly as the alternative.
There are many more hostages in Bosnia than the 300 or so soldiers
being held. There are hostages in Sarajevo, in Tuzla, and in all the
other enclaves, thousands of them, each a living consequence for Europe.
Still not our business? Or something, finally, worth fighting for?
Auden's words on Spain stick in the mind when the meaning of Bosnia's
defeat is contemplated. ''We are left alone with our day,'' he wrote,
''and the time is short, and/ History to the defeated/ May say alas but
cannot help or pardon''.

JUDY Harbour, enthuses: ''This is all a new game for me -- it's great
to have advance bookings.'' She is the owner of The Old Schoolhouse, an
eighteenth century building with panoramic views of Loch Lomond.
Judy and her husband, John, who works in the city, are about to
experience their first summer in the Wolsey Lodges scheme -- an upmarket
organisation whereby some of Scotland's most affluent households try
their hand at the bed and breakfast business.
Faced with the upkeep of substantial family properties, 230 UK members
(40 north of the Border and 10 in Europe) are listed in the 1995 Wolsey
Lodges booklet -- so named because Henry VIII's high-living chancellor
expected sumptuous free hospitality on his sojourns round the realm.
Unlike Cardinal Wolsey, however, guests at these establishments can
expect to fork out up to #40 a head for the comfort of a night in a
mansion or castle. Dinner, frequently of cordon bleu standard, sets you
back another #14 to #20.
The Harbours, who live three miles beyond the village of Gartocharn,
bought their property specifically with a view to running it as a
guesthouse. They got into the Suffolk-based Wolsey Lodges scheme in the
best way possible -- by trying it out as customers first.
''We got a brochure and went to stay at a Wolsey lodge called
Ballachulish House in Argyll. I talked in depth with the owner and she
persuaded me it was a good idea,'' recalls Judy Harbour, who has also
stayed at Halfway House on the outskirts of York.
Potential hosts pay #75 for an initial inspection by appointment, plus
an annual fee of around #600, depending on the amount of accommodation.
According to Wolsey Lodges secretary Mary Trelawny, 50 applicants were
inspected last year of which 20 were rejected. Rejections are taken
hard. ''People get very upset. We don't give reasons -- it's invidious
to make rude remarks about private houses.''
Standards are high: inspectors look for good furniture and fittings,
table linen and cutlery. They also check upkeep of grounds and a
hostess's appearance on the day of the visit. It sounds pretty daunting
but Judy Harbour's breezy disposition helps her take it all in her
stride.
''I gave the inspector a good lunch and we seemed to click,'' she
says. ''I work better when on edge. She wanted a feel of the general
ambience. It was a lovely day -- her double bedroom looks out over the
loch.''
So far, Wolsey Lodges is working well for the Harbours. Since entering
the scheme in January, they have received 158 ''bed nights'' and 150
more guests are booked in before September. ''We have lovely people -- a
lot of return bookings -- and they enjoy my cooking,'' says Judy, who
keeps ''standby'' salmon and duck breasts in the freezer and swears by
Lady Claire Macdonald's scone recipe.
Other Wolsey Lodges hostesses are less euphoric: location has a lot to
do with success.
Mrs Irma Wilson-Clarke of The Gunnocks, near Dunblane, is a cordon
bleu cook, owns a beautiful 140-year-old farmhouse -- yet has received
only three guests since January. And as yet she is without advance
bookings. Nonetheless, she is required to pay the annual fee -- in her
case #750. ''Other schemes, like Mansion and Manor, wait until you have
made #1000 profit before demanding a fee,'' she complains.
But like most Wolsey Lodges hostesses The Herald spoke to, Mrs
Wilson-Clarke has found her guests extremely appreciative. After all,
they are briefed in the brochure as to appropriate behaviour for what
should be regarded as ''a social experience''.
Hosts are expected to spend time with guests -- the Earl and Countess
of Lindsay have withdrawn from the 14-year-old scheme now they have five
children. Pre-dinner drinks, afternoon tea and tourist advice are all de
rigueur -- and very demanding on the householder. But so far, the
Harbours thrive on it.
''John lends himself to it. The American ladies think he's wonderful
-- he organises them all,'' says Judy.
Many widows enter the scheme for financial reasons and find hosting
difficult without a spouse. ''You feel half-complete,'' says Mrs
Wilson-Clarke. Lady Maryoth Hay of Forbes Lodge, Gifford, feels
similarly but enjoys the variety.
''When I first opened, I had an Oriental couple who asked if I minded
smoking,'' she says. ''I said not in the bedroom. After they left, my
daily said she couldn't get my dog out of their bedroom -- he seemed
fascinated by the smell. It turned out to be cannabis.''

CHARLES McSherry has the world at his fingertips, and is making tracks
on the information superhighway. A keystroke at the Royal Crescent
offices of Glasgow-based computer systems retailer Prosys will appear on
a terminal in Pennsylvania, courtesy of British Telecom and US sector
stablemate AT&amp;T's ISDN2 technology.
The equipment which enables this -- two boxes the size of mini-CD
players -- may not look much.
However, it was this compact technology which allowed McSherry,
Prosys's managing director, to secure a #200,000 deal with L&amp;N Max
Control Systems in North Wales, outside Philadelphia.
Dramatic advances in communications have enabled Prosys to provide
systems support from Glasgow. ''Land bridges'' and ISDN2 technology
allow Prosys to be part of L&amp;N's computer network and vice-versa.
According to McSherry, this arrangement gives Prosys 10 or 20 times
the access power of a standard dial-in arrangement using a normal modem.
L&amp;N, a division of Essex-based Industrial Control Systems with a
turnover of about $30m, manufactures control systems for power stations,
largely in China and the Far East.
With L&amp;N having a raft of issues to manage during the two to four-year
lives of its various contracts, Prosys's project and manufacturing
control system has to ensure such essentials as the scheduling of
materials for the right time and in the correct sequence.
Having convinced L&amp;N in February of the benefits of a system based on
UK computer giant Misys's Strategix software, customised by Prosys,
McSherry, 36, got the bold project up and running last month.
For Prosys, which has a turnover of #975,000 and a staff of 16, the US
contract is a fairly major one.
McSherry's preoccupation with it is, therefore, not hard to
understand.
He said: ''Since I put the system in, I have been a bit like a cat on
a griddle. I have actually been phoning them to check it is working but
there has been nothing wrong.
''We are sitting here with all this hardware and we can't play with
it.''
The US contract materialised out of work Prosys had done for Ian Kimm
at ICS in Grangemouth. He subsequently moved to the US and ended up with
responsibility for L&amp;N's computer function.
McSherry said: ''The phone call literally came out of the blue, and he
said he hadn't seen anything that he liked over there, and would I be
interested in coming out and doing some consultancy work.
''I went over for three days and did a root and branch analysis of
their business and their IT requirements. I made a presentation and they
accepted the proposals.''
Mr McSherry owns 60% of Prosys, with fellow working director Tom Smith
holding a 40% stake. The company has about 100 customers throughout
Scotland, deriving about half of its turnover from Strategix-based
systems at 12 sites.
Prosys, which is also developing clinical software for Glasgow's
Yorkhill Hospital, does work for Dundee-based denture company Wright
Health Group. Among its other major customers are East Lothian,
Clackmannan and Hamilton District Councils.
Set up in 1987 as Accounting Software Consultants, when the world and
his dog were scrabbling to become part of the business start-up
explosion, the company grew throughout the subsequent recession.
On Hogmanay, all stationery and boot-up discs bearing the old name,
which had become a misnomer, were consigned to the dustbin and Prosys
was born.
Although he has an information technology background, Mr McSherry sees
it as his job to point Prosys in the right direction and relies on the
boffins on the payroll to keep abreast of developments.
He said: ''Technology is running like an express train. It is almost
impossible even when you are in the business to keep up with it.
''I just say, 'Can we do this?' and they say, 'We can do this. This is
how we do it'.''

THE Royal Mile is soon to have some artistic flourishes to add to its
old town charm.
When you walk down some of the winding narrow closes cast your eyes up
to see the new overthrows, that's the bits which go high on the closes
to take the signs.
Elspeth Bennie and her partner Steve Payne, based in Balfron, designed
and created these overthrows.
Elspeth started off her career as a sculptor. ''I started in 1988. I
studied sculpture in art school and I was doing metalwork then. I
thought setting up a workshop would be a good way to make metalwork, but
the blacksmithing took over''.
Steve started off as a television effects man, providing explosions
and fires for programmes like The Bill and London's Burning. His keen
interest in metalwork led to a two-year blacksmithing course followed by
a BA in three-dimensional design.
Elspeth worked on two designs. ''The larger one is for the Old
Fishmarket Close, so it's going to have a lot of fish on it. The one for
Gullans Close is just a pure design, sort of pushed out coils.''
As to the future: ''Some sort of big architectural commission would be
really nice, or a restaurant or something where we could do what we
wanted -- money no object!''

HERE'S the scenario. You've got an urgent fax to send to an important
client. You rush along the corridor to where the fax is stored only to
discover the marketing manager sending a 100-page document to Guatemala
and he'll be at least half-an-hour. Meanwhile there are six other people
in the queue ahead of you who are giving you dirty looks.
The fax has had a revolutionary effect on offices, but when you
analyse just how it works, it is not the most efficient or the cheapest
solution to communication.
Faxes are often illegible, they don't always transmit first time, they
use expensive paper which fades with time and you need a hard copy of
anything you want to send. They don't allow you to send the same fax to
multiple sources without having to physically stand over the machine for
the afternoon.
The answer to all of these problems lies in the latest fax software
for PC's which is cheap, efficient, and easy to install. Material can be
sent direct from your PC terminal to multiple sources, without first
printing out, using your existing database of names and addresses and
without you needing to be involved once the send command has been given.
You can also incorporate graphics from your database and large
sections of desktop published material which wouldn't reproduce well
using a fax but are perfect through your PC.
To use fax software you need a PC, a class I or class II modem, and
one of the latest programs available for your machine. The first thing
to note is that your software must be compatible with your modem, not
the other way round, so buy the software first then select the modem
from the list provided in the manual.
Once the system is set up, and this software is very user-friendly,
then you should have a basic fax capable of sending multiple faxes, able
to store material using icons from your existing word processing
software, and able to link with any other PC or fax fitted with a modem.
The best fax software to date is only available for those with Windows
as the DOS programs are a bit clumsy and unmanageable. However, given
the speed of change in the computer software market, this situation is
likely to improve as companies adapt their products to meet shifting
consumer requirements.
There are a number available ranging in price from ''free'' all the
way up to around #170. The cheapest available, in that it comes free
with the Windows for Workgroups 3.11 software, is the Workgroup FAX
Add-on. This is a basic package which allows you all the standard fax
functions but without sophistication. This software is excellent for the
casual user but not for a busy office.
Beware of companies trying to sell you more than you require. There
are numerous software packages available which incorporate a number of
other functions you may not need.
If you only need a fax then the Commworks for Windows by Travelling
Software may not be for you. Priced at #169.95 it has five separate
components including laplink, TS Outline, Laplink Alert, Laplink Remote
Access, and TS Fax. The quality of these various functions is not in
doubt, but they are a bit superfluous if all you need is a simple fax.
This software also comes with an exclusively American list of modems
which may be difficult to locate.
FAXNOW 2.22 costs #119 and is written for Windows 3.11 so is
compatible with the majority of systems available in the UK. FAXNOW
creates its own program group, adds icons for the FAX Manager, a FAX
viewer, and has a good phonebook.
One thing you do need if you intend using the FAX facility a lot is to
be able to call up the names and addresses from your existing database,
otherwise you may end up spending a lot of time simply keying material
into the phonebook in the FAX program. The FAXNOW program allows you to
use existing icons and add the parts of the existing database which you
need, making this fast, reliable, efficient, visually familiar, and very
flexible.
Another package which allows you to do all of the above functions and
add the details from your Lotus Organiser into its phonebook is the
WinFAx Pro 4.0 costing #99. This has loads of good features, good modem
complimentation, and allows good use of the Microsoft Mail list.
The downside is that it uses a massive 10Mb of memory, which can be
reduced to 5.5Mb if you don't use a lot of the pre-designed pages. But
if this package were to be used in conjunction with other heavy
memory-consuming packages then problems could occur.
The main point to remember when buying PC Fax software is to buy
something which most accurately reflects your business needs. Don't buy
too much software if all you want is a simple fax, and make sure the
program you buy doesn't use up too much memory and is capable of drawing
material from your existing database.

THE often tortuous journey through London Heathrow, the world's
busiest international airport, has been eased by the opening of a unique
centre aimed solely at the connecting passenger.
The importance of the Flight Connection Centre for Scottish passengers
is clear as Edinburgh and Glasgow are the second and third most popular
destinations for connecting passengers.
In addition a large percentage of those using Heathrow begin their
journeys at a Scottish airport with their ultimate destination in Europe
or further afield. Over 150,000 passengers a year connect through
Heathrow from Glasgow alone.
The centre is part of a #100m package of improvements to the ageing
Terminals One and Two at the airport, and has been developed with the
assistance of British Airways which is the airport's biggest customer.
Although the centre is in its infancy, passengers are already
reporting an improvement in comfort. Now the airport operators, part of
the BAA group, are promising a cut in journey times through the airport
of around 20 minutes.
Mike Wolff, one of the senior BAA managers behind the centre, said:
''There was no doubt we had to take action to maintain our position as
the leading connections airport. Rival airports like Charles De Gaulle
in Paris, Amsterdam Schipol, and Frankfurt have been making considerable
efforts to improve their service.
Passengers will make a fast air-side connection to the centre and will
no longer have to undergo a second security check at Heathrow.
A bank of check-in and information desks is on the top floor of the
centre with access by coach to and from Terminals Three and Four on the
ground. The innovative aspect of the centre is on the middle floor with
improved seating, children's play area and a rest and relaxation area
which passengers pay a charge for.
The R&amp;R area, run by Thomas Cook, has a slumber zone, showers, work
stations and refreshments. Mr Woolf said it was designed to ''complement
but not to replace'' the executive clubs run by major airlines.
The improvements for connecting passengers -- a total of 7.5 million
or over 30% of the total each year -- have been made following a
detailed report of the behaviour and needs of such travellers throughout
the world.
The research showed that few connecting passengers leave the airport,
all left home at least three, and some as much as 24 hours before their
departure -- 77% are facing a long-haul flight.
Rather unkindly it discloses that most are out of their time zone,
many dressed for another climate and that the majority are ''tired,
dehydrated, crumpled, and generally disorientated''.

THE healing power of seaweed has long been known to the medical
establishment but when a Renfrew woman found 100-year-old Scottish
recipes for skin creams incorporating a rare seaweed, she decided to
reproduce the ancient healing lotions.
Eventually Erica Kerr and her husband Jake sold up their garden centre
to concentrate on recreating the balms and remedies using natural
ingredients found in Scotland.
She explains: ''We wanted to develop a business which was
environmentally friendly and would draw on our knowledge of plants and
nature. When we heard from friends of the existence of these old recipes
in Inveraray we travelled to meet the current owners and were delighted
when they agreed to sell them to us.''
Her skin and hair care collection has been named after Diana Drummond,
the daughter of a Highland chieftain who lived during the reign of James
IV and was said to have healing powers.
The venture has been supported by Renfrewshire Enterprise who advised
Erica Kerr to contact Self Starters, RE's women only business centre in
Greenock. They gave advice on setting up a manufacturing base in Port
Glasgow to produce and package the collection and help with marketing.
Erica says: ''Although I had a lot of experience of running a business
I had no knowledge of setting up a manufacturing facility. Our local
enterprise company played a significant role in helping us establish
ourselves as a new business.''
June heralds the start of the seaweed cutting season for the Kerrs and
they set off by boat from Largs for a location off the West coast to
collect their seaweed. The type of weed and its home is a closely
guarded secret -- all they will divulge is that it only grows in the
cleanest of waters off the Western Isles.

WITH the opening on May 26 of the new atrium entrance to Glasgow's
Granite House office complex in Stockwell Street, phase one of Allied
London &amp; Scottish Properties PLC's #5m commercial development is now
complete.
Tenants already in situ are insurance company Canada Life, architects
Gilchrist/Briggs and ABB Flakt Marine. Strathclyde Regional Council will
be occupying two floors later in the year.
Phase two is planned to incorporate a 25,000 sqft terraced extension
to Osborne Street and a hi-tech fully automated medium rise car park in
the modern Japanese manner with accommodation for 600 cars -- the first
of its kind in Scotland.
Allied London &amp; Scottish Properties plc is the cross-border company
which was formed in June 1994 as the Scottish investment subsidiary of
Allied London Properties plc. ALP has an 80% shareholding while the
remaining 20% is owned by Barrie Clapham, a Glasgow-based property
developer and investor and managing director of ALSP.
At the outset two major Glasgow retail and light industrial properties
changed hands in an #11.3m deal. Clydeway Business Centre which
incorporates the new Clydeway Sky Park at the junction of the Clydeside
Expressway and Finnieston Street and the red sandstone city landmark
Granite House, a 126,000 sqft office leisure and warehouse building on
Stockwell Street and Trongate became part of the Allied London &amp;
Scottish Properties plc portfolio.
The properties have been valued on an open market basis by Knight,
Frank &amp; Rutley at #11.285m.
As Sir Geoffrey Laigh, chairman of both ALP and ALSP, indicated at the
time, ''This major investment in Scotland is part of the continuing
strategy of Allied London to broaden the base of its investment
portfolio throughout the United Kingdom. Allied London &amp; Scottish
Properties plc will be looking at further opportunities north of the
Border as we have the benefit of Allied London's strong balance sheet
together with an experienced Scottish management team.''
Managing director of ALSP Barrie Clapham commented at Friday's
opening, ''We have succeeded in our original plan to make Granite House
more office and design based with clients like Canada Life and
Gilchrist/Briggs architects. Space is our product and our aim is to
deliver to our tenants what they, as our customers, want. Service is
important and our effective and proven small management team keeps
on-costs to a minimum.''
He continued, ''In the expanding field of property management
development and investment Allied London &amp; Scottish Properties intends
to become one of the top three companies of its type in Scotland within
five years or by the beginning of the twenty-first century. Our
portfolio has achieved a value of #30m in less than a year so we are
definitely on target.''
The Granite House building occupies a commanding situation in the
heart of Glasgow. At the corner of Argyle Street and Stockwell Street it
is conveniently located for shops, theatres, cinemas and restaurants
with easy access to Glasgow's transport services. St Enoch underground
station is a short step away and Scotrail's Glasgow Central and Queen
Street stations are close at hand. The M8 motorway can be reached in
just a few minutes as can the Clydeside Expressway.
Granite House has been part of Glasgow's historic cityscape since
horses and carts and trams trundled their way over the Trongate cobbles.
The new entrance in Stockwell Street retains the original wrought iron
gates with heraldic Glasgow shields which lead to the building's third
light well. Today they lead on to the attractive atrium and
terrazzo-tiled court which houses an exhibition by local artist Joseph
Eurie on its Vienna Secession inspired white walls in the Hoffman/Wagner
mode.
Natural light from the glazed roof imbues an international touch,
enhanced by the wall climber style lifts which serve the five floors.
A bronze and granite lectern with the floor plan in stainless steel
incorporates lift buttons for the west and east wings of the impressive
entrance hall. A colourful Glasgow coat of arms from the building's
facade is set into the Italian marble floor under reinforced glass.
The building's construction is open-plan offering a total floor area
of around 100,000 sqft. Entire floors are available up to 30,000 sqft
and individual office suites can be created from 2000 to 10,000 sqft.
Granite House offers exceptional value for premises in such a central
location. It comprises low-cost modern office space on the flexi-spec
principle of flexible terms and specifications including full
institutional repairing and insuring terms incorporating five-yearly
rent reviews. Institutional quality has been brought to an area of town
not normally associated with high quality office accommodation.
Local architectural firm McGurn Logan Duncan &amp; Opfer was responsible
for phase one of the prestige project. What were flatted factories for
the garment trade of yesterday have been transformed into the quality
office accommodation of today. Floor five is a fully accessible raised
access floor to serve the building's modern IT or info-tech cabling and
other underfloor requirements of the modern business world.
The white brick of the original light well was covered over and
painted to spectacular effect and the heavy goods lift shafts were
adapted to stylish passenger use. The atrium or central court is already
much in demand by fashion photographers because of its light qualities
and European flavour.
Granite House resident architects Gilchrist/Briggs will be responsible
for phase two. Steve Comer's model of the completed project on display
on the fifth floor came in for favourable comment. The revolutionary
fully automated car park for 600 cars, in current use in Sweden and
Japan, is fast, secure and environmentally friendly.
To herald the opening of phase one, Canada Life threw a lunch party at
which a cheque for #1000 was handed over to Scotland's Chest Heart and
Stroke Association by business manager Ian McDickom. Canada Life opened
its first office in Glasgow in 1906 and the company's decision to remain
in the centre of Glasgow in its new Granite House offices continues a
long tradition.

A PROMINENT Dundee building has just been given two new leases of
life.
The first came with the total refurbishment of No 1 Courthouse Square,
by Scottish Enterprise Tayside in conjunction with private investors.
With a view to attracting companies to the city, the developers were
banking on the idea that the 16,500 sq ft building could attract
prestigious tenants into Dundee. It would seem that the bankers were
impressed.
The building's second new lease of life came with National Westminster
Bank's agreement to lease part of the ground and first floors.
SET's chief executive, Graham McKee, said: ''The decision of National
Westminster Bank to locate to Tayside is encouraging from the
perspective of inward investment.''

TWO heavyweight property contenders are set to lock horns in Glasgow
well into the next century. The prize is nothing less than city
shoppers.
If you thought there were enough shops in Glasgow, think again. Two
massive retail schemes -- one in the city centre and one on the
outskirts -- are limbering up to battle for supremacy.
While all eyes were focused on a planning appeal by the controversial
Braehead scheme near Renfrew, the city centre made its own approach to
the planning department.
The Buchanan Centre Partnership, developers of the Buchanan Centre
which will adjoin the Royal Concert Hall at the top of Buchanan Street,
has applied for a 600,000 sq ft scheme which will include a 300,000 sq
ft John Lewis store, the retailer's largest outlet in Scotland.
The developers hope to transform the top end of the city centre,
creating a new Z-shaped pattern in which Glaswegians will do their
shopping by walking along Sauchiehall Street and into the new centre,
then stroll down Buchanan Street and finish up on Argyle Street.
They claim that the area linking Sauchiehall Street to Buchanan Street
will be the focus of regeneration for the whole city centre.
If everything goes according to plan, the new shopping complex will be
complete by 1999, Glasgow's year as City of Architecture and Design.
The development, on which a detailed consent already exists, has been
revised ''to reflect changing retail requirements and presents the John
Lewis Partnership with a level of representation justified by their
status in the market,'' according to the developers.
Sandy Cook, director of the Buchanan Centre Partnership and a leading
figure behind the Paisley Centre and Aberdeen's Bon Accord Centre, said:
''This is a very important development for the city of Glasgow, and it
was important that we waited until the plans were absolutely right
before we applied for planning consent.
''The detailed work which has been carried out over recent months will
ensure that this development will be in keeping with the Royal Concert
Hall, a building of architectural significance, as well as providing a
retail facility which will benefit the people of Glasgow.''
Construction work is scheduled to start this autumn with completion
anticipated in the spring of 1999.
As well as the proposed John Lewis anchor store, the development will
contain retail units ranging from 500 sq ft to 50,000 sq ft, with
parking for 2000 cars.
The Buchanan Centre is to be developed by The Buchanan Centre
Partnership, a joint venture between subsidiaries of Slough Estates plc
and AMP Asset Management plc.
Meanwhile the Braehead developers have vowed to start work on their
own massive scheme. Can the city support both? Glaswegians are
enthusiastic shoppers, but at least one of the two retail contenders may
prove to be over-developed for the city's needs.

THIS month, Finger on the Pulse looks at a piece of Government
legislation imported from down south that is causing uproar amongst
Scotland's business community and members of Glasgow Chamber of
Commerce.
Some of the kinder adjectives are ''lousy'', ''destructive'' and
''ruinous''. Empty property rates -- or The Non-Domestic Rating
(Unoccupied Property) (Scotland) Regulations 1994 -- are the problem.
The legislation came into effect in April as part of the harmonisation
of UK business rates. Although delighted to have a UK Business Rates
(UBR) agreement, the business community threw up its arms in despair at
its consequences. As the first rates are due for collection at the end
of the month, feelings are running higher than ever.
For more than 20 years, Glasgow Chamber of Commerce led the campaign
for rates throughout England and Scotland to be standardised on ''a
level playing field''. The goal was finally achieved in April this year
with the help of Scottish Secretary Ian Lang. However, as far as the
business community is concerned, there is little cause for celebration.
Indeed it seems to be more a case of commiseration as the bitter pill of
empty rates is swallowed and its side-effects fully digested.
The legislation, which has been in existence in England since the late
1960s, means that unoccupied commercial property with a rateable value
of more than #1500 will be liable for rates at 50% of the full rate
after it has been empty for three months.
The business community has hit out at these ''empty rates'', warning
of the effects they will have on Scotland's economy which is just
starting to emerge from recession. There have been grave warnings that
the rates will penalise those who can least afford it -- businesses who
have vacated properties to ease their overheads.
Gloomy predictions of property being vandalised to avoid the charge,
as is apparently happening in England, are also being made. The business
community is calling for England's empty rates to be harmonised with
Scotland's -- ie abolished. However, this plea has so far fallen on deaf
ears and rate collectors are now bracing themselves for a difficult task
at the beginning of next month.
But what exactly are the implications of this legislation, how will it
affect business in West of Scotland and why is the business community
pushing for its repeal? Glasgow Chamber of Commerce, Scotland's largest
business organisation, has the answers, and its members are united in
the condemnation of the Act.
First stop was Geoffrey Johnston, managing director of Arbuckle Smith
&amp; Co, who has campaigned for the past 20 years for a unified business
rate in the UK. Unfortunately, his pleasure at finally seeing a UBR for
Scotland has been soured by what he calls ''a piece of lousy English
legislation''.
''This destructive and ruinous legislation was brought in to deal with
the speculative property boom in the late 1960s. As always, legislation
in haste, dealing with a political problem, is lousy legislation. The
legislation was wrong to deal with the issue at the time when it was
passed but during the recession of the early 1980s and the early 1990s,
it was totally destructive of business and properties. The only possible
beneficiary from the legislation was the Treasury and the sufferers have
been many.
''The system in Scotland, prior to the imposition of this appalling
legislation, worked well. The only possible justification for not
adopting the Scottish policy throughout the UK is that the Treasury
wants the money. This is not a sufficient excuse for economic vandalism
and we would call upon all UK business representative organisations to
fight for the repeal of this legislation throughout the UK and to
substitute the well-tried Scottish system.''
Robert Orr, director at James Barr and Son, was concerned about the
''victims'' of the legislation.
''A rates charge on empty buildings was introduced in England to
penalise owners who deliberately kept their property vacant during a
period of rental and capital growth. These conditions do not exist in
the 1990s. In fact, it has been brought here at a time when
representations are being made to have the practice stopped in the
South. So much for complete harmonisation.
''I feel the consequences of this legislation will be to penalise
businesses who can least afford it -- those who have vacated property to
ease their overheads. It will not help get empty buildings occupied and
could increase the cost of new development. Furthermore, the last thing
we want to see is constructive vandalism of buildings to prevent this
charge being levied.''
These warnings were echoed by Nick McCaffery, associate director,
Peter Campbell &amp; Co.
''Empty rates have serious implications for the property market.
Speculative development will be put on hold as developers will not
relish the prospect of picking up 50% of the rates bill in the event
that they are unable to secure tenants.
''Properties which are uninhabitable are excluded, and there is
therefore the macabre possibility of buildings being intentionally
vandalised in order to avoid payment of empty rates.
''I also envisage some 'soft' lettings, both in terms of rentals and
tenant convenants, taking place in the property in order to displace the
rating liability. This may distort rental levels, which would have a
knock-on effect for rent reviews and investment transactions.
''A potentially bigger problem is the effect on relocations which
create activity in the property market. A relocation may be put on hold
until existing accommodation is disposed of as the costs of holding
vacant property become punitive. These empty rates can only have a
downward effect on the property market, which currently requires
measures to stimulate activity and growth.''
Finally, Mike Cantlay, managing director of the Hector Russell
Kiltmaker Group, expressed disappointment over the legislation and said
the empty rates would discourage business expansion. He also expressed
his concern over the exemptions to the legislation.
''Allowing exemptions like industrial properties and listed buildings
is grossly unfair. Take, for example, two empty shops side by side. One
might be paying rates and one not, simply because the latter is housed
within a listed building.
''Whilst I welcome the arrival of the UBR, there has been no
acknowledgement that many Scottish businesses have for years been paying
higher rates, in comparitive terms, than the rest of Britain.
''I can't help feeling that an opportunity has been lost to reform the
whole system of commercial rating and in particular the appeal system.
We are still in a position where the vast majority of commercial
ratepayers have to appeal.''
The business brouhaha looks set to continue. We asked chief executive
of Glasgow Chamber of Commerce, Mr Geoff Runcie, to have the last word:
''Harmonisation is always something which can bring the best and the
worst of any legislation or system together, and in this case we
certainly have the best and the worst as far as Scottish businesses are
concerned.
''Sadly, I have to agree that although the Act calls for a provision
by the rating authorities to avoid hardship cases, generally speaking,
commercial property owners and managers will face this additional rates
burden.
''In monetary terms the additional revenue to the Treasury from this
rates levy in Scotland will be relatively small, although the
implications of removing this levy in England may be more sizeable. If
Scottish and, more generally, British businesses are to be more
competitive, then the last thing they need is a punitive disincentive by
virtue of a rates levy on property which in many cases is surplus to
requirements.
''The period of recession has meant that most businesses have slimmed
down in a property sense to the minimum required space and, therefore,
many are carrying surplus property on their books. They, by their very
nature, are the ones who are least able to deal with the on-cost of an
additional rates burden.
''The Government's latest competitiveness paper calls for businesses
to invest in new products and services, and just at a time when the
economic situation is improving, we may have many Scottish businesses
having to pay an additional tax burden rather than investing in their
competitiveness.
''Commonsense must prevail and harmonisation used as a positive tool
by relieving all businesses of the empty property tax.''

THE public is dazzled by stars, superb locations, and stunts or
special effects when at the movies or watching television but a great
deal goes on behind the scenes to catch that magic moment on camera. And
it is this off-camera activity which makes film and television
production such a highly labour-intensive industry, and therefore very
attractive to areas of high unemployment.
The wide range of skills and services needed to make a film can be
seen from a glance at Film Bang, the directory of Scotland's film and
video industry.
Contained within its covers are details of helicopter companies,
animal agents, camera equipment, lighting, location catering, model
makers, make-up effects, and special vehicle hire.
David Stewart of Creature Feature is an example of the services
required by the film industry.
During the past five years, David has supplied film companies with
giant snails, tame bulls, parrots, and a condor vulture as well as the
more run of the mill animals such as dogs, cats, and deer.
He became involved in the film industry by accident while he was
visiting a friend's deer farm in the North of Scotland.
David, a biologist, was asked to help out on a film set with some of
the deer after a company from England had hired his friend to supply the
animals.
''I realised that there was a niche for this type of company in
Scotland, and slowly built up a database of animals. I am the interface
between the animals and the film companies,'' explains David. ''I now
have a huge database of animal owners who can supply anything from an
elephant to monkeys or giant snails.''
David runs a small farm at Ae, eleven miles north of Dumfries, on
which he has two dogs, two cats, sheep, and goldfish. But he admits that
he does not normally own the animals he supplies, Otherwise, he says, he
would have to have a ''rather large zoo''.
His company Creature Feature supplied the West Highland terrier, Wee
Jock, who became a favourite with viewers after appearing in the Hamish
McBeth series.
Wee Jock was killed in the fifth episode of the series and viewers
expressed their disappointment at his passing.
But says David Stewart. ''Wee Jock actually comes from Dumfries. His
real name is Zippy and he is alive and well.''
Followers of Taggart will see another of David's stars in the next
series. ''I supplied the large green parrot, which viewers will see
sitting on top of a naked body,'' he says.
Anyone who saw Robbie Coltrane in Johnson &amp; Boswells Tour of the
Western Isles will recall the snail race on top of a tombstone.
''I had to get the 12 snails for this scene from down south, as the
snails up here were still hibernating,'' explains David. He laughs as he
adds: ''It is one of the problems which I sometimes face that film
companies, for example, will want deer with antlers just after the deer
have shed their antlers.''
Other examples of Creature Feature animal stars include the Condor
Vulture which appears in the Edinburgh Festival advert with the slogan
''fresh meat for culture''.
But it is not only David's animals who appear in front of the cameras.
David has appeared in a number of television films and series along with
the animals he has provided. In Tell-tale Hearts, which featured Bill
Paterson, he was seen dressed as a policeman with a German shepherd dog,
and in the Para Handy television series he appeared as a farm worker
holding a bull.
''I got the bull from a breeder of pedigree cattle who was known to
have tame animals but I still had to handle the bull when it was being
filmed.''
His job is not without its funny side such as when he had to supply a
Jersey cow for the kiddies FOT false or true television series.
''The cow had to be dressed up in women's lingerie including stockings
and suspenders. It really was quite a sight.''
The welfare of the animals being used in the film and television
industry is protected by the Performing Animals Regulations Act, and
David is licensed to work with the animals involved.
The staff canteen is obviously not available when the television and
film companies are on location, and there are several companies in
Scotland, including V.I.P. Location Catering, who specialise in feeding
crews during filming.
Victor Grainger, a qualified chef, formed V.I.P. four years ago after
working for an American firm of caterers in this field in London.
Since coming to Scotland, he has worked regularly on locations for
Doctor Finlay's casebook and was recently preparing to go to Ullapool
where scenes for Machair were being shot.
Victor has catered for up to 300 extras at a time between shots and
has two mobile kitchens which are transported around on semi-articulated
lorries.
''We certainly find ourselves preparing food in some strange locations
including in the middle of a blizzard at the top of the Rest and Be
Thankful and at the old lead mines in Bo'Ness where it was bitterly cold
and a mixture of rain and snow,'' explains Victor. He worked as a chef
for most of his career in comfortable hotels in Torquay before moving
into the entertainment business.
Another location catering company is Reel Food, who have three
kitchens on the road and have supplied food to 475 on the set of a
German film which was being shot in Glasgow.
Guy Cowan, the owner of Reel Food is in Manchester this week where an
episode of Cracker is being filmed.
He told me: ''I have been operating in the industry for five years,
and we have worked on many films including Shallow Grave.''
With the expansion of the film industry in Scotland, one thing seems
certain. There will be more mouths to feed on and around the sets, and
the location catering side of the business should be set to grow
alongside the cameras.
As for a similar growth in demand for animals in Scottish-based films,
anyone who has seen Rob Roy will agree that our Highland cows make
better film stars than American longhorns any day.

THE first talks aimed at establishing a strategic alliance between
Scotland and the area of America known as Laser Alley took place here
last week.
Central Florida earned its name because of the number of laser
companies within a small area. Contracts between the Scottish
Optoelectronics Association and the Florida-based Center for Research
and Education in Optics and Lasers (CREOL) were made in Baltimore.
Thirteen of the association's member companies were taking part in a
Scottish Trade International mission to America's biggest
optoelectronics conference and exhibition.
It is too early to predict the outcome of a laser pact with Florida.
But the mission itself has exceeded expectations in the amount of
business companies are likely to win.
''We got 600 inquiries,'' said Andy Smith, of Glasgow based Photonex
which makes an innovative spectrometer for laboratory use. ''We pick out
about 30 key potential customers. It has shown that there is a market
here.
''One of the other things I came for was to look at distributorships.
At the moment I am looking at four people. What is amazing has been the
quality of the contracts.''
The day after the exhibition closed Photonex had a meeting with the
strongly influential National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) in Washington. An order from NIST which, it was hinted, was
distinctly possible would transform Photonex's profile in the US.
Even without that, the four-man company is expecting to win up to
#60,000 worth of business a year.
Logitech, which makes precision cutting and polishing systems at its
base in Old Kilpatrick, near Glasgow expects to win around #500,000
worth of business over two years. ''I have been on a lot of missions all
over the world,'' said marketing manager David Humphries, ''this has
been the best''.
Even a company like Isocom Components of Tranent, East Lothian which
makes light emitting diodes (LEDs), struck it lucky. It realised when
the exhibition opened that it was not the right menu for its product.
''Really this was a laser show,'' said its chairman Dr David Simpson.
''But we got an inquiry about supplying one million devices. That's
Serendipity. It's a significant inquiry, equivalent to about a month's
production.''
In all cases the reationships formed have been more important than any
immediate business. Bookham Technology makes the fibre-optic
transceivers which the American Auto Electronics Industry Development
Association has targeted as critical with the growth of information
super-highways, was looking for potential distributors. It has
established a relationship with the important Gould Corporation.
Tayside Optical is one of the suppliers for a bid by the US Naval
Research Laboratories to build a satellite for NASA. ''Our meeting was
extremely important from the point of view of giving them additional
confidence,'' said Graeme Robb. ''It's giving them the feeling that we
really want the work. It's a credibility factor.''

MARK Jordan, an engineer on the Sante Fe Road railway, thinks that our
rail set-up in Scotland is great.
And the engineer -- locomotive driver in our language -- can't
understand why there's so much concern and debate over them.
For, on a recent visit to relatives in Scotland, Mark indulged in
something of a traindriver's holiday, and took a good, hard, and
professional look at the railway business here.
Despite wet and windy weather, he travelled the rails to Fort William,
Edinburgh, and Stranraer and marvelled at the wonderful passenger
service on offer.
''Back home,'' said Mark, who operates out of Houston, Texas, ''we
have nothing like your passenger business. I'm, amazed at the very high
standard of your trains, stations and track. I can't see what people are
worried about. Your Scottish railway system is very good indeed on the
passenger side.''
But, Mark, who spends his working day at the controls of a mighty
freight diesel, at the head of a train which runs to anything up to
half-a-mile in length, just can't understand the Scottish approach to
rail freight.
''I did see the new freightliner terminal at Mossend,'' he conceded.
''But, that apart, I simply can't understand why next to nothing travels
by rail.''
On Mark's railway, freight, bulk haulage of coal, chemicals, motor
vehicles, and piggy-backing of road lorries and double-decker container
wagons, is the way business is done. What little passenger work there
is, comes a very poor second.
And the Santa Fe makes a profit on freight. So much so, that it's
recently merged with another private company, the Burlington Northern,
to make even more out of freight.
Mark is first to admit that distances are shorter in Scotland. But, he
says, with the Channel Tunnel now on line, there can be no excuse for
not exploiting rail freight.
''The fact is, in my mind, Glasgow is sitting pretty to be the
European rail gateway for trade to and from the US,'' he enthused.
''Just as tobacco ships chose Glasgow as the nearest port to the US in
the past, so container ships with cargo for Europe could dock at Glasgow
and transfer their containers on to rail for direct running to Europe.
That would have to be faster and cheaper than shipping containers to
Europe,'' he explained.
And Mark can't see anything to fear from a private railway system.
''I've worked for a private rail system all my working life, and it
doesn't bother me,'' he added. ''But I have to admit, that talking to
drivers in Scotland, conditions of employment are very different.''
On the Santa Fe, in common with other US railroad agreements with
engineers, Mark gets paid only for the miles he actually drives.
If the train is shunted into a siding, Mark, in sole control of three
diesel locomotives working in multiple, stops earning. And some turns
can mean being away from home for up to 40 hours continuously.
Average annual earnings for an engineer work out about #35,000, more
than a ScotRail driver, although annual leave at 20 days, is similar.
But Mark says that direct comparisons can be misleading. His railway,
the Santa Fe, is a profit maker based firmly on a steady, growing, and
high-earning freight market.
And does the man who spends his holidays looking at the other man's
railway have a message for Scots worried about the future of their rail
system?
''Yes,'' warns Mark. ''Firstly, appreciate just how good the passenger
service you have really is. It's way ahead of anything in the States.
But, secondly, get freight back on the rails. I just can't believe how
backward Scotland is in this respect. And I can't understand how lines
such as the West Highland and Stranraer survive without freight haulage
of the sort we have back home. If you want to keep those lines and your
passenger trains, get into the freight business, fast.''

UNTIL recently you could perhaps have said that Magnus Magnusson and
the sharing of a cold northern latitude were the only obvious links
between Scotland and Iceland.
But in August last year, Atlantic Information Systems became the first
company in Scotland to be established with capital from Iceland. It is a
sister company of Iceland Software Inc. of Reykjavik.
David Farquhar, managing director, explains the completely new ethos
which his company, which is based in the West of Scotland Science Park
in Glasgow, brings to its operations, and its innovative approach to
software and its application to individual client's requirements.
Atlantic Information Systems differs from other software manufacturers
and suppliers in two broad areas, says Farquhar. Firstly in the way the
business is run; secondly in the way the products are made and serviced.
The company's internal management philosophy is based on treating
staff as individuals within a team. As in the sister company in Iceland,
there is no hierarchical structure. There are no job descriptions, no
job titles. Every employee is trained to accept responsibility for
himself or herself, for the customers, for the products and services
which the company provides, and for colleagues within the team.
All are involved in forming a general set of values -- the goals of
the company, the aim to provide high quality products which will improve
the profitability of client companies, the uniquely close relationship
with client companies, the philosophy of continuous improvement, the
commitment to keep the company's negative impact on the environment as
low as possible.
All are involved in a more specific set of targets -- the rate of
growth of sales, the best ways of servicing the customers, the
development of the software, the company's profitability, particular
methods of employee training, and so on.
The consequence of this open and holistic approach to employees has,
says Farquhar, been spectacular. Productivity is exceptionally high;
long hours are put in by enthusiastic and committed team members;
everyone thinks more laterally.
Eight new recruits, all graduates, are about to join the company,
doubling its size.
The next objective is the assault on the English market. Strong
interest has already been expressed by several prospective clients; and
Farquhar expects that by the end of this year there will be two
satellite offices in England.
The second radical plank on which AIS has built its success is, says
Farquhar, the relationship the company tries to build with its
customers. It offers a very personalised service, providing individual
systems, each uniquely designed with flexibility for the particular
customer's needs.
It then offers a perpetual support programme so that at every stage
improvements and changes can be incorporated. As part of a group of
software companies which has been operating since 1983, manufacturing
and supporting the state-of-the-art opusalt family of management
information systems, it is able to present the very highest quality
products.
One more way in which AIS is ahead of the field is its commitment to
equal opportunities. An ex-sergeant-major acts as office receptionist.
And when he's not making excellent coffee, he is drafting the quality
business manual in preparation for the ISO Quality Standard towards
which AIS is working.

PRINTER Christopher Bacon (above), using 18th-century copper plates
and an original Victorian printing press, is making ''pulls'' of old
bank notes. He is in action at the ''Money Matters'' exhibition, which
opens today at the National Library of Scotland in Edinburgh, writes
CHRISTOPHER REEKIE.
Based on the history of the Bank of Scotland which celebrates its
tercentenary in July, the exhibition tells the story of Scottish banking
from 1695 to 1995. It also reflects the development of Scotland during
that period.
The growth of banking is shown from the existence side by side of
money and barter in 1700 to the electronic methods of today.
The Bank of Scotland, founded by an Act of the Scottish Parliament on
July 17, 1695, soon found itself in competition for the country's
banking business with the Darien Company, but survived the challenge
when the Darien scheme collapsed.
After 1707, it was suspected of being pro-Jacobite and against the
ruling House of Hanover, whose supporters founded the Royal Bank of
Scotland in 1727.
The focus of Scotland's economy shifted from the east coast to the
Clyde after 1750 because of the growth of trade with Virginia and the
West Indies.
A leading light in the west was Robin Carrick, known as ''Auld
Robin'', the managing partner of Glasgow's Ship Bank, whose shrewdness
can be heard on an amusing tape of his conversations with several
customers.
One impressive item is a ''whale back'' bank counter from Friockheim,
Angus, complete with a stern agent standing behind it.

SHARES in Kingfisher were boosted by news of a 5% rise in
like-for-like sales in its continuing businesses in the 13 weeks to
April 29. Within the group, Comet's like-for-like sales were up 5.1%,
while sales in Woolworths were 4.8% higher, writes NICOLA REEVES.
It benefited from a 7.5% increase in customer numbers which lifted
sales across all product categories especially toys, which recorded
double-figure percentage growth.
Kingfisher said that the UK electrical market remains highly
competitive with increased amounts of promotional spending. There is
considerable overcapacity in the market given cautious consumer spending
on discretionary items. Powerhouse, the loss-making retail business
owned by three of the privatised regional electricity companies, has
recently been put up for sale.
Kingfisher's other main trading formats, the DIY business B&amp;Q, French
electrical retailer Darty and Superdrug, all performed in line with
expectations during the quarter.
City analysts are increasingly starting to believe that Kingfisher may
be on the road to recovery. However, there is still a lot of work to be
done to achieve an adequate return on investment. Comet, the UK's
second-biggest electrical retailer, is expected to make a bigger loss at
the interim stage than last year, at around #10m.
Comet is in the midst of a restructuring exercise. This follows last
year's disastrous trading performance when it attempted to follow
arch-rival Dixons up market and in the process alienated many of its
core customers. At the same time it had operational problems which meant
that stock was not in the shops at the right time. In the process its
like-for-like sales dropped by 10.6%.
Commenting on the group's performance, chief executive Sir Geoffrey
Mulcahy said it was too soon to draw conclusions for the full year
because there was ''precious little evidence'' of any real return of
consumer confidence in the UK or France.
The trading update came as Kingfisher addressed its shareholders at
its annual general meeting. There was some anger at last year's decline
in profits, the first since the company's formation in 1982. Profits
fell by 9.4% to #281.5m. Some small shareholders drew attention to the
fact that at the same time the board was still being rewarded handsomely
with directors being paid #6m plus share options.
Chairman Sir Nigel Mobb's explanation that Sir Geoffrey's salary had
been cut from #1.3m to #949,000, reflecting the disappointing trading
performance, was greeted with laughter. The search continues for a new
chairman to replace Sir Nigel who stepped into the role temporarily in
February.
Kingfisher shares added 4p to 457p and are expected to make a gradual
recovery in the months ahead.

THE dollar was the centre of attention in the currency markets
yesterday with repeated intervention by a host of central banks.
The US Federal Reserve, Bundesbank, Bank of Japan, Bnak of England and
at least eight other central banks were involved. They succeeded in
pushing the dollar up against both the mark and the yen.
However, analysts are not convinced that the dollar will hold on to
its gains. The technical outlook for the currency is still negative.
Sterling took advantage of the weaker mark to add over two pfennigs,
closing in London at DM2.2446, but it lost out to the stronger dollar,
dropping over 1[1/4] cents to $1.5880. Sterling's value against a basket
of major trading currencies added 0.3 to 84.3.
Today sees publication of the UK Purchasing Managers' Index of
business activity for May but the City's attention is focused on next
Wednesday's monthly meeting between Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth
Clarke and Governor of the Bank of England Eddie George. Mr Clarke is
expected to hold out against a rise in UK base rates.

SCOTTISH Building Society celebrated the success of its prudent loan
policy yesterday at a time when the UK's main mortgage lenders are
wringing their hands over falling house prices, loan defaults and
repossessions.
Chairman Peter Brown told the society's annual general meeting in
Edinburgh that the value of new loans approved during the first five
months of this year had nearly trebled to #6.5m. Only 25% of these were
re-mortgages.
''The Scottish Building Society thrives from being a traditional
building society, delivering a simple but efficient service to all its
members,'' he said.
Scottish Building Society is a small player in the UK home loans
market. It made a post-tax profit of #1.06m during the financial year to
January 3 and had total assets of #108m. But at the end of that period
only two of its 3000 accounts were in intensive care.
He said the Scottish housing market was in better health than the rest
of the UK and this had helped business. ''In Scotland we at least have
the comfort of almost no negative equity, relatively modest average
loans and scope still for considerable growth in owner-occupation
compared to parts of England,'' Mr Brown said.

PROPERTY acquisitions totalling #434m in the previous financial year
helped push pre-tax profits ahead by 27% to #60.4m at MEPC.
Britain's second-largest property company saw net rental income jump
15.8% to #122m but there was a 12% rise in interest costs to #70.4m.
MEPC continues to capitalise or roll up interest on developments even
if the total was just #3m in the half-year to March but which does
undermine the quality of earnings in sharp contrast to industry leader
Land Securities.
Profits were helped by the sale of assets totalling #6.9m, a threefold
increase.
Encouragingly there has been a fall in bad-debt provisions. However,
there has been a deterioration in the occupancy rate with voids rising
since last September from 3.6% to 3.8% -- against the trend at LandSecs.
Chief executive James Tukey said that while conditions in the UK
market are still difficult, and occupier demand remains patchy, he has
noticed some modest rental value increases in good locations.
The interim dividend has been held at 5.25p.
The company is out of sequence with the vast majority of its peer
group in that its year end is in September rather than March. But it
does provide a useful mid-year indicator as to the state of the property
market where LandSecs pleasantly surprised the City with its uplift in
values last week from admittedly a very high-quality UK only portfolio.
A full-year maintained dividend of 20p is almost certain but it is
difficult to see any increase for quite some time as MEPC does need to
improve its dividend cover.
The shares closed at 403p where they yield 6.2%.

THE British Tourist Authority has launched a campaign to reduce VAT on
tourism to boost Britain as a destination for holidaymakers from both
the UK and abroad. I am particularly interested in the benefits that
reduced VAT would have on the tourism industry in the UK generally and
specifically in Scotland.
In this increasingly competitive industry Britain currently has the
second-highest tourism tax rate in Europe. As tourism is price-sensitive
and the UK is perceived as an expensive destination, I think it would be
extremely unwise to ignore this campaign.
Indeed, according to the World Tourism Organisation, since the mid
1980s Britain has suffered a greater fall in its balance of trade in
tourism than any other European Community member state.
A BTA study, carried out by Touche Ross, estimates that in just four
years the additional tourism activity stimulated by a reduction in VAT
to 8% on tourism accommodation alone would achieve the following:
* Create 38,000 new jobs.
* Reduce the balance of payments deficit on travel and tourism by
nearly #3 billion.
* Generate an extra #419 million in Treasury revenue.
The BTA report also says that when the Irish Government cut VAT on
meals and hotels from 23% to 10% in the mid 1980s, holiday tourism
doubled by 1990 and foreign exchange earnings rose by 50%. The move also
reversed Ireland's balance of trade deficit of IR#18m to a record
surplus of IR#300m by 1990.
Tourism industries in Greece, Portugal, and Spain, three fierce rivals
for British holidaymakers, have also been successful in reducing VAT
rates. Only Denmark, where the standard rate of VAT is 25%, is more
expensive in Europe than Britain.
In other countries, such as Austria and Belgium, where VAT is higher,
the Governments have granted special dispensation for holiday
accommodation, reducing the rates to 10% and 6% respectively.
Sir Rocco Forte, chairman of the Forte Group, is a keen supporter of
the campaign; he believes that Britain is hugely successful as a tourist
destination but the competition is becoming intense and we need to
strive for a level playing field.
There is no doubt in my mind that if VAT on tourism in the UK was
reduced, benefits would be passed on from businesses direct to
customers, resulting in cheaper holidays.
The key aspect of tourism is that customers are using disposable
income and, as a nation, we generally buy British and local products.
Therefore any increase in spend in the leisure industry would go
straight back into the UK economy and, more importantly, create jobs
locally.
The tourism industry is therefore calling upon the Chancellor of the
Exchequer to reduce VAT on tourism services in line with our European
competitors so that consumers can get better value for money from buying
British, and British taxpayers can benefit from an increase in the
overall tax yield from tourism.
Lower prices for customers would stimulate increased demand, leading
to increased sales and higher turnover. This in turn would generate
higher business profits and, therefore, increase the levels of
corporation tax paid to the Exchequer.
Tourism is labour intensive -- increased tourism activity would
generate extra jobs and thereby increase income tax and National
Insurance contributions, and thus help reduce the nation's social
security costs.
Scotland has so much to offer as a tourist destination -- history,
scenery, entertainment, heritage -- and our art galleries and museums
are second to none.
To sell Scotland effectively as a tourist destination, we need to
create holidays that are afforable and competitively priced.
If the Government cuts the VAT rate on tourism, I believe everyone
would be a winner. We would have more jobs, cheaper holidays, more tax
revenue, and a much healthier balance of payments.
David Barbour, general manager of Forte Crest Glasgow Airport Hotel,
was talking to Yvonne Wightman.

TWENTY-SIX years ago, ambitious young accountant Eric Hagman saw an
advertisement for a job with Arthur Andersen in The Herald.
At that time he had never heard of the company but was attracted by
the money on offer -- #1750 a year.
Today Arthur Andersen are one of the top five accountancy firms in
Scotland, and Eric Hagman is the managing partner responsible for the
firm's operations north of the border.
''I was one of twelve hired when the partners in America decided to
open a Scottish office. They had a Scottish partner in Rio de Janeiro
and they sent him to Scotland to start up the business.
''He hired us, but at first there was not a lot of work in Scotland,
and we were sent all over Europe wherever they needed extra hands,''
said Eric. Their globetrotting activities caused some jealousy among
other young accountants.
''A regular haunt for young accountants in those days was Danny's Bar,
and we would drop in there and describe how we had just come back from
Paris.''
Eric is still flying around the world on business for Arthur Andersen
but at a rather different level, and certainly not because of any lack
of work in this country. Arthur Andersen now has 360 offices throughout
the world.
He was recently part of the high-powered team of 90 appointed to look
at the company's worldwide strategy.
''We were divided into mini-task forces to look at specific subjects
and met in Berlin, Singapore, Paris, and Los Angeles,'' says Eric. ''It
took us a year to complete our statement.''
Despite his professional commitments, Eric manages to devote time to
the arts and is president of the Royal Glasgow Institute of Fine Arts
and a trustee of the National Gallery.
His interest in art is evident in Arthur Andersen's Glasgow office,
where some Scottish contemporary paintings are on display.
''We have a reasonable collection in our Glasgow and Edinburgh
offices,'' says Eric modestly. He was closely involved with the choice
of excellent works.

SO far as I know, no one from Nerd House is ever likely to be sent to
one of Mr Jack Black's two-day ''Mindstore'' personal development
sessions. But they sound very useful.
I once raised the subject tentatively with the Chairman. I came across
him in his PPS (personal parking space), momentarily at a disadvantage
as he fumbled through at least two-dozen pockets looking for his car
keys, a captive listener for once. The conversation went:
Him: ''Personal development? When I interviewed you for your present
post, whatever it is, you didn't tell me you required personal
development. I might have thought differently if you'd been quite frank
with me, my boy.'' (The only benefit in talking to the Chairman is that
he calls you a boy.)
Me: ''I simply want to enhance my performance for the benefit of Nerd
House. Also, Mr Black teaches us how to combat stress in our working
lives.
Him: ''Stress, eh? If you're working for me and you don't experience
stress, then there's something far wrong. And anyway, how much do these
courses cost?''
Me: ''#200 a head.''
Him: ''To which, I suppose, you must add your salary for the two lost
non-productive days. Although in your case, I don't suppose there's any
need to hire a locum. Look: you can go on one of these courses if you
pay for it yourself and take the two days from your holiday
entitlement.''
Me: ''Try your briefcase.''
Him: ''Eh what? Oh, I see.'' (Opens briefcase and finds car keys.)
''Well done, my boy. You will go far, and the further the better.''
So, as I said, nobody from Nerd House is ever likely to attend one of
Mr Jack Black's sessions. But I notice that the Glasgow guru is
currently enjoying a high profile, thanks to a television progrmame
tonight and an article in The Herald yesterday. All I've been able to do
is buy one of his books (#5.99 in paperback) and try to teach myself. I
was particularly impressed by the passage on ''Positive Affirmations'',
in which you tell yourself how wonderful you are at such length that you
eventually begin to believe it. Mr Black recommends starting with the
word ''I'' and ending with the word ''now'', putting a positive
statement in the middle. I tried out some of his examples on The Braces
last night at McSonachan's.
He said I was looking a bit thoughtful. I said: ''I am living a happy
healthy and prosperous life now.'' He said I must be kidding: was I
leaving Nerd House? I said: ''My financial matters are in perfect order
now.'' He said in that case, could he tap me for 20 quid? I said: ''I
know all my needs are perfectly met at all times now.'' He said that was
great: if I gave him the 20 quid he would buy the next round.
I'm not sure this was exactly the result Mr Black had in mind. But I
will persevere, no matter how much it costs.
* We have been cleft asunder by the news that the personable Ms Carol
Vorderman has been sacked from the BBC Tomorrow's World programme after
appearing in a commercial for Ariel detergent. Our own Nerd House
polymath, Ms Angelica Banana-Skyne, suggested at our coffee break that
this was another case of the BBC wanting to appear whiter than white,
but ending up with some persistent greyish stains.
I said: ''But surely, the BBC is trying to maintain the scientific
integrity of its programme. It's all a matter of impartiality.''
Angelica snorted -- although this is not a safe expression to use in
these drug-related times. She said there were two things we had to take
into account. One was that people loved watching television commercials
because they were often so clever: but that didn't mean they believed
them. The second was that if Ms Vorderman had declined to take part in
the commercial, people would no longer believe that she was a Cambridge
graduate known for mathematical wizardry. QED, said Angelica. We gave
her the point.

THE board of Ferguson shipbuilders is split over whether to accept a
#4.9m bid for the Port Glasgow yard by electrical wholesalers Holland
House because most shareholders would lose tax advantages by selling out
at this stage.
A source close to Ferguson management said the six-member board was
split down the middle over the Holland House bid of 406p per share which
was formalised on Tuesday.
The Glasgow-based company owned by 80-year-old millionaire Frank
Dunnet firmed up its offer following the withdrawal of rival bids by
Altnacraig Shipping, a firm owned by Ferguson chairman Sir Ross Belch,
and a management buyout team.
The Ferguson board said in a letter to shareholders that the terms of
the Holland House bid were ''fair and reasonable.'' But it noted that
''the net value to each individual could vary significantly'' and made
no recommendation.
Mr Dunnet, who is executive chairman of Holland House, acknowledged
the split in Ferguson's board, but said it was up to individual
shareholders to decide on the offer. ''I think they are all different
and they all have to make up their own minds,'' he told The Herald.
Most of Ferguson's 290 shareholders bought their shares at #1 each in
March 1991, since when they have not received any dividends. The Holland
House offer would allow many of them to quadruple their money in just
over four years.
But by selling their shares less than five years after they bought
them, Ferguson shareholders would lose tax relief on their original
investment granted under the terms of a Business Expansion Scheme.
Individuals making a profit of more than #6000 on the sale would also
be liable for capital gains tax.
An investor who put #10,000 into Ferguson four years ago might
therefore have to pay up to #16000 in tax on his #40,600 proceeds from
the sale.
Mr Dunnet acknowledged in his offer letter to Ferguson shareholders
that ''the timing may not be optimal for a number of shareholders who
have subscribed for their shares in Ferguson under the Business
Expansion Scheme.''
But he said it was necessary to settle the fate of the yard in time to
attract new orders before the government stops payouts by the
Shipbuilding Intervention Fund at the end of this year. The fund
subsidises 4.5% to 9.0% of the contract value of new orders.
Mr Dunnett said he would like stimulate a revival of shipbuilding on
the Clyde. ''I would like it to come back to what it used to be, to put
some money into it and put some confidence back into the workforce,'' he
told the Herald.
''I have always been interested in ships,'' Mr Dunnet said, adding
that he was not expecting the same kind of return from Ferguson as he
gets from his electrical stores and other investments in the west of
England and Canada.
But he said the present management team was doing ''a wonderful job''
and he wanted to keep in place.
Ferguson, which specialises in building small specialist ships, has a
strong order book which will keep its workforce of just under 300 fully
occupied well into 1996.
The yard is fitting out a car ferry for Caledonian MacBrayne and is
building two tugs for the Sullom Voe oil terminal in Shetland.
It has just started work on a car ferry for the Red Funnel Line, which
operates services to the Isle of Wight, and will lay the keel of an
offshore support vessel for the West of Shetland oilfields during the
summer.
''This will keep us going until late 1996. We won't need another order
until the autumn,'' Sir Ross said.
Ferguson made a pre-tax profit of #1.8m on the year to February 28 on
turnover of #14.6m and Sir Ross said he expected another ''very
satisfactory result'' this year, although it would be difficult to
improve further on the profit figure.
Justifying the company's failure to pay a dividend for the past four
years, he said: ''We found it was prudent to hold back while we were
undertaking further investment, so we decided not to pay a dividend
until the end of the Business Expansion Scheme period.''

LICENSING involves two-way traffic and is a growing invisible export,
according to Norman Trotter, managing partner of The Licensing Centre.
Scottish companies can, says Norman, use a license agreement for their
own products as a means of breaking into new export markets, or can
manufacture another company's product as a means of leapfrogging
technology.
''Licensing your own product is a very low-risk way to export as you
are dealing with someone who knows their market intimately. It is also a
way of leapfrogging technology as you do not have to design the goods
from scratch,'' says Norman.
The managing partner of The Licensing Centre should know what he is
talking about as he has spent a lifetime in engineering with Ferranti
and Honeywell.
Among the responsibilities he held at Honeywell were those of director
of production for 12 years and administration director for five years,
as well as being responsible for the company's business and licence
development -- negotiating and managing licences throughout the UK and
Eastern/Western Europe.
''Licensing offers an economy great opportunities. People often forget
that this is how Japan rose to become such an economic power. They
started by manufacturing goods under licenses from other countries and
now their technology is so advanced that other countries are operating
under license from Japanese companies,'' says Norman.
The Licensing Centre is helping more Scottish companies than ever to
take advantage of license agreements to bring in revenue from overseas
markets.
The rewards can be high, with the average agreement yielding between
seven and 12% according to Norman. But he points out: ''It could be as
high as 25% if you are talking about an expensive low-volume piece of
machinery and below 5%, if the goods involved are low-cost high
volume.''
The engineer agrees that there is a danger of companies squandering
the income received from a license instead of using it to develop new
generations of their equipment so that they stay ahead of their
competitors.
To escape from involved negotiations surrounding technology transfer
Norman retreats to his workshop when he is at home rebuilding old
motorbikes.
He has recently completed a 1954 Ariel Red Hunter and has now started
to build from scratch a 350cc Competition BSA.
''I don't ride them once I have finished,'' explains Norman. ''I just
get a kick out of building them.''

THE Murray Emerging Economies Trust was savaged by the crash on Latin
American stock markets immediately after its launch in December, but the
damage could have been worse, writes ROBERT POWELL.
The Mexican and Argentine assets of the trust suffered a #5.9m
depreciation between the launch on December 7 and April 30, leading to a
9.8% decline in net asset value to #46.8m.
Fortunately fund managers Murray Johnstone had invested only 29% of
the trust's capital before the Mexican peso crisis triggered a financial
crisis throughout Latin America.
The remaining trust funds were invested more cautiously and a healthy
balance was kept in UK gilts. The trust, therefore, managed to
outperform a 21.4% fall in its benchmark IFC Investible Index over the
five-month period.
At the end of April, 47.3% of its net assets were invested in Asian
equities. A further 23.9% were tied up in Latin America and 21.4% in
Europe, while 7.4% were invested in South Africa where the trust remains
underweight.
The remaining 29% of funds were invested in UK gilts.
Earnings per share were 1.25p, but there was no interim dividend.
Murray Johnstone said Asia remained a ''growth powerhouse'' and
developing markets in Europe continued to provide ''attractive
opportunities.''
But the fund managers said growth prospects in Latin America had
''deteriorated significantly''and they expressed ''a degree of caution''
over South Africa.
Fund manager Euan Matheson said the funds still tied up in UK gilts
would be gradually invested in emerging markets in a similar proportion
to investments already made.
The trust plans to invest strongly in Malaysia, which will eventually
account for 14% of its portfolio, and to a lesser extent in China,
India, and the Philippines, he said.

DRACONIAN action is already beginning to pay off to a very slight
degree at Dawson International although progress this year will very
much depend upon consumer markets.
The textile company which suffered an overdue trauma with the
boardroom coup in March that resulted in the departure of chairman Sir
Ronald Miller and managing director Nick Kuenssberg -- paradoxically the
longest-serving non-executive director of ScottishPower -- saw profits
in the year to March swing from a provision-laden #98m loss into a small
#1.7m stated pre-tax profit. As promised two months ago, the dividend
total has been held at 3p.
However, Dawson is best looked at from the basis of the on-going
business before exceptional items. These resulted in operating profits
falling 18% to #35.7m on turnover 2% better at #328m.
As managing director Peter Forrest said, concentration is inevitably
on Pringle which is by far the highest profile part of the group, partly
because of its Scottishness and the fact that it employs 1200 out of the
4500 employees in the country.
Pringle accounts for a sixth of the total business. It was hit
particularly in the second half of the year for the now well-known
reasons of the mild European winter and general retail depression --
particularly in the important German market. It was also over extended
in many of the new brand lines into accessories without adequate market
research and support.
As already known, the unbranded products Arbroath factory closes next
month while there are also redundancies in Hawick.
Pringle's problem after losing #5m of operating profits is that it
probably is more exposed to the weakness of low retail demand in
international markets than almost any other Dawson activity.
Elsewhere performance has been mixed with Joseph Dawson woolcombing
and cashmere working full out as are Dawson fur fabrics which are doing
particularly well in eastern Europe.
One reassuring point is that while cashmere prices have doubled over
the last 18 months, they now appear to have stabilised. And, as
important, Dawson no longer has any serious worries on the supply side
with Iranian and Afghan wools backing up the more more widespread
supplies coming out of China now that the provinces are becoming ever
more decentralised.
The albatross of the US shower curtain business has finally
disappeared with a $37m payment arriving yesterday from buyer Spring
Industries. That not only releases a substantial amount of hitherto
wasted management time but also reduces debt which at the year-end was
equivalent to a comfortable gearing of 27%.
The financial prospect is for current year ''clean'' profits without
exceptionals to emerge at around #27m which would leave the shares, at
119p, trading at 13 times earnings and allow some restoration in the
dividend.
But there are more fundamental matters such as the appointment of a
new chief executive -- an area where Dawson in recent years has been
somewhat unsuccessful, not necessarily because of the personal qualities
of the individuals but that they were the wrong choice for the position.
Happily the management structure is now such that a quick choice is not
necessary.
There is also a need for another non-executive director. Perhaps a
more forceful personality on the board among the non-executives could
have brought matters to a head over a year ago rather than having to
rely on institutional discontent at a share price dropping as low as 90p
creating the crisis.
Strategically, the company should have a significant role to play in
the rationalisation of the UK textile industry even if it does see its
progress being to a substantial degree overseas through joint ventures
in the Far East and elsewhere.

LINDSAY Plant, the Kilmarnock-based excavation plant hire specialist
which claims to be the biggest of its kind in Scotland, has been sold
for #8m by the two brothers who founded it in 1966.
The management buy-in deal, backed by Royal Bank Development Capital's
Glasgow office, is being fronted by Paul Garvey, until recently managing
director of Alexander Ross Holdings, the Carronshore-based maker of fine
soaps and distributor of janitorial supplies.
There is also a management buy-out element to the Lindsay sale, with
three established senior Lindsay staff -- depot manager Robert Taylor,
plant manager Gerry Millar and company secretary Margaret Dempster --
all joining Garvey in taking a personal stake in the business.
Brothers George and Jim Lindsay are each retaining a 2.5% equity stake
but, at the ages of 50 and 53 respectively, are realising most of their
interest in the business. George Lindsay, the corporate driving force
behind the group for nearly three decades, becomes part-time chairman
and will work closely with Garvey to expand the business. Brother Jim
will retain a significant role on the service side of the operations.
Garvey, a 42-year-old Irishman who in 1983 was finance director and
one of the team who took Glasgow-based PCT Group to a market listing,
says a stock market listing for Lindsay is one of his goals in the
medium term.
Lindsay, which operates a fleet of 170 excavators and dozers on sites
right across central Scotland, will have a turnover of just under #8m in
the current year, which ends this month. Profits are undisclosed but are
said to be very healthy in a sector where margins are notoriously thin.
Assets, at cost, total some #9m.
George Lindsay says the deal, which is worth more than #10m in total
when leasing elements and resources for expansion are included, offers
the group an exciting future. ''After nearly thirty years building it,
we wanted to see this company go to a good home but retain its own
identity. Who knows what it might grow into in another five years
time.''
One of the new team's priorities will be geographical expansion, based
on Lindsay's strong reputation for quality service. Most of the 200
people on the Lindsay payroll are skilled operators for every piece of
equipment hired.
The sale, which was handled for the Lindsay brothers by Arthur
Andersen's Glasgow office, attracted interest, and latterly two rival
offers, from other plant hire companies.

RODIME, the Scottish-based computer software company, suffered further
losses in the half year to March as litigation to protect its patent
rights in the United States dragged on.
The company, which is based in Edinburgh but does most of its business
in the United States reported a pre-tax loss of $2.0m, down from $5.3m
previously.
Rodime has had virtually no income since it signed its last licencing
agreement for producing computer disk drives in late 1993. The reduced
losses merely reflect a cut in administration and legal costs.
Rodime has spent millions of dollars on legal action in the United
States over the last five years to prevent the alleged infringement of
its patents by competitors.
A resumption of income through the signing of further licencing
agreements depends on the outcome of two test cases against the firms
Quantum and Seagate, but these have not yet come to trial.
''Much of the industry is queuing up behind these rulings,'' said
Rodime director David Mathewson.
In the meantime, Rodime is living off bank loans. The company has just
negotiated a fresh extension of its revolving credit facilities.
''This allows us to run our way through the next 12-month period as
far as working capital is concerned,'' Mr Mathewson said. He declined to
give further details.
A pre-trial conference in the Seagate law suit is scheduled to take
place on July 17, but it has been repeatedly put off and Mr Mathewson
said it could suffer further postponement.
''We are moving into a phase of increased activity now, but we cannot
give any guarantee of when the trial date will be,'' he said.
Rodime originally made disk drives at its own factories in Glenrothes,
Florida, and Singapore, but since 1991 its income has come solely from
licencing other manufacturers to produce them.

EXCLUSIVE
THE former management of a West Midlands-based land consultant's
Scottish arm today begin trading independently, after the parent company
turned down their bid to buy out its operations north of the Border.
Geologist David Mason, former managing director of Johnson Poole &amp;
Bloomer (Scotland), and fellow former director and mineral surveyor John
Evans have established the Mason Evans Partnership.
Both men played an integral part in establishing Johnson Poole &amp;
Bloomer's Glasgow office 11 years ago.
Their independent geotechnical, mining and environmental consultancy
will be in direct competition with their former employer for major
business from the likes of housebuilders, local enterprise companies and
mining groups.
Mr Mason, a Glasgow University geology graduate, said: ''When they
declined the management buy-out, it wasn't a great disappointment
because we saw great opportunities for this wholly independent practice.
''We aim and fully expect to be the most prominent independent
Scottish consultancy of our type within a very short period.''
Explaining his company's decision to reject the recent management
buy-out proposal, Gordon Wood, a director of Johnson Poole &amp; Bloomer,
said the Scottish office, one of three, was a strategic operation which
his company wished to develop.
He conceded that there might have been a price which the West Midlands
company would have considered but said it would have been a much higher
price than that which was offered.
The former company secretary of Johnson Poole &amp; Bloomer (Scotland),
Maureen MacKay, and geotechnical manager Niall Lawless have also joined
the Mason Evans Partnership.
The independent consultancy starts with a team of seven but expects to
double its staff within its first year.
Mr Evans has expertise in the recovery of sand, gravel, coal, and
other minerals, while Mr Mason's speciality is assessing the suitability
of land for development.
He has experience of solving the problems which contaminated land and
abandoned mine-workings -- particularly prevalent in former strongholds
of heavy industry such as Lanarkshire -- can pose for potential
developers.
During their employment with Johnson Poole &amp; Bloomer, the breakaway
team was involved in a number of prestigious projects, such as the
stabilisation of the main stand at Celtic Park about seven years ago
and, more recently, the development of the Eurofreight terminal at
Mossend, Lanarkshire.
Meanwhile, Johnson Poole &amp; Bloomer has just appointed Alistaire
Gilchrist, a former head of land renewal at the Scottish Development
Agency, as business development manager.
Mr Wood said another two senior appointments were in the pipeline.

A new company called Scotsafe said yesterday it had secured #4.5m to
build and operate a plant in Arbroath that will process clinical waste
from Scottish hospitals more safely than conventional incinerators.
Scotsafe director George Weir said the venture capital firm 3i had
contributed #1m in equity to the firm, whose other main shareholders are
the US company Biomed and and Scotsafe's Scottish directors.
The financing package comprised a mixture of new equity and loans from
the Royal Bank of Scotland, he said, declining to give further details.
Last December, Scotsafe signed a signed a 10-year contract with a
consortium of 11 Scottish hospital trusts to process 5000 tonnes of
clinical waste per year at the Arbroath plant, which will start working
in the Autumn.
This initial contract is worth #10m and Mr Weir said Scotsafe hopes to
sign more soon with hospitals elsewhere in the UK and Ireland.
Most are looking for new methods of clinical waste disposal because
their present incinerators do not meet tighter European Union pollution
control standards that come into force on October 1.
''We have tendered for a number of contracts in the UK and we should
be informed about the outcome of one of them next week,'' Mr Weir said.
Scotsafe uses a method called Continuous Feed Augur, developed by
Biomed in the United States, grind and sterilise used syringes, bandages
and other hospital waste without hazardous emmissions.

SCOTTISH communications group Tayburn, which designs corporate
literature and organises exhibitions, has taken over its smaller rival
McIlroy Coates for an undisclosed sum.
The enlarged Edinburgh-based company will employ about 80 people and
generate a turnover of #7m. It also has offices in Glasgow and Aberdeen.
The merger marks a return to partnership between Tayburn chief
executive Erick Davidson and McIlroy Coates's managing director Andrew
Hunter who becomes creative director at Tayburn.
The two men co-founded Tayburn in 1979, but went separate ways when Mr
Hunter left to set up McIlroy Coates in 1987.

EUROTUNNEL yesterday damped down fears that it will need to raise more
money through another rights issue.
Co-chairman Sir Alastair Morton said there were ''no intentions'' to
raise additional equity to save the Channel tunnel company.
However, at yesterday's annual meeting he emphsised the importance of
reducing debts and interest charges at the #10bn project.
Debt service costs, at around #800m a year, could be reduced following
reduction in interest rates after discussions with banks, or as a result
of railway arbitration.

BRITISH Aerospace has wasted little time in firing its first salvo in
the resumed battle for control of Trident submarine maker VSEL.
It is offering the same share terms as it was doing last December
before its offer was referred along with at of rival bidder GEC to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
These are 3.3 BAe shares for each VSEL which values the
Barrow-on-Furness company at 1729p, or a total of #670m. That represents
an increase of 250p on the original offer because of the strength of the
BAe share price in recent weeks.
Market reaction was to mark VSEL up just 4p to 1790p as the bid was
bang in line with expectations with BAe down 6p at 524p while GEC were
2[1/2]p better at 320p. There is a cash alternative of 1600p.
BAe says that the acquisition will enhance its capabilities as one of
the world's leading exporters of defence systems by the addition of a
range of naval platforms to BAe's existing portfolio of air and land
systems. It would also help in winning additional export orders for VSEL
by using BAe's skills in international markets.
VSEL predictably asked shareholders to do nothing in the light of the
possibility of a counter offer from GEC.
The bid looks a reasonably full one at first sight, valuing VSEL at 17
times last year's earnings. However one of the conspicuous attractions
is that VSEL has disclosed cash reserves of #411m which would go a
considerable way towards offsetting the cost of the bid.

A MAJOR development that will more than double the capacity of
Scotland's newest ski area adjacent to Ben Nevis at Aonach Mor, near
Fort William, has been announced.
Work is due to start soon to open up skiing on the more sheltered
north-eastern side of the mountain by this winter, providing sport for
engineers and advanced skiers.
Ian Sykes, managing director of Nevis Range, the company who runs
skiing at Aonach Mor, explained that 50% of customers were beginners,
but that snow cover on ground suitable for them had not been good in the
existing Snowgoose bowl, opened for commercial skiing in 1989.
''Four years ago I approached the board and said that if we were going
to fight our corner in the market, we just had to do something about
it.''
The new area is not only protected from the wind, it holds snow for
longer and combines low-angled beginner slopes with much steeper ground
for experienced skiers.
''It will give a kind of skiing that doesn't exist anywhere else in
Scotland, with the possible exception of Glen Coe,'' Mr Sykes said.
Nevis Range was developed at a cost of #9.5m with the intention of
expanding recreational facilities in the area to provide jobs and income
as an addition to summer tourism. An access road to the bottom gondola
station, financed by Highland Regional Council, was constructed in 1992
at a further cost of #3.1m.

A CONVERSATION with Martyn Bennett touches on many topics. Whether or
not all horses trot in 6/8 time; the rhythmic and melodic similarities
between indigenous musics from far-off lands; how being a folk musician
is, against the odds, quite hip these days.
Bennett is a 24-year-old violin-player and piper, born in Newfoundland
and mostly raised in Kingussie. At the time of hisbirth, his academic
Scottish parents were both working in Canada. His mum was, in fact,
studying the influence of Gaelic emigrants on Newfoundland's native Mic
Mac tribe. So maybe it's no surprise that Bennett is motivated by a
spirit of pan-Caledonian cross-fertilisation.
His curriculum vitae starts by describing itself as a brief one, but
then goes on to fill seven, closely-typed pages. Martyn Bennett has
crammed a lot of musical activity into his life, you see. Here are some
selected news-highlights.
He studied classical violin at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and
Drama, graduating in 1993. Last summer he toured the American west coast
with folk-rockers Wolfstone. He has recorded with ambient-Celtic-house
merchants Mouth Music, and also featured on the music for the well-kent
TV ad for Drambuie, crafted by Mouth Music's Martin Swan.
Bennett's piping once welcomed Tanzanian President Julius Nyrere to
Edinburgh. In Auld Reekie at Hogmanay, his bare-chested fiddling warmed
80,000 revellers in Princes Street, and he scored Tom McGrath's
stage-adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson's Kidnapped at Edinburgh's
Lyceum Theatre.
He is at present involved with the theatre again which, in a
roundabout way, is why he is sure that all horses trot in 6/8. He has
composed the music for the Traverse's production of David Harrower's
Knives In Hens, opening at the Traverse tomorrow prior to a tour of the
Highlands and Islands.
Horses don't feature directly in the play's three-strong cast, but
they do figure in Bennett's music, which he will be performing on
violin, flute, viola and keyboard throughout the play's run. ''There are
two parts to the music. I draw upon a folk element because the play is
about rural tradition to an extent.
''But the play also has a sinister element, so I've sampled a lot of
ambient, organic sounds from a range of sources and looped them. The
wind blowing through a creaking tree. The jingling of horses' yokes . .
. I went out with a DAT and recorded a lot of horses, and they all seem
to trot at the same tempo.
''A lot of the play's action takes place in a mill, so I've tried to
create the notion of industrial sound with a sense of antiquity to it.
And the play's three characters -- the miller, the ploughman, and the
ploughman's wife -- are all closely integrated, so I've tried to
establish musical themes for each of them. I've linked the miller to the
viola, the ploughman to the violin, and the wife to the flute.
''I've not created a score as such, as I did for Kidnapped, because I
think it's anathema to live theatre . . . if you're controlling what the
actors are doing creatively.''
Of late, Bennett's creative processes have been taken up by his own
album, mb, recorded for an Edinburgh label and currently being
considered as a licensing proposition by a couple of major London
labels. ''I'm not an expert on hip hop or progressive house, but what
I've done is a hard progressive house LP.''
He has also written a sextet for the Edinburgh Quartet. ''I've added
smallpipes and flute, which is me, and Tom Bancroft on percussion, and
taken some traditional tunes and really screwed them up -- which might
be the wrong way of putting it.''
Bennett also plays live in Edinburgh every second Sunday afternoon at
the Basement in Broughton Street in Salsa Celtica. ''It's the baby of
Chilean guitarist Gallo Ceron. Gallo always says: ''Sure this is salsa
music . . . salsa is a sauce with everything in it . . . and this is a
Scottish salsa, even though it's Latin.''
Internationally indigenous: it's a good way to be.

PEACE broke out at Parkhead yesterday after a weekend fraught with
rumour and counter rumour which threatened to send the club into the bad
old days of boardroom rows and power struggles, with the team manager
stuck in the middle.
Tommy Burns, who instigated the furore by announcing his
dissatisfaction with the way the club was being run 24 hours after the
team's victory in the Tennents Scottish Cup final, and the managing
director, Fergus McCann, yesterday agreed to put the row behind them and
go forward for the good of the club.
The reconciliation came after the manager had been called to explain
his remarks after the final, when he talked of ''needing to be trusted
by the people who employ me,'' but there was a long discussion before
the consensus was reached that will please fans of the club, many of
whom were astonished that, on the back of their first success for six
years, Celtic again were making the wrong kind of headlines.
Burns took an enormous gamble in standing up for what he considered
were essential principles of management, and came as close as is
possible to losing the job he had taken a year ago amid controversial
circumstances which also involved the managing director's unusual style
of doing things. He did so with the cup in the cupboard, and perhaps
that made the difference between the decision yesterday and what would
have happened otherwise.
Burns apologised to the board for any suggestion that there was a
power struggle, and he added: ''My aim was to highlight the need for
discussion, but if I have caused consternation among the board of
directors or the supporters, they have my sincere apologies.''
Even if he undoubtedly endured a hard time during what were described
as ''open and frank'' talks, Burns did not directly apologise for
espousing the ground rules he felt are required to manage a team
properly. However, he did say after it was all over: ''I feel a lot more
at ease with the situation regarding my responsibilities as manager, and
I am saddened that these events should in any way diminish what has been
a memorable time for the fans.''
Burns insisted that the row had not been indicative of a power
struggle and finished his part of the statement by saying: ''Fergus
brought me to Celtic as manager and now we owe it to each other, and to
everyone connected with Celtic, to work together to ensure that the club
brings the success our supporters deserve.''
I understand that, as a result of the talks during which the views
were expressed strongly, there will soon be a change in operation of the
different functions, which will mean that Burns will be able to use two
''football'' minded directors as a buffer between that department and
the ''financial'' men, headed by McCann, who are now overseeing the
club's business.
The managing director did not use the club statement to offer his
version of events, but, after having pointed out that Burns had taken
the club back to Europe as well as winning the cup, he said: ''With the
right guidance, support, and resources, I am sure that Tommy can take
the club on to be even stronger, with greater achievements. It should
not be forgotten that it is 11 years since since Celtic have been in two
cup finals in one season, and six years since a trophy has been won.
''Tommy and I can work together and the mutual understanding displayed
today demonstrated to the board that we all have the same goal for a
successful Celtic Football Club.''
He went on to say that the manager and all the directors agreed that
the overall management of the club has to be conducted in an ''organised
and structured way for the benefit of the shareholders, most of whom are
supporters like me, to whom on-field success and responsible financial
management are equally important.''
The final paragraph left no doubt that there was only one side
apologising for any failings. ''The board unanimously accept Tommy's
apology for the consternation caused to the board and supporters, and we
look forward to giving him our full support . . .''

JIM Glass, the man who almost certainly will become the third leader
of Hearts inside 14 months, yesterday dismissed any suggestions that
Wallace Mercer will be involved in his #4m bid to take over the
Tynecastle club, writes Ian Paul.
Glass, a wealthy retired property developer, has had his first contact
with the current chairman, Chris Robinson, and the two will meet within
a few days to discuss the new investor's plans.
There has been speculation, supported by Robinson, that Mercer was
linked with Glass in the proposal that would give an initial #2m to the
club to buy players, but the chairman will be assured that this is not
the case. Glass said: ''Wallace has said he wants out of football, and
he does not figure in my plans for the club.''
The prominent Edinburgh businessman, and leading Scottish racehorse
owner, faxed Robinson with his proposal yesterday and the chairman
replied by phone. That is the first time the two have spoken, although
Glass has talked to vice-chairman Leslie Deans but, contrary to
indications that there would be friction, Glass reported all was
amicable.
Robinson, owner of Wheatsheaf Catering, bought the major shareholding
in the club, along with lawyer Deans, from Mercer a year ago and has
been scathing in his criticism of the man who gave the club a high
profile for 13 years. This week he said that fans had been phoning to
say that he should have no part of any deal involving the former
chairman.
However, Mercer retains 25% of the club and the #1m he left as a
guarantee with the bank is up for review about now.
His connection may not be as heavy, but it remains important. As Glass
put it yesterday: ''Clearly, as a major shareholder, Wallace Mercer has
an interest in what lies ahead for the club.''
Glass's initial #2m offer will be followed by a similar sum soon
afterwards, but the long-termplan includes an issue with full voting
shares.
Hearts held a share issue earlier in the season, but that one was not
for voting shares, which proved a desperate disappointment, raising only
#300,000, and although the team managed to escape the threat of
relegation, only just, the financial status of the Tynecastle club, with
its stadium commitments, is not good.
They are #4m in debt and manager Tommy McLean, who was appointed by
Robinson a year ago, has made it clear that he does not intend to carry
on trying to lift the club's fortunes with bargain basement players.
Mercer, who has been in Scotland on a business trip from his home in
Cannes, but was on his way back last night, is staying out of the
debate, but there is no doubt that he still takes a keen interest in the
club which he bought for #350,000 14 years ago.
The Hearts Shareholders' Association met last night to discuss the new
situation, but will wait until they speak to Glass before they make any
decisions as to their stance. Said chairman Alex Knight: ''We have read
everything about the bid, but we will need answers from Mr Glass before
we can form any view.''

ENGLAND'S World Cup plans are being disrupted by injuries -- including
a worrying knock for kicking hero Rob Andrew.
Andrew faces a race against time to shake off a dead leg before
Sunday's final pool B encounter with fellow quarter-finalists Western
Samoa in Durban.
England, led by Andrew in the absence of Will Carling in last night's
27-20 win over Italy, also have doubts over centre Jeremy Guscott and
winger Rory Underwood.
Meanwhile, hooker Keith Wood became the second Ireland player to be
ruled out of the World Cup, after dislocating his right shoulder in the
50-28 pool C victory over Japan.
Wood, who was injured after only eight minutes, will be replaced by
Shane Byrne.
Byrne was also called up as a replacement on Ireland's tour of
Australia last year, but has yet to win a cap.

LIKE most people who are employed, rather than employ, Tommy Burns
discovered yesterday that the boss is the guy with the greenbacks, and
due attention to his requirements has to be paid.
From one point of view, the Celtic manager might have chosen the right
moment, a day after the club's first triumph in six years, when he
decided to vent his annoyance at the way Fergus McCann runs the Parkhead
show, but he still had to accept the eternal verity that the man who
pays the piper calls the tune.
When he made his public revelations of the difficulties of working
with McCann, Burns upset more than just the man who became a cult hero
when he sent the old board packing.
There were a lot of fans, to whom Burns was -- and remains -- an idol,
who were unhappy that he picked the day after their chance to hold
long-awaited celebrations to highlight differences between himself and
the managing director.
Even on the board and among prominent shareholders, where he has solid
and important support, Burns' outburst caused some disappointment. As
someone who had not been a part of the ''Sack The Board'' saga, it might
be that Tommy had not fully appreciated the ringing of old alarm bells
that the controversy he stirred would cause. He knows now.
The manager may have been due some criticism for the timing of his
words and there are others who believe he should not have made them
public at all. But if they have brought about a better understanding of
the job he is trying to do, that could be worthwhile in the long run for
Celtic.
In highlighting the problems he faced, Burns was aware that the
Scottish Cup being stored safely in the cupboard was an ace that could
not seriously be trumped at this moment, although it was still a big
gamble. He has had to retract some of what he did in a public statement
and, in that context, he might have learned some things he had not
appreciated in his short life as a manager.
Celtic fans will hope also that McCann also has been taught a few
things about football that are very different from the business world.
The most important lesson, however, is that the two men have to get it
together. Celtic and their supporters need another battle for supremacy
like Hoover needs a new free-flight promotion.

AYR'S new weighing-room, complete with up-to-date facilities for
jockeys, trainers, and officials, will be used for the first time this
evening at the start of the three-day meeting.
The new building at the far side of the paddock replaces the old
weighing-room under the stands, which is to be demolished immediately
after this meeting and replaced by an extension to the members' stand.
Due to be completed in January, it will provide sponsors' rooms and
hospitality boxes on the top two floors and improved facilities for
members.
Mark Kershaw, Ayr's general manager explained that the three-day
meeting had been introduced in the hope of encouraging more runners from
southern stables.
Although Newmarket and Lambourn are represented, the card is mainly
dominated by northern stables. Jack Berry, who names Ayr as his
favourite track, has four runners.
Pekay, third last time out, will be expected to show improvement in
the Pickwick Hotel Maiden Stakes, but Mark Johnston's stable is in form
and his newcomer Double Oscar is expected to win.
Berry, who seldom leaves an Ayr meeting empty handed, could be
successful with Flashing Sabre in the Annfield Hotel Maiden handicap and
Monkey Wench in the Burns Monument Hotel Claiming Stakes.

GREATEST can show the effectiveness of front-running tactics at
Brighton with success today in the Flanagan and Allen Handicap.
Racing from the front is often called ''doing it the hard way'' or
''doing the donkey work.''
But it is a shrewd tactic at Brighton where the sharp bends and steep
gradients make coming from behind no easy task.
Which suggests that Greatest will take some beating.
A change to pacemaking produced a quick return for the four-year-old
at Lingfield in March when he made most to land a claimer, though he was
quickly swallowed up on softish ground on the stiffer track at
Folkestone later in the month.
He showed he remains in good heart when narrowly beaten at Salisbury
last time, running on strongly to draw well clear of the remainder of a
big field.
His shrewd trainer, Reg Akehurst, excels in his placing of
handicappers and looks to have found the gelding an ideal opportunity to
resume winning ways.

Mashonaland Districts 13, Scotland XV 42.
INSPIRED perhaps by the senior side's win over Tonga, the Scotland
Development XV opened their Zimbabwean tour with an eventually stylish
success over Country Districts.
Yet for all that the result represented an encouraging start, the
Scots took some 58 minutes before eroding their hosts' early lead.
Stuart Laing was the Scots only first-half points contributor with one
penalty in reply to a try by Gary O'Neil, converted by Steve Rugg who
also kicked two penalties. Laing's two penalties after the interval
represented the turnaround.
The Scots' try procession was triggered by full back Mike Dods, from
John Kerr's kick ahead.
Brian Renwick, the Hawick No.8, continued the tourists' offensive by
taking an inside pass from Gilmour to score.
A cheeky try by Kevin Troup pirating ball at the base of the scrum
followed before Murray Craig sliced through for a solo try. Scotland's
final scoring act was a try by Gilmour. Scotland's other points came
from Laing's four conversions.

Ireland 50, Japan 28
IRELAND resurrected their challenge for a place in the World Cup
quarter-finals, but were made to battle by a determined Japanese side.
The Irish got off to a flying start through tries from flanker David
Corkery, lock Neil Francis and left-wing Simon Geoghegan. But Japan
struck back with some imaginative rugby.
Hiroyuki Kajihara was surprisingly denied a try by referee Stef
Neethling after seemingly touching down but fellow flanker Sinali Latu
crashed over just after.
Three minutes later, Ko Izawa ran in for the second after another fine
break from Sinali Latu. And with left wing Yoshihito Yoshida converting
both scores, Japan had cut back Ireland's lead at the break to 19-14.
The second-half was just as fiercely contested as Ireland were twice
awarded penalty tries when the Japanese collapsed the scrum. Flanker
Eddie Halvey and scrum-half Niall Hogan also crossed the line, with
Burke kicking six conversions and a penalty.
But the Japanese were also rewarded for their enterprise with
converted tries from fly-half Hirao and prop Takura.

From South Africa
SCOTT Hastings has forced his way back into prime spot in the fiercely
competitive struggle for supremacy in the Scottish midfield and he will
play in the crucial Rugby World Cup encounter against France on
Saturday.
The rivalry for the two centre berths has been more intense than in
many a long season -- a healthy state of affairs the selectors dearly
wish was the case elsewhere in the side -- with Hastings, Ian Jardine,
Tony Stanger and Graham Shiel all having something special to offer.
On Saturday at the Loftus Versfeld Stadium in Pretoria, Hastings will
be partnered by Graham Shiel, who has more than looked the part since
coming into the side against Romania in place of the injured Gregor
Townsend.
Shiel has grabbed his chance with both hands, playing exceptionally
well against Ivory Coast last week when partnered by Stanger.
Hastings and Ian Jardine played together against Tonga on Tuesday and
the selectors have reckoned that, well though he played, Jardine
requires more rugby under his belt since recovery from the bad facial
damage sustained againt France in February.
Stanger, who decided he no longer wished to play on the wing for
Scotland, has done incredibly well to re-invent himself as an
international centre and, like Jardine, will be disappointed not to get
the nod.
For Hastings, selection represents fulsome reward for the dogged
determination displayed when losing his place after the South African
defeat last winter.
Team manager Duncan Paterson said: ''There was a debate about several
positions but, as I've said all along, the centre is where people have
been challenging very closely and there will be one or two disappointed
obviously.
''We are playing France in a very important game and this is our
front-line side,'' said Patterson, who declined to elaborate on whether
the selection of Shiel indicated the Scots would play a more expansive
game.
The French have not been overly impressive in this World Cup so far,
but Patterson said he was not being taken in by that.
''I wouldn't let that fool anybody. Probably the French have been a
bit like ourselves in that these two games had to be got out of the way
and we are into the real stuff now.''

Australia 27, Canada 11
BOB Dwyer, the Australian coach, launched a scathing attack on the
standard of refereeing at the World Cup after his side stuttered to
victory over Canada in Port Elizabeth yesterday.
''It's just too inconsistent. Today, the first bit of lifting in the
lineout was penalised,'' he said. ''But I've seen a picture of a South
African whose shorts were above his prop's head in yesterday's match.
''As well as that we are not being allowed to ruck as we want to. Some
of the games are being ruined by players lying on the ball, and we were
told we could ruck, but Phil Kearns was penalised for rucking. Something
has to be done.''
Pre-match entertainment was enlivened by the irrepressible David
Campese. His latest outpouring is about England in general, and Will
Carling in particular. ''This England side is a team which prays for
sunshine but which carries an umbrella,'' said the Aussie winger.
''Carling, himself, epitomises England's lack of skill. He has speed and
bulk, but plays like a castrated bull.''
Mind you, Campese may have forgotten that it was Australia playing
like wounded animals, quite literally with their injury list, in their
first match since having lost to South Africa in the opening game, and
despite having licked their wounds and winning, the Aussies were far
from looking like a well-oiled machine.
Australia had a 14-point advantage at half-time thanks to tries from
Ilie Tabua and Joe Roff, Michael Lynagh making up the 20 points with two
penalties and two conversions. Gareth Rees banged over two penalties for
the Canadians for their six points.
The odd moment of David Campese brilliance, and some dogged work in
the centre from Tim Horan were all the 1991 champions had to show in
defence of their crown, while the Canadians, with Al Charron in the
driving seat, and backs who could spread panic, had the Aussies rattled
and played with a willingness to take part in hand-to-hand combat.
It was one try apiece after the break, Lynagh going over following
good work from Campese for the Aussies, and Charron with a deserving
effort from a short range scrum for the Canadians, and that was how it
ended.

IT'S just before nine o'clock and a smattering of people are waiting
in the cool evening air outside an unremarkable high street apartment
block. It could be Sauchiehall Street. It could be the Royal Mile. In
fact it's ul. Szeroka, a pedestrian shopping street in the centre of
Torun, a picturesque Polish town three hours from Warsaw.
The door opens and we're let in. At the top of the building three
rooms of an ordinary residential flat have been taken over for a
performance of an abridged version of The Cherry Orchard retitled A Shot
in an Autumn Orchard by Kiev's Experimental Theatre. There is one row of
chairs and two long benches. The audience cannot number more than 25 --
there is not space for more -- and of those most, like me, are wearing
the official badge of the Kontakt International Theatre Festival.
Despite the small scale, we're all given headphones for a simultaneous
translation from the original Russian into either English or Polish.
Having left Scotland the day before to the sound of another funding
furore about Scottish Opera, a company that plays to many thousands of
people every year, I find it hard to reconcile such different attitudes
to the value of art.
Here in the centre of Poland, a country like its neighbours still
finding its economic feet after the fall of communism, it's possible for
a tiny invited audience to see an 11-strong cast, plus singer and three
musicians, perform not in the name of bums-on-seats but purely in the
name of art.
I'd come to Torun for the last chunk of this nine-day festival that
puts on two or three productions a day from across Europe and beyond --
Theatr Clwyd from Wales, Xi Ju Che Jian from China, and Poland's
Wierszalin were just three companies to have played before my arrival.
Pitched at fellow theatre practitioners, Kontakt crops up in venues
all over the town -- a tram depot, an exhibition hall, the regular
theatre -- and every night there'd be intense public discussions fuelled
by vodka and cigarettes about that day's work.
Chairing these meetings, festival director Krystyna Meissner would
think nothing of accusing a director of producing boring theatre -- and,
in the spirit of constructive debate, he would happily answer without
malice. The theatre's revolutionary function might have disappeared in
Eastern Europe in these democratic times, but it's still treated with a
sense of seriousness, even earnestness, quite alien to the showbiz
values of the West.
Festivals of this kind are for making connections. It's Friday
afternoon, I'm sitting at a suburban bus stop outside a municipal
swimming baths somewhere in the middle of Poland, and here's Richard
Demarco running through his line-up for this year's Edinburgh Fringe.
I tell him he should conduct all his press conferences like this and
for a moment he's quite taken with the idea. I wouldn't put it past him.
This is, after all, a man who is planning to take the Fringe to Dundee
this summer with a six-hour Lithuanian trilogy that will begin in
Edinburgh on board a Pete Waterman locomotive. That's the plan, and we
should be grateful that at 64, Demarco is still daft enough to dream it
up.
He tells me that he shouldn't really be in Torun, that he's meant to
be meeting people in Warsaw and then he's got a meeting in Dundee on
Sunday, but, well, he knows so many folk here and he couldn't resist the
temptation (''There's someone I want to introduce you to,'' is a Demarco
catch-phrase).
He's got his eye on the Ukrainian Chekhov and he thinks he knows just
the garden flat in Edinburgh for it. Wait until the owners find out. For
the Torun production a member of the festival staff agreed to move out
of his own flat whereupon one wall was demolished and the whole place
redecorated.
Later on over a bowl of Polish soup, Demarco bemoans the lack of
intellectual life in Scotland, the failure of the Edinburgh Festival to
recognise the changing face of Europe and the odd state of affairs in
which he can be feted abroad and be all but homeless in Edinburgh.
But still, as he sits outside on this warm spring evening, his Jenners
carrier bag in tow, Demarco seems too much to belong to Edinburgh ever
to be able to leave it behind for long.
I'd bumped into him at a water puppet performance by the Hanoi
National Puppet Theatre that used the swimming baths in place of the
flooded paddy fields of Vietnamese tradition. In front of a huge
floating pagoda, a series of dragons, snakes, cattle, lion-dogs, and
children would emerge magically from the water, operated by unseen
puppeteers hidden inside.
If ultimately the form proved limited, most of the puppets doing
little more than splashing about, it was still unlike anything I'd seen
before.
In various ways this was true of a number of the productions I saw --
shows that would make a stunning impression in the first 10 minutes only
to go on to repeat themselves or to appear more substantial than the
plays themselves justified. But standards were universally high and
there was much quality work, from Silviu Pucarete's Phaedre (previously
seen at Glasgow's Tramway) to a disturbingly frank analysis of German
nationalism in Clouds Homeland, written by Elfriede Jelinek and
performed by the Deutsches Schauspielhaus.
The overall mood was certainly grim -- be it in the morose though
visually arresting Polish production of Strindberg's To Damascus, or the
psychological torments of Tankred Dorst's This Letter Was Written To Me
by Fernando Krapp produced by Torun's own theatre company -- but that
only reinforced the sense of seriousness with which the art of theatre
is taken over there, the willingness to push things to their
uncomfortable extremes, and the shared assumption between actors and
audience that drama should be demanding, uncompromising and unrelenting
in its artistic ambition.

New Zealand 34, Wales 9
FLY-HALF Andrew Mehrtens kicked 19 points as New Zealand comfortably
beat Wales in their Rugby World Cup Pool C match on Johannesburg last
night.
Tries by centre Walter Little and left wing Marc Ellis gave New
Zealand a deserved 20-6 half-time lead after sustained All Black
pressure.
Welsh fly-half Neil Jenkins had opened the scoring with a neatly
executed drop goal but Mehrtens soon levelled with a penalty before
Little gave New Zealand the lead.
The ball ran loose and was scooped up by Mehrtens who swiftly passed
for Little to scamper behind the posts.
Shortly before the break Ellis ran around Ieuan Evans to score.
Mehrtens added the two points.
Two penalties by Mehrtens extended the lead before Jenkins responded
with a penalty. From a ruck close to the Wales line, the ball came back
to Mehrtens who coolly kicked a drop goal.
Just when it looked as if New Zealand were to be denied any further
tries, Lomu opened up the Welsh defence. He was eventually wrestled to
the ground, but flanker Josh Kronfeld was by his side to go on and
score.

BARCELONA has gained the nod ahead of Edinburgh as Scotland's Graeme
Smith begins the serious build-up to the European swimming Championships
in Vienna in August.
Smith will compete in an international meet in the Spanish city next
week, but is not be among the entries for the Scottish championships at
Edinburgh's Commonwealth Pool in three weeks' time.
''After Barcelona, he will be getting his head down and putting in six
weeks of really hard training,'' explained his Stockport Metro coach,
Dave Caleja. ''He will not be competing in either the Scottish or
British championships. They do not fit into the schedule.''
Smith, the only Scot in the British team for the European event, is
also one of the leading medal hopes. Third in last year's European 1500
metres free-style rankings, his main rivals will be German pair Jorg
Hoffmann and Steffen Zesner, and the Russian, Victor Andreev.

England 27, Italy 20
ROB Andrew was again the goal-kicking difference between England and a
World Cup embarrassment, with a 17-point haul as Italy came within a
converted try of producing an upset.
England scored their first tries of the tournament, the Underwood
brothers bagging two beautiful touchdowns, but they were mugged into
giving away one try to Paolo Vaccari following a Mike Catt error and
conceded a second to Itaian captain Massimo Cuttitta in the final move
of the game.
England are now safely into the last eight, but they need to produce
something special in their final pool game against fellow
quarter-finalists Western Samoa to boost their flagging confidence.
''We played with some pride and passion and that was missing against
Argentina,'' said Andrew. ''But this fixture again proved there are no
easy games for us in this World Cup.
''We scored two lovely tries. It was an improvement on our display
against Argentina, but we can get a great deal better.''
They will need to. The result of the Western Samoan tie on Sunday,
also in Durban, is technically irrelevant, but a defeat would put
another massive dent in the morale of an England side that was bouyant
on its arrival in South Africa.
Australia are England's probable quarter-final opponents and the world
champions will not let them off the hook with this type of show.
They just shaded the line-outs 23-21 and the penalty count was equal,
leaving Andrew as the only tangible difference between the two teams.
It began well for England, Phil De Glanville and Catt running beyond
halfway to free Tony Underwood for a converted try.
Argentina-born Diego Dominguez cut the deficit with a penalty, but
Andrew landed three before half-time to leave England comfortably placed
at 16-3. But they were given a shock when Catt conceded a converted try
to Vaccari for a less appealing 16-10 advantage at the interval.
That was transformed into a 27-10 lead after 62 minutes. Andrew and
Catt combined to send Rory Underwood over, and Andrew then collected his
fourth and fifth penalties.
But England failed to score in the last 18 minutes and almost conceded
two more tries before Dominguez kicked another penalty. It summed up
England's fortunes when a series of defensive errors allowed Italy's
forwards to set up Cuttitta for a late converted try.

England -- Catt; A Underwood, de Glanville, Guscott, R Underwood;
Andrew, Bracken; Rowntree, Moore, Leonard, Johnson, Bayfield, Rodber,

THE scenario for this Saturday's Glenmorangie Camanach Cup final
appears to be simple enough -- Oban Camanachd would appear to be on a
hiding to nothing.
Opponents Kingussie will arrive in Oban as the hottest favourites for
the famous Challenge Trophy for many years, but will travel warily given
what underdogs Kyles did to Fort William in the final at Inverness last
year.
Kingussie would appear to have all the ace cards, none more so than
the gifted Ronald Ross, whose deeds this year have only been matched in
sporting terms by Gavin Hastings.
Ross captained Scotland's under-21 squad in Ireland in October, won
the national player of the year award, and has also been selected as
north player of the year.
To that lot he added the Badenoch and Strathspey District sports
council personality award this week. All this is on top of the 62 goals
he has scored to date.
Oban's defence is their greatest asset, but the Argyll side may gamble
on the versatility and experience of Gordon MacIntyre, who may be thrown
forward from defence in a bid to solve the goal drought which has
blighted their end-of-season form.
Four weeks ago, Oban Camanachd were grand slam contenders, but then
they met Kingussie at Inverness in the national league final and the
champions were in irresistible form.
The thrashing Oban took that day caused their form to nose-dive and
they then lost their Celtic Society title to Inveraray the following
week.
Saturday's match is an all-or-nothing affair for Camanachd. They have
at least one advantage though, in that their vociferous home support
could be worth a goal of a start to them and that could be a crucial
factor.
The fact that Kingussie won their first Grand Slam, in 1984, on the
same pitch as which they will play on Saturday will not be lost on them
as they try to win the trophy for the seventh time in 10 appearances.

THE pickings have been scarce for Scottish hockey clubs in Europe this
season. MIM, the Indoor Championship B Division winners, are the only
side to win a medal. But that situation could change when Western Klick
Photopoint and McMahon Kelburn step on to the international arena in the
European Club championships this weekend.
Western, the Scottish champions for the past 13 years are Britain's
most successful side in the event. They have won silver medals on five
occasions and bronze twice.
This weekend could see the Glasgow girls take a step nearer fulfilling
a gold goal when they compete in Utrecht, Holland. Stade Fracais and
Swansea are their first two group opponents and neither should prevent
them from going into their meeting with hosts Kampong on Sunday with a
maximum record.
Meanwhile at Linwood Kelburn will host the finals of the Men's B
Division. They are seeded only fifth of eight, following Torbrex
Wanderers' disastrous campaign last year, and they have their work cut
out to reach the final.
Kelburn will play all their three group matches at 2pm. They start
their campaign tomorrow against Stockholm, but their crucial match will
be on Saturday against Racing Club of France. Victory in that encounter
is likely to leave their tussle with Whitchurch of Wales of only
academic interest in their search for a place in Monday's final.

MORTON yesterday received a passport into the transfer market thanks
to the draw for the opening rounds of the Coca-Cola Cup.
The Greenock club will travel to Ibrox on August 19 to face Rangers in
their second-round tie in a major money-spinner for the first division
club.
Vice-chairman Douglas Rae promised his club's fans: ''This will enable
us to go after the players we want.''
That will be welcome news for manager Allan McGraw as he recovers in
hospital from another major knee operation.
Morton expect to lose midfielder Derek McInnes, whose contract is up
at the end of this month. But McGraw has already been considering his
next moves to strengthen the squad.
Meadowbank went into the draw under their new name of Livingston and
will travel to face Montrose in the first round, which will be played on
Saturday August 5: Draw:
Ross County v Arbroath, Brechin City v East Fife, Queen of the South v
Queen's Park, Clyde v East Stirling, Berwick Rangers v Caledonian
Thistle, Albion Rovers v Cowdenbeath, Montrose v Livingston, Alloa v
Forfar.
The second-round ties, on Saturday, August 19, are:
Aberdeen v St Mirren, Clydebank v Motherwell, Dunfermline v Stranraer,
Albion Rovers or Cowdenbeath v Dundee United, Raith Rovers v Ross County
or Arbroath, Queen of the South or Queen's Park v Falkirk, Kilmarnock v
Dumbarton, Ayr v Celtic, St Johnstone v Montrose or Livingston, Clyde or
East Stirling v Dundee, Rangers v Morton, Berwick Rangers or Caledonian
Thistle v Partick Thistle, Hibernian v Stenhousemuir, Brechin or East
Fife v Airdrie, Hearts v Alloa or Forfar, Stirling Albion v Hamilton.
* FALKIRK chairman George Fulston saw off the challenge of Celtic's
Eric Riley yesterday to become vice-president of the Scottish League.
Partick Thistle's Jim Oliver is now on the committee as a premier
division represenative with George Peat, of Airdrie, representing the
first division.

PAUL Gascoigne is haunted by the fear of the lunatic challenge which
would destroy him for good.
England's most gifted player launches the third phase of his
international career this weekend with no private doubts that he can
recapture the old, explosive touch and start collecting medals instead
of medical records.
An as-yet-unconfirmed #5million rescue from Lazio by Rangers and total
support from Terry Venables, who has rushed him back into contention for
Saturday's Umbro Cup opener against Japan, represent a welcome new start
at the age of 28.
But after two self-inflicted injuries and a four-year fight to keep
his career alive, every statement of intent is accompanied by a
benediction, a prayer for good health. ''I can be as good as I was,''
said Gascoigne. ''But if I play in a game and some guy launches a
two-footed tackle and smashes my left knee, I'm out of the game again.
''The couple of times I've been injured have been because I wanted to
win too much,'' he admitted. ''I have to learn to relax a bit more.
''But I've learned from my mistakes, we've talked about it a lot and
now I'm just looking forward to any game, to be involved in anything.''
He looks better than ever after losing around three stone, but said:
''I can't win with you guys -- first I'm too fat, now I'm too slim. I'm
happy with the way I am, full stop.''
* CELTIC defender Tosh McKinlay, fresh from his celebrations after the
cup final win, was able to add another wee toast to himself yesterday
when was called into the Scotland squad to meet the Faroe Islands next
week in the European Championship qualifying tie. McKinlay, who has
never been capped, comes into the pool after Craig Brown lost Pat Nevin,
who withdrew because of injury on Monday.
* DUTCH star Ruud Gullit yesterday confirmed he had signed a two-year
deal with Chelsea on a free transfer from Italian club Sampdoria.
The move is expected to cost the Stamford Bridge club #1.5m with
Gullit earning around #15,000 per week.
One of Gullit's main motives for joining the club was manager Glenn
Hoddle's agreement to play him as a sweeper, the position in which he
started his career in Holland.
* DIEGO Maradona yesterday revealed he is ''almost certain'' to sign
for Brazilian club Santos and don the famous No 10 shirt once worn by
the great Pele. The 34-year-old former Argentinian captain said all that
remained was ''a few little things and my signature.''
* BERNIE Slaven, the Paisley-born former Middlesbrough and Republic of
Ireland striker, now with Darlington, has been forced to quit football
because of a back problem.
* JOE Miller is ready to stay with Aberdeen for the rest of his
career. The player, who inspired the Pittodrie club's fight for premier
division survival, insists they will be challenging for honours in the
future.
That news will disappoint his former club Celtic and Queens Park
Rangers, who both tracked Miller as he dramatically returned to form.
* DUNDEE manager Jim Duffy will fly to France on Monday for crucial
talks with French goalkeeper Michel Pageaud. The 28-year-old went home
at the end of the season, threatening to quit Dens Park because he found
it difficult settling in Scotland.
Meantime, Duffy has had some success with re-signings. Ray Farningham,
Gary McKeown and Marcus Dailly have accepted new deals, while YTS pair
Graham Cadger and Darren Magee have signed as full-timers.
* TED Drake, the former Arsenal and England striker, who also managed
Chelsea and Barcelona, has died aged 82 after a short illness.
* FIFA are to set up a commission of enquiry to investigate the
corruption that has recently rocked the sport.
FIFA general secretary Joseph Blatter said the commission would
initially focus on incidents at the World Youth Championships in Qatar,
when five people were deported after trying to bribe players.
* CALEDONIAN Thistle yesterday appointed Doug McGilvray, the managing
director of an international crane hire firm, as their new chairman. He
succeeds John MacDonald, who is also retiring from the SFA.
* SHEFFIELD Wednesday, Tottenham Hotspur and Wimbledon have all done a
U-turn and decided to compete in the Intertoto Cup this summer. The FA
Premiership said the three will be England's representatives in the
competition designed to give a second chance of European qualification.

MUCH North-east art reaches back to archaeology, to ancient symbols,
relics, stones, and monuments -- to archetypes, perhaps, but always
through the specific, through objects.
This is clearly present in Lennox Dunbar's work, but the valuable
catalogue essays by Arthur Watson and Gavin Robson suggest also how
immediate his concerns are: he is dealing specifically with the present
changes to the land -- the new, tame, forests, the new houses built from
kits for commuter villages, on grid patterns, the new farming dictated
from Brussels.
The exhibition is of mixed media works on paper, often large-scale:
''drawings'' seems the right word to describe them, though they are
drawings in paint. There is a very substantial feel to the images,
through the texture and surface of paint as matter -- so there is a
sense of sculpture, of material, without a real resemblance to
sculptors' drawings -- two dimensions out of three rather than two
dimensions imagining three -- perhaps a mixture of a two-dimensional
sensibility with the craftsman's use of tools, of gouging if not
carving, to be expected from a printmaker who has worked on woodcuts.
Formally, there are three kinds of picture space: a ''relief'' space,
improvised from the surfaces of sheds and fences and barns, with planks
suggesting all manner of symbols out of a pragmatic patching; a
landscape space, with a high view, a move to distance, perhaps a
horizon, certainly a ground, strewn with felled wood, where regularly
spaced buildings form crosses; and a half-way, concertina space,
close-up buildings with wall retreating in perspective.
The relief pictures are very strong; the ''plot'' pictures represent a
major breakthrough in the work of a fine artist.

AFTER 107 years, the Paisley Art Institute continues to flourish.
Unashamedly welcoming and open, it encourages artists to provide good,
vigorous work and offers something for everyone.
This choice of subject, style -- and price (from #45 to #9000) --
makes it an excellent place for collectors, with a plethora of
attractive pictures like Hazel Nagl's decorative Old Ranfurly landscape,
Liz Knox's sweeping Sutherland shores, Alan King's dramatic red and
black Palio or James Spences's Phillipson-esque Diomedes with its
classic figures and horses.
Portraits are strong. Helen Wilson makes a great splash -- and wins
the Mary Armour Prize with a wonderfully bold study of her painter
friend Mary. Kathryn Kynock takes a gentler path to capture a bohemian
chap in wide-brimmed hat while Robert Mulhern took out the Institute
Prize with an elegant rendition of a resting ex-dancer, her pose
immaculately held, precisely caught. Josephine Graham's Aubade is
another notable image, so too Des Gorman's self-portraits and Sue
Beach's sunbathers.
The main room holds several blockbuster pictures. Joe Hargan's red and
yellow Gilded Cage is fine as it straddles figurative abstraction while
his Wicked Witch barely contains its wild tune. Mitchie's quirky, bouncy
Trellis with its vertical sticks, is an instructive example of how to
pit yourself against the grain. Annette Edgar's sunburst is palpable.
William Birnie's orchard Letterbox epitomises our best escapist dreams
of sun and shade.
This year invitees include David Michie, RSA, RSW; Edward Gage MBE,
RSW; Douglas Davies and Sandy Moffat; a selection includes two painters
from Edinburgh and a ceramicist. Shows how broad Paisley's vista is.

LIZ McColgan will run the 10,000 metres for Britain at the European
Cup in Lille on June 24 and 25.
It will be the former world champion's first track race since the
Barcelona Olympics in 1992, and success would put her on a collision
course to face fellow Commonwealth champion Yvonne Murray at the World
Championships in Sweden later this year.
McColgan confirmed last night that she has been told of her selection
verbally, and written confirmation is expected today. The British
Athletic Federation is due to make a formal announcement of the
endurance places for men and women tomorrow.
The race is vital to McColgan's come-back plans. ''It is really my
only chance of recording a qualifying time for the World Championships
in Gothenburg,'' said Liz.
Often cup endurance events are tactical, but McColgan, who clocked
30mins 57.07secs to win the world title four years ago, has vowed to
take it out in order to qualify.
If she beats 32-30, she is effectively guaranteed a 10,000m place,
alongside Murray, and a chance of regaining the title won by China's
Wang Junxia in 1993 when she was sidelined by injury. Murray will run
the cup 5000m in Lille.
Since finishing sixth in the London Marathon, McColgan has suffered an
iron deficiency and virus which caused a respiratory infection, all of
which have now cleared up.
McColgan plans a 5000m road race in Berne a week on Sunday, when she
meets Derartu Tulu, the Ethiopian Olympic champion who beat Murray by
one second on Saturday in Portsmouth.
''I'm convinced that track 10,000m fitness is the way to marathon
success,'' says McColgan.
After winning the world title in 1991 she ran the fastest debut
marathon ever. Now she is looking to track success this season as launch
pad to an Olympic marathon medal in Atlanta next year.
Liz's selection for the European Cup turns the clock back two seasons.
She was chosen for this race two years ago, but withdrew -- because of
the knee injury problems which subsequently threatened to end her
career.

THE Brunton Hall in Musselburgh will again be packed to capacity
tonight as Tranent's Willie ''The Mighty'' Quinn bids for his first
professional title, the WBO Continental championship, against the
holder, Paul Busby, of Worcester.
The 23-year-old Scot, who has one of the most fervent followings in
the sport, despite having previously boxed only in modest company, sees
tonight as his chance to make a breakthrough to the big time and will
give everything to send his fans home happy.
Busby, however, represents a real step up in class. Quinn has strung
together 16 wins since losing on his professional debut, while the
Englishman has lost three and drawn one of his 21 contests. But the
champion has moved in higher circles and will have an edge on experience
tonight.
Quinn, however, can never be dismissed, especially when his home-town
crowd are right behind him, as they will be tonight. And the man from
Tranent, in recent fights, has shown a steady improvement. If he
maintains that sort of progress then he is capable of taking the title.
Busby won the title by outpointing Wayne Ellis, from Wales, over 12
rounds last November and made a successful first defence with another
points win over Warren Stowe. Like Quinn, Busby is eager for a crack at
bigger things and will be in a determined mood tonight.
The champion is a good mover and will try to frustrate the Scot, but
he is prone to cut. It is a close one to call, but, especially with home
advantage, Quinn must be favourite.
On the undercard, Quinn's younger brother Tommy, unbeaten in three
professional contests at welterweight -- all have finished inside the
distance -- takes on Micky Hall, of Ludworth, and he can expect the same
noisy support as Willie, which should help him maintain his unbeaten
record.
At light-welter, the very promising Steve McLevy, of Glasgow, also
defends an unbeaten professional record when he takes on Englishman
Wayne Shepherd. McLevy has now had six paid fights and is one of the
best prospects in the country. Shepherd shouldn't cause any upset.
* FRANK Warren's plans to stage Steve Collins' re-match with Chris
Eubank on Mike Tyson's comeback bill in Las Vegas on August 19 have been
knocked out by the WBO.
The organisation has given a hard-and-fast order that Collins-Eubank
II must go ahead by July 31, and the British promoter is aiming to beat
that deadline by two days and feature it in Dublin on July 29.
Warren, partner of American promoter Don King, has won the purse
bidding for the return fight with an offer of almost #1.6m, holding off
the counter move of Scotland's Tommy Gilmour by some #380,000.
It means that new champion Collins, who dented Eubank's unbeaten
record in Millstreet, County Cork, in March, will break the
million-pound barrier for the first time in his career (#1.2m).
Eubank's #400,000 purse is something like half of his normal take-home
pay, but, for the first time in nearly five years, he will be the title
challenger.
The former champion has become the big-sequel fighter, having been
involved in WBO re-matches with arch-rival Nigel Benn, Michael Watson,
and Ulsterman Ray Close.
This will be the start of a promotional relationship between Collins
and Warren, who said: ''The Eubank fight is the last of Steve's contract
with Barry Hearn, which went to purse offers, and after that he is a
free agent. We have agreed a four-fight package to start after that.
''The fact that Collins-Eubank can't go ahead on the Tyson comeback
bill has killed the mega-exposure it would have got,'' added Warren.
''I'm highly delighted that Steve is now on our team and hope that he
can win this one and that will set up some bigger fights for him later
in the year.''

NAIRN did it again on Tuesday night: showed up the rest of the country
in its commitment to one-off inter-festival jazz concerts. The name to
be added to the town's already impressive list of successes is that of
British-based American clarinetist/saxophonist Bob Wilber.
Wilber is a paradoxical figure. His precise, professional appearance,
while reflected in the polished nature of his arrangements, is really a
foil for the passion and energy of his playing style. The academic
(visual) image is underlined by one of his instrumental choices -- his
celebrated curved soprano sax which, at about half the length of the
straight soprano sax, looks like an extra-large pipe.
The curved model was used to best effect on Wilber's breathtaking
marathon through Hindustan, but the straight soprano was favoured with
more numbers. As promised, it made an altogether different sound from
its wee brother: bolder, more commanding, and more elegantly fluid. That
sound was showcased on two ballads -- the stunning Indian Summer and
Wilber's own exquisite Reverie.
Although Wilber's clarinet was the most exercised instrument of the
evening, it was the least inspiring -- but only because of the
competition. Its lilting performance on What a Difference A Day Makes,
however was a contender in the knock-out stakes.
Impressive, too, was the rest of the band, with Dave Cliff's guitar
input in particular, perfectly complementing Wilber's playing. The
quartet appears to be jinxed. Before the gig, it was announced that
Wilber's regular pianist, Mick Pyne, died last week -- Brian Dee proved
a worthy substitute -- and midway through the evening the band's superb
bass player, Dave Green, had to be ambulanced off to hospital, but the
band played on.

IN THE days when symbolism was king, European dramatists were fond of
creating allegorical significance out of everyday events. There was a
particular concentration too, on the bourgeoisie's collusion in the
corruption of democracy. Lenka Udovicki's revival of Max Frisch's The
Fire Raisers, part of the Redgrave's Memory season, is a cheeky reminder
of how persuasive such heavily disguised political drama can still be.
Written in 1956 with clear reference to recent past events in Europe
and the outbreak of fascism, The Fire Raisers is a glittering satire on
middle-class myopia epitomised by the upstanding Biedermans, Gottlieb
and Babette, who welcome into their home -- or rather allow themselves
to be invaded by -- two anarchic figures. A homeless wrestler and a
one-time former waiter, they turn out to be, literally, agents from
hell.
Frisch has huge enjoyment at the expense of his guardians of decorum,
underlined in a naughty epilogue, strongly reminiscent of Shaw's Don
Juan in Hell (also recently seen in this festival), when the Biedermans
find themselves, for all their good intentions, sent to the other place.
His message, however, remains a deeply serious one: conformity can
blind us to seeing what is directly under our noses, and lead to
dangerous cowardice. ''Who wears a uniform when killing is sacred''
still strikes a chilling chord.
Udovicki's production, with Malcolm Tierney and Frances de la Tour as
the well-meaning but deluded Biedermans is imaginative, if sometimes a
little unfocused. Philippe Brandt's double-storey attic set and the
London-dressed chorus of firemen, led by David Hargreaves, make this,
however, in Michael Bullock's serviceable translation, an enjoyable and
valuable revival of a too-long neglected European classic.

At the MURPHY'S ENGLISH OPEN
SAM Torrance yesterday enjoyed an unusual way of celebrating
qualification for his twenty-fourth successive Open championship -- by
virtue of having finished in the first 50 on the Sony world rankings on
the deadline date -- by leading a distinguished team of Test cricketers
in the Pro-Am competition on the eve of the #650,000 Murphy's English
Open.
In five hours, about the time often needed to make centuries, the
41-year-old Ryder Cup player and his partners -- Mike Atherton,
currently England's captain, Ian Botham, a beleaguered predecessor in
that dangerous office, and fast bowler Darren Gough -- had a combined
score of 60, 12 under par over the Forest of Arden course.
No Aggers nor Bloers was on hand to commentate on this prolonged
innings -- nor was needed. Torrance's appraisal was of Atherton
(handicap 12), ''a lovely player''; of Gough (18), ''gives it a swipe
and then another''; and of Botham (7), ''maybe he could play on the
seniors tour -- but only after a lot of work''.
Subsequently Botham, aged 39, denied reports that he wanted to take
that step. ''I only play golf for the fun of it,'' he declared. ''I
would, though, like to reach County standard.'' Since he lives on
Alderney, his qualification would be for Hampshire, which includes the
Channel Islands in its golfing territory.
For at least the next two days, however, Torrance will put such
informalities firmly to one side and he again finds himself in
interesting company. His partners for the first two rounds are Colin
Montgomerie, last year's winner, and Michael Campbell, the New Zealand
Maori whose Scottish antecedents almost make them three of a kind.
Torrance has this season ventured where only two other British
professionals have trod in 16 tournaments -- the winner's enclosure. The
Italian champion's predecessors were his fellow Scot, Adam Hunter, in
the Portuguese Open, and Mark James in the Moroccan Open -- renewed
confirmation that the process of winning in Europe has become harder.
Five of the seven new winners so far are Continentals and four other
winners come from further afield. Montgomerie, with his coach Bill
Ferguson in faithful attendance, would, however, like nothing better
than to achieve another personal best -- to defend a title successfully.
''I'd rather win here in Britain than next week in Germany,''
Montgomerie said, looking beyond to the US Open, in which he has
finished in the first three in two of the past three years. ''Winning
takes too much out of you and I'd rather come away from Hamburg just
having played well.''
Montgomerie, currently eighth on the order of merit, which he is
attempting to win for a third successive year (last accomplished by
Severiano Ballesteros in 1978), was unhappy to have had two double bogey
6s before the turn at Wentworth on Monday, but as usual he reached a
positive conclusion -- four rounds of par or better.
Of those at or near the climax of the Volvo PGA championship, the
winner, Bernhard Langer, is sitting out the challenge for the #108,330
first prize. Nick Faldo, sharply reminded that a one-off reappearance is
unlikely to be rewarded with victory, and Jesper Parnevik have resumed
loyalties transferred to the US tour. There in March Ian Woosnam's
dormant career flowered briefly. Otherwise, in only three appearances in
Europe -- all in the past five weeks -- Woosnam has missed the past two
cuts.
A prolonged midwinter break may accord with the life of a Jersey tax
exile rather than a professional golfer, however talented.
Bernard Gallacher, Europe's Ryder Cup captain, is almost resigned to
having to use one of his selections for Faldo (seventeenth on the points
list), but Woosnam, having begun this season in fourth place, is now
eleventh. Gallacher says, almost prayerfully, of Woosnam as he struggles
to repossess a reliable method: ''He is the type who has highs and lows,
and he can bounce back from this downer.''

MEMORIAL TOURNAMENT
NICK Faldo, who only returned to the USA on Tuesday after a trip home
for last week's Volvo PGA Championship at Wentworth where he tied for
ninth, is the lone British player contesting the Memorial Tournament
which starts today in Columbus, Ohio.
This will be Faldo's final event before the US Open at Shinnecock
hills, Long Island, in a fortnight's time.
Faldo, who has never seen Shinnecock, will spend a few days there next
week, playing and familiarising himself with the course in peace and
quiet before the maddening crowds arrive.
He will then enjoy a few days at his house in Orlando before returning
to Shinnecock a day or two before the first round.
Tom Lehman, winner of the Colonial Invitation last Sunday, is
defending champion at Ohio, following his runaway five-shot triumph last
year. The quality field includes 37 of the world's top 50 golfers.
* CAWDER assistant Alan Tait continued his assault on the Tartan Tour
pro-am circuit yesterday with victory in the Rehab event at Haggs
Castle.
The 26-year-old, who smashed the Buchanan Castle course record with an
eight-under-par 62 three weeks ago, did not quite reach the same heady
heights but his five-under-par 68 was sufficient to pick up the winners
cheque.
Yet, with eight holes to play, victory looked a remote possibility for
Tait as he stood one-over-par.
But a sparkling home stretch, which included birdies at the twelfth
and thirteenth as well as a trio of birdies at the final three holes,
helped him home to pip a group of five players who ended their round on
69. Leading scores:
68 -- A Tait (Cawder).
69 -- G Gilmour (Paisley), J Chillas (Glenbervie), F Mann
(Musselburgh), C Maltman (Eyemouth), K Fairbairn (Goswick).
70 -- R Arnott (Caddy Shack).
71 -- J McCallum (Lenzie), B Dunbar (Easter Moffat), G Collinson
(Windyhill), P Smith (Deeside), B Marchbank (Marchbank Golf
Enterprises).
Leading team: 129 -- Scottish Power (Ian Young (pro), Ron Nelson,
David Shaw, Douglas Hendry).

FOR the past 25 years, Livingston Development Corporation has carried
out an annual employment survey, with the aim of monitoring the success
of its economic development and growth in terms of job creation.
The latest survey for the year to March showed total employment in the
town to be 25,694, an increase of 1231 over the previous year, with 1039
employers currently in Livingston, a net increase of 55 on the year.
Of the total jobs in the new town, 36% were in manufacturing
industries compared with just 18% in Scotland as a whole and 20% in
Great Britain, while the service sector provided 57% of employment,
against 72% and 73% in Scotland and Britain respectively.
The town's most significant growth in job terms was in the electrical,
electronic and instrument engineering sector which increased by 200. The
sector accounts for 19% of Livingston's total employment, compared with
just 3% for Britain as a whole. Electronics and other hi-tech industries
maintained their growth with a net increase of 170 jobs, and now account
for 20% of the total employment in the town.
Of the current 25,694 jobs, all of which have been attracted into
Livingston since 1962, a large proportion has been created in the past
decade or so.
Livingston Development Corporation's commercial director David
Balfour, applauding the latest figures says: ''This is our biggest net
increase in five years, and ensures that our record of creating an
average 1000 net new jobs each year since 1982, remains intact.''
''The catalyst for this was the decision by NEC to come here some 13
years ago and the sub-contracting developments, the companies which have
come in to support them have also been very important,'' comments Ken
Forrest, senior marketing officer with the development corporation.
''As market leaders, many others have followed them, not only to
Livingston but to just outside the town in the case of Motorola at
Easter Inch, and Sun Micro Systems in Linlithgow for example -- evidence
of the momentum triggered by the NEC decision.''
With an average age of 29, Livingston is a youthful town where the
population has shown itself to be hardworking and flexible. Paul Filipek
explains: ''We anticipate around 2000 school leavers per annum to the
end of the decade. West Lothian is extremely well placed in this regard
because of the age structure, and the volume of young people coming out
of the schools who have appropriate skills, aptitude and orientation to
take up a large proportion of the new jobs that have been created, while
retraining of others has been an important factor too.''
Almost 37% of Livingston's industrial employment was with employers
from overseas, 17% from North America and 14% from Japan. Of these, the
largest growth in industrial employment throughout the year came from
North American companies where jobs increased overall, by 322.

Lucy Lockhart reports from a town looking forward to the challenge of
going out on its own
SINCE its birth in 1962, Livingston new town has grown to healthy
maturity. Its population of 44,000 makes it of similar size to Perth,
Falkirk and Dunfermline, while its inward investment projects ensure the
town a place at the top of the league of major inward investment
locations in the UK.
Last week it announced yet another net jobs increase of 1200 in the
year to March.
Given its success then, it is ironic that as Livingston goes through
the busiest period of its existence, the development corporation staff
in common with their colleagues in the other new towns are in the
process of winding up its special status, scheduled in this case, to end
with the last days of 1996.
In line with the Government's review document Maintaining the
Momentum, the common aim has been to keep a foot on the accelerator, to
ensure that economic development will continue unabated, through liaison
with the LEC's local authorities and the private sector.
Livingston's lasting legacy is therefore uppermost in the minds of the
350 development corporation staff who now remain.
Over #200m-worth of construction activity is currently taking place
across 62 individual sites -- a figure four times greater than the
previous record of #50m in Livingston.
Within this investment is a #50m expansion of the shopping centre,
almost doubling its size to around 800,000 sqft to become one of the
largest covered and heated shopping centres in Scotland.
A planning application is expected soon for a large complex of
additional retail warehousing. Adjacent to this, the whole town centre
will be substantially expanded with new facilities from a civic square
to offices, and a district court added.
Close by a new football stadium will become home to Meadowbank Thistle
later this year, at which time the club's name will change to Livingston
Football Club. Through agreement with the Scottish Office, the
development corporation has assigned ownership of the football stadium
to West Lothian District Council, enabling the local authority to invest
#4.5m towards funding of town centre developments.
At Deans industrial estate NEC's #500m third-phase development, the
largest single inward investment project ever made in Scotland, and one
of the largest in the UK and western Europe, is under way. It is
expected to provide a further 400 to 500 jobs which will be boosted by
other employment opportunities through new support companies and
services.
Livingston's industrial and commercial land assets are being
transferred to parties who will judiciously develop these over the next
five to 10 years, with most of the major undeveloped sites being sold to
Locate In Scotland and Scottish Enterprise.
The development corporation's housing land will largely be sold to
private housebuilders -- around 20 are presently active in Livingston --
with developments continuing over the next decade.
Currently around 60% of the town's housing is owner-occupied, and 40%
rented. A 10% rise in the former is expected over the next 10 years. The
building of houses to rent is likely to continue also, mainly undertaken
by housing associations and possibly the local authority.
Paul Filipek, head of planning and landscape at the development
corporation explains: ''Much consideration and planning has gone into
the transfer also of responsibilities in environmental, civic and
community assets. We own many landscaped areas, woodland, community
centres, roads, and so on. To ensure their maintenance and continuation,
we have agreed a joining strategy with West Lothian District Council and
Lothian Regional Council to take these over. The new West Lothian
Council will receive an annual sum in excess of #2m.''
The large tracks of woodland owned by the development corporation will
be taken over by the Woodland Trust, with interest from an endownment
contributing towards annual maintenance costs, in perpetuity.
First-class communication links and its central position has ensured
Livingston has attracted important distribution investment, one of the
newest being Lidl, a major German supermarket chain, setting up
operations throughout Scotland, and currently building a 200,000 sqft
distribution centre.
The former Wm Low's distribution facility, now operated by Tesco, has
a major expansion under way.
''We'd like to think,'' says Paul Filipek, ''that in years to come,
Livingston will have a strong local authority presence, as the second
largest town in Lothian, and the centrepiece of West Lothian. The shadow
authority are presently occupying part of this building as their base
for the next year; we think that's a very good omen that they may decide
it may become a permanent main centre for the new council.''

FRENCH OPEN TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIP
WORLD No.2 Pete Sampras became a shock first-round casualty in the
French Open yesterday when he was knocked out in five sets by Austria's
Gilbert Schaller.
The American, whose match had been interrupted by bad light on Tuesday
in the third set, followed Croatian fourth seed Goran Ivanisevic out of
the tournament when he lost 6-7, 6-4, 7-6, 2-6, 4-6.
The match seemed to have turned the way of 23-year-old Sampras when he
captured the third-set tie-break to lead 2-1. But Schaller, playing a
steady baseline game, took the fourth easily, and although Sampras won
the opening game of the fifth, he then lost four in a row to trail 4-1.
Sampras pulled back to 4-4 but the 26-year-old Austrian held serve,
got to match point on a double fault, and then passed Sampras with a
running cross-court backhand to seal the victory.
It was the first time in six visits to the tournament that Sampras,
who has won the three other Grand Slam events, had lost in the opening
round. He reached the quarter-finals in the past three years. His big
serve failed him in a match spanning four hours over the two days.
''I knew I had a chance,'' said an elated Schaller. ''I knew he was
not too confident with his game of late and I knew that if I resisted
him, he would start to lose his temper.''
Schaller, world-ranked No.24, had warned he would be a tough man to
beat on clay this season. Since winning a tournament in Casablanca, he
has reached the last eight in all five clay-court events he has entered
this season.
Sampras, on the other hand, has had a lot of problems and his
preparation for Roland Garros was hampered by an ankle injury sustained
in Monte Carlo last month.
''This loss is going to sit with me for quite a while,'' admitted the
American. ''One of my main goals was to play well here and hopefully
win, and I changed all my preparation for that.''
Sampras added he now hoped to restore some pride by winning Wimbledon
for the third time in a row, saying: ''I just need to rebound from this
loss and get ready for Wimbledon.''
Sweden's three-time French Open champion Mats Wilander was ousted in
the second round by eighth seed Wayne Ferreira after a tense five-set
battle.
Playing in the tournament's second round for the first time in four
years, the 30-year-old Wilander, champion in 1982, 1985, and 1989,
pushed the South African to his limits before succumbing 7-6, 6-7, 7-6,
3-6, 7-6, 8-6.
Wilander, running round the court for four hours and 23 minutes as if
in his younger days, saved four match points before bidding farewell to
the event which revealed his great talent 13 years ago.
Austrian Thomas Muster had a much more comfortable afternoon and is
still unbeaten on clay this season after 30 matches on the surface.
Muster spent only 97 minutes on Centre Court in a 6-1, 6-3, 6-3
thrashing of Frenchman Cedric Pioline.
American Jim Courier, champion in 1991 and 1992 but seeded only No.13,
also was impressive, beating Kenneth Carlsen of Denmark 6-3, 6-4, 6-0.
Dutchman Richard Krajicek, seeded No.15, was the third seed to bow out
of the tournament, losing 6-3, 3-6, 4-6, 6-2, 4-6 to Australian
qualifier and world No.252, Andrew Ilie.

EUROPEAN Union agriculture commissioner Franz Fischler is to address
the July council meeting of the National Farmers' Union of Scotland. He
will speak on the future direction of the Common Agricultural Policy.
John Ross, president of the NFUS, said that at next year's
inter-governmental conference the moves towards a single European
currency and the accession of former East European communist countries
would be high on the agenda.
''Decisions on these subjects will be crucially important to the
development of the CAP and the wellbeing of Scottish agriculture,'' he
said. ''This will be an ideal opportunity for members of the council to
question the European Commissioner who will be playing a central role in
these decison-making procedures.''
Mr Ross also intimated that proposals would be submitted to the July
council for the creation of a public affairs and communications division
at union headquarters.

THE British Society of Plant Breeders sought yesterday to offer arable
farmers some re-assurance on the costs of introducing a scheme where
royalties would be charged on farm-saved seed.
Breeders are anxious to see an early start to a system whereby farmers
who save seed from a previous crop -- such as grain or potatoes -- would
still be obliged to pay a royalty.
The society estimates that remuneration on farm-saved cereal seed
would amount to no more than #7.60p a hectare (#3 an acre), even if the
top royalty rate was set at 80% of the category-two rate for certified
seed and growers used the most expensive varieties.
Many popular varieties would attract a lower payment and more than
half of the varieties currently on the recommended list would attract no
charges at all. Breeders have also agreed to study proposals for a
phasing in of payments, with a lower rate in the early stages building
up to a full rate over three years.
Delays in reaching agreement at European Commission level on what the
new rules will be have led to some bitter exchanges between the plant
breeders and agricultural contractors who have condemned the proposed
new arrangements as a ''snoopers charter'' -- with the contractor in the
middle being asked to give information on who was using farm-saved seed.
David Taylor, chairman of the society, said: ''On a winter wheat crop
with an output of about #800 a hectare the payment would be very modest,
even at the highest rate that is being bandied around.''
He pointed out that a royalty payment of #7.60 -- about #1 a tonne of
crop sold -- should be compared with a spend of some #40 a hectare on
fungicide alone. ''One pound a tonne is not a huge contribution to
essential research,'' he said.
The delay by the European Commission in releasing details of the new
rules on farm-saved seed had led to a lot of confusion in the industry,
he said.
''On the most expensive varieties like the winter wheat Brigadier, the
winter barley Hanna or the spring barley Optic, the payment, at 80% of
the category-two rate, would be #7.60 a hectare. On a winter wheat Like
Cadenza it would be less than #6 and on a variety like Lynx about #5.
It was certain, he said, that exemptions would apply until the year
2001 to winter wheats like Hereward, Haven, Mercia, Riband and Soissons.
Winter barleys like Puffin, Pipkin, Sprite and Halcyon would also be
exempt. More than half of all the varieties on the recommended list
would attract no payment at all. Only one potato variety, Saxon, would
be eligible for royalty payment.
''We want to strike a balance which is fair to all sides,'' said Mr
Taylor. Farm-saved-seed has been costing plant breeders #5m a year in
lost royalties for the past five years.
''Farmers, who sow certified seed, many of whom are small farmers, pay
the full royalty rate. It is unreasonable to expect those farmers to
provide 100% of the support for the variety improvements which benefit
all growers.''
He emphasised that farmers using farm-saved-seed got exactly the same
benefits as they would from certified seed. ''They receive the same area
payment and the same price for the grain.
''They trade on the variety name when the crop is sold. In addition
the seed is on the farm, saving haulage and certification costs.''

<HEADLINE>Rob Roy boost for beef</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>978108607</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE Scotch Quality Beef and Lamb Association has been quick off the
mark to follow the exhortations from Scottish Tourist Board chief
executive Derek Reid that every effort should be made to capitalise on
the recent boom in Scottish films made for the world cinema market.
The Rob Roy story, recently premiered in Edinburgh, is the vehicle
which SQUABLA have chosen for its own promotional purposes.
The organisation's current chairman, John McNaughton, an impressive
and distinguished figure in the kilt, farms at Inverlochlarig, the farm
in the Glen of Balquidder where Rob Roy spent the last 14 years of his
life.
Next week Mr McNaughton will be on stage at the Brussels premiere
introducing the film to a Belgian audience.
By way of introducing Mr McNaughton, SQUABLA chief executive Brian
Simpson has written an insert to the official programme drawing on Rob
Roy's links with sheep and cattle. Above all, he says, Rob Roy was a
Scottish farmer rearing sheep and beef cattle at a time when Scotland
was establishing its reputation as a source of the finest beef and lamb
in the world.
Tongue in cheek, he recalls that opportunities were ''created'' for
Rob Roy to select the best animals for some of the wealthy landowners in
the area. No mention of payment for goods selected here.
The chief executive goes on to paint a picture of glens stocked to the
hilt with Galloways and Aberdeen Angus cattle, chosen to produce calves
with loads of beef on their rumps and sirloins. The lush hill grasses
are identified as the source of ''taste, tenderness and mouth-watering
succulence.''
All of this, of course, leads up to an unashamed plug for today's
product and the Scotch Beef Clubs which now function in 600 of Europe's
top restaurants -- ''where the fruits of Rob Roy's labours can be
savoured and enjoyed.''
Guests at the post-premiere reception won't have long to wait to test
the accuracy of all of that -- Scotch beef will be on the supper menu,
and the quality had better be good.

THE VIEW which many people abroad have of Britain is one which is
based on tradition, class, and a certain amount of stuffiness. A recent
editorial in the Wall Street Journal referred to a survey carried out by
a respected advertising agency. This survey criticised Britain's image
abroad, comparing it with an ageing gentlemen's club and commented that
by marketing its past Britain was failing to associate itself with
progress.
In many ways, of course, this image is not at all representative of
the diversity of life in Britain in the 1990s. Nevertheless, this
traditional image is one which underpins many of our leading brands and
is often used as a marketing tool by those selling British goods and
services overseas. This is particularly the case for some of our luxury
brands, which by their very nature want to cultivate an air of
exclusivity.
However, welcome moves are afoot, at least in some quarters, to try to
soften the somewhat staid image which could be detrimental to the
development of new business. Given that we are now operating in a global
market it is no longer possible to rely simply on marketing the fact
that a product or service is British. The wealth of buying opportunities
world-wide is such that if the quality and value is not right and if the
product or service has not been updated to keep up with the changing
aspirations of consumers, then business will be lost.
Historically, few British companies have been world class. Their
inefficiencies and shortcomings have quickly become associated with the
negative aspects of the ''British brand''. However, today there are many
British companies that are competitive and efficient by world standards.
They can build on the strengths and positive attributes of the British
brand and avoid the negative connotations.
It is possible to combine traditional values of quality with more
up-to-date refinements as increasing numbers of businesses, like Marks &amp;
Spencer, are proving. Those products which are seen to be
quintessentially British, such as muffins, Fair Isle jumpers, tweed
clothing, are all the rage in Paris. There is probably something of a
novelty factor at work initially but if business is to prosper in the
long term then its appeal has to be built on more than its geographic
origin.
John Letters golf equipment has been synonymous with Scottish
craftsmenship and quality for almost three-quarters of a century and has
been a favourite with many of the great players for much of that time.
However the company has not rested on its laurels. It has allied
traditional skills to sophisticated technology, producing highly
futuristic models such as Trilogy and Calculus.
There are some sections of British industry which appear to be held in
greater esteem abroad than at home. One thinks of the British fashion
industry, which is often reluctant to back its own innovative young
designers, many of whom have had to move to countries such as Italy and
France to find financial support. Just as the avant-garde design skills
of our fashion designers are sought overseas so increasingly are
manufactured products such as cars from Rover and Jaguar.
Although President of the Board of Trade Michael Heseltine has adopted
a high profile in the promotion of British business abroad there is as
yet no national body charged with the task. In this respect Britain
differs from several of its major competitors such as Japan and France,
although this oversight will be remedied in the autumn.
On October 24 a new Marketing Council will be launched as a coalition
between Government and the private sector to raise British marketing
standards to world-class levels. Sir Colin Marshall, chairman of British
Airways, is to chair the council.
Currently, an attempt to plug the promotional gap in the UK is being
made by, among others, the Walpole Committee. It was established in 1992
by a group of leading British companies which felt a need to promote the
country's reputation for quality goods and services, especially abroad.
Its members include a roll call of some the great British brands:
Ballantine's, Daks Simpson, British Airways, Pringle, John Letters,
Mappin and Webb, and Walkers.
Among the committee's plans is the creation of the Walpole Collection,
bringing together products and services which are brilliant in concept
and design while maintaining traditional quality and uncompromising
excellence. While politicians come and go, the business of operating and
selling abroad continues and so it is vital that a committed, focused
independent organisation such as this takes on the task.
After all, the innovative brands of today will be the traditional ones
of tomorrow.

Using all the resources of talent at his disposal in stunning
portrayal of Bloomsbury bitchiness will do this star no harm says
WILLIAM RUSSELL.
AN opportunity to ''indulge in a little eccentricity, a little
bitchiness'' is how Jonathan Pryce described his Cannes prize-winning
role as Lytton Strachey in Christopher Hampton's Carrington. ''It was
also a lot of fun,'' he added.
Pryce is no stranger to theatrical awards -- he got a Tony in 1976 for
The Comedians, the play in which he made his name as an actor, and again
in 1991 for his role as the pimp in the musical, Miss Saigon, for which
he also received Olivier and a Variety Club awards -- but his film
career has been less distinguished. It is no fault of his. He is simply
not a leading man in the film-star sense, so his roles have tended to be
supporting character parts. Cannes's best actor award should raise his
status considerably.
In Carrington, about the messy love lives of the Bloomsbury set,
however, he is finally given a wonderfully meaty role and seizes the
opportunity to use all the reserves of talent at his disposal. His
performance is so good that the film, about the infatuation of the
painter Dora Carrington with the homosexual writer, could as easily have
been called Lytton. This is not to disparage Emma Thompson's performance
as Dora, but simply to recognise Pryce's achievement.
''I think the Bloomsbury set was a fairly incestuous group of people,
although I am sure that kind of thing still goes on,'' he said. ''An
enormous amount has been written about them, including Michael Holroyd's
extensive biography of Strachey, and there are lots of letters and
photographs which survive which I read when preparing the part. But the
bulk of the work was done by Christopher 20 years ago when he started to
write the script. A film has to exist from the text and it is all there.
It is, after all, for people who do not know very much about Lytton or
Dora.''
Strachey is said to have had a very distinctive way of speaking, so
how did Pryce devise the voice he affects for the role, since there are
no recordings extant of him? He said he was told that Strachey's voice
was high-pitched and sing-song and had tried to catch the essence of a
very particular peculiar way of speaking. ''I used two voices, that of
Malcolm Muggeridge, whom I used to impersonate when I was boy, who had a
very precise, academic style of speech, and that of Ned Sherrin, because
of his witty manner, as my sources. Put the two together and you get my
Strachey.
''I do not think Strachey was a happy man -- by his own admission. I
believe, however, if he had not died when he did his contribution to
literature and historical writing would have been greater. This film
redresses the balance, because it should stop people thinking he was a
dry old stick without a funny bone in his body. Eminent Victorians,
after all, was the Look Back in Anger of its day. It caused an enormous
sensation.''
As to how accurate he and Thompson are, Frances Partridge, the widow
of Carrington's husband, Ralph -- the couple had a peculiar menage a
trois with Strachey for many years -- is still alive, in her nineties,
and has seen the film. ''She saw it reluctantly, but was very
complimentary about it afterwards,'' he said. ''She wrote to Emma saying
that when she saw me appear for the first time as Lytton she had gasped.
It was very moving to be told that.''
He believed Strachey was ''simply irresistible'' to Carrington and,
that to work out why, one had to go back to her relationship with her
father, which had been difficult. She had been a problem child. It was a
case of someone wanting the impossible.
Pryce made Carrington last summer, immediately before he started
rehearsals for the musical Oliver, in which he plays Fagin, currently at
the London Palladium. He had been doing a lot of film work and that
return to the theatre was deliberate, but now all he wants, when he
leaves the production in a few weeks' time, is a good rest. He had no
immediate plans, he said. But there was another film in the offing.
Later this summer he starts work again for Christopher Hampton who is to
direct his second film -- Joseph Conrad's The Secret Agent about
anarchists in London at the beginning of the century. His co-stars will
be Bob Hoskins, Patricia Arquette and, making his first British film,
Gerard Depardieu. It is good company to keep.

William Russell explains why Elizabeth Hurley should face up to the
fact that her future rests with Estee Lauder
''GARBO talks!'' Elizabeth Hurley acts! The former happened, the
latter, alas, looks unlikely to ever occur, the not-so-poor girl
remaining Hugh Grant's lady, she who wears dresses which make headlines.
In this tacky, convoluted movie, Mad Dogs and Englishmen, in which she
stars as Antonia, a promsicuous Sloane Ranger, Elizabeth is oddly given
nothing of note to wear, although at one point we do get to see what
holds those dresses up.
Since Antonia is also a smack addict, one is driven to wonder what
those nice people at Estee Lauder will make of it all since such
behaviour is hardly what one wants associated with the face of the
nineties.
Written and directed by Henry Cole, the film is clearly intended to be
taken seriously. Mr Cole has disclosed that as a former heroin addict
from a comfortable background he was trying to make a largely
autobiographical thriller exposing the hypocrisy of the privileged in
British society, the violence of the criminal world, and the expediency
of the police when dealing with such people.
Joss Ackland, who also stars in the film, said it was important to him
because his son died of drug addiction and it brought the problem to the
attention of the public. That the result should be a mess -- not all it
is cracked up to be -- is a matter for regret.
Antonia is the daughter of a wealthy, stately home owning baronet
(Frederick Treves) who has taken to drugs, which means we get lots of
scenes with Ms Hurley locked in the lavatory heating bits of silver
paper containing powder and sniffing the resulting fumes.
Her supplier, Tony Vernon-Smith (Jeremy Brett) is a decadent Chelsea
resident who throws naughty parties and also corrupts young girls,
especially Sandy (Louise Delamere) who lives with her stepfather, a top
policeman called Stringer (Joss Ackland).
Stringer, in spite of being old enough to be Sandy's father, is in
love with her and she returns his interest with interest, so when he is
told by his estranged wife (Claire Bloom) that Sandy is his natural
daughter the news sends him round the twist. He gets even madder when he
finds out what Vernon-Smith is up to with Sandy.
Mike Stone (C Thomas Howell in ripped blue jeans revealing a fine pair
of knees) is a young American bike messenger who falls in love with
Antonia and tries to mend her ways. When Stringer finds Antonia waiting
for Vernon-Smith to buy drugs he rapes her -- the scene is so badly shot
and edited he must be the first rapist in history who does not unbutton
let alone drop his trousers -- and throws her unconscious body in the
Thames, before going totally mad.
But Antonia survives. She must be disposed of and Stringer sends two
hit men to the stately home to do the job, after which lots of people
get killed before Antonia and Mike end up in one another's arms.
At one point somebody says to Ms Hurley -- ''Have you any concept
what's happening to you?'' I doubt it, or she and all concerned would
have headed for the hills rather than complete the film. Later on Mike
tells her -- ''You're unbelievable.'' Got it in one, man.
I once incurred the wrath of Mr Grant by suggesting his performance in
Polanski's Paper Moon meant he had a great career ahead on the front
cover of knitting patterns. Ms Hurley, who has acquired a lot of his
mannerisms -- maybe he rehearsed her lines with her -- has a great
future with Estee Lauder, who would be well advised to buy up all the
prints pronto.
Billy Zane, one of the best bald baddies around, has great fun in
Tales From the Crypt: Demon Knight as The Collector, a fiend from hell,
who pursues Frank Brayker (William Saddler) through Texas. The chase
ends with Brayker besieged in a motel, once a church, along with an
assortment of peculiar folk including a whore, a woman convict, a wino,
a sacked postal worker, a small boy and the manageress of the motel.
The variegated supporting cast is duly dispatched to that bourn from
which no man returns in a variety of novel ways as The Collector tries
to obtain from Brayker a sacred object once said to have contained the
blood of Christ. The most frightful tosh, based loosely on the 1950s
comic books and the television series, it delivers pretty much
everything in the way of gruesome thrills and chills people who enjoy
horror movies want.
The film of the week, however, is Grosse Fatigue, GFT tonight at 8.30,
which should on no accounts be missed by anybody who enjoys French
cinema and wants a good laugh. A second chance, for those who live in
Edinurgh, or can afford to take the train there, comes at Filmhouse on
Sunday.
Shown at Cannes last year to acclaim, it stars Michel Blanc, who wrote
and directed it, as himself, and Carole Bouquet as herself. Blanc's
problems start when he finds himself being impersonated and then
replaced by his double. Will the real Michel Blanc stand up?
The resulting witty look at his identity crisis features the cream of
French cinema in cameo roles, including Philippe Noiret and Josiane
Belasco. While in many ways an in-joke, this examination of the problems
stardom brings is a good one. Just why it has not been released here is
anybody's guess, although the fact that Hollywood allegedly acquired the
remake rights may have something to do with it.
Grosse Fatigue is part of French weekends staged in both cinemas --
both programmes also include Jacques Demy's enchanting musical Les
Parapluies de Cherbourg starring Catherine Deneuve when she was young
and beautiful and not ''an ageless icon of the French cinema'' which is
just a other way of saying she does not look her age although we know it
is great.
GFT also has Gerard Depardieu in Yves Angelo's impressive, if
strangely bloodless account, given the subject matter, of Blazac's Le
Colonel Chabert, which I have already reviewed, for the rest of the
week. Those who go there tomorrow evening will also hear An Announcement
at the Institut Lumiere event which opens the weekend about which my
lips are sealed -- but in future we must all grovel when approaching Ken
Inglis, assuming we dare speak to him without being spoken to first.
The ubiquitous Tim Roth, whom I erroneously said played a man called
Sinclair, not Cunningham, in Rob Roy -- thank you, Anne MacDuff for
spotting the error, and the fact that I said Andrew Keir played the Duke
of Atholl not Argyll, I must have been in a stupor -- stars in Little
Odessa, a gangster movie which takes itself very seriously indeed and,
like the wrath of God, passeth all understanding. For tiny Tim fans
only.

HE WAS, and still is, a man without a vote. Yet he has lived in South
Africa for over one-quarter of a century, his wife and his home are in
Durban, and he will almost certainly spend the rest of his days in his
adopted country. Jim Chisholm is white, over 50, and remains British --
there are an awful lot of folk like him.
''I used to say to my African friends, of which I am pleased to say
there are many, that we were all in the same boat with no say in who was
in the Government. But in saying it I knew I had a choice that was not
open to them.
''Now they have the vote. And soon, under new legislation, I will be
able to take part in local elections. I am still not going to swop my
passport, though.''
Jim is a Peebles lad. After school he attended the Scottish College of
Textiles in Galashiels, where he studied with the Scotland rugby team
manager, Duncan Paterson, and qualified as a dyer and finisher. But the
textile trade in the UK and the woollen business in the Borders were
falling on hard times.
He was working in Glasgow when the opportunity to go to South Africa
emerged. Jim had already been to the republic on holiday, had loved what
he recorded on his old Standard 8 camera, and took little persuading
that his family's future -- he had a son and a daughter by then -- was
in the sunshine.
Did the political situation not concern him? ''It may seem strange to
say so but to be quite honest it did not. The colour of people's skin
means nothing to me. Before I even came here I had played cricket with
many of the Pakistani team and thoroughly enjoyed their company.
''In Durban most of the guys I worked with were Zulus or Indians; we
got along fine. Some of the African lads were from the country and
couldn't read.
''Yet they were quick to learn and they responded to kindness. In
general terms I would say the British expats were well liked, we had
good relations with all the races.''
Jim Chisholm ran the company soccer side. It contained a couple of
whites, two Indians, and the rest were black. They had to play all their
games in the sprawling townships.
Because of the colour of his skin Jim was required to obtain a permit
to take his team into squalid camps. ''And I had to promise not to drink
with them afterwards -- a vow I broke at every possible opportunity, we
always wound up in shebeens.''
So, when the change came, when Mandela was released, when President F
W de Klerk became Deputy President, when a black-dominated Government of
national unity was installed, when apartheid was finally laid to rest,
what were the emotions of this Scotsman? ''Initially, astonishment. We
all knew there had to be alterations to the system, that they were long
overdue, but the speed of change was quite breathtaking. I had never
heard of a politician (de Klerk) who willingly sacrificed his own job.
''I have an enormous admiration for the man, and for President
Mandela. Because of the attitude of both of them the transition has been
more successful than any of us could have hoped.
''Frankly, we all wish both of them could work in harmony forever.''
But hang on, Jim, I cut in, you can't be telling me that everything in
the South African garden is smelling of jacaranda. I see the unemployed
sitting on the streets and in the parks, I've been to several townships,
I read every day that the society is becoming ever more violent, that
Johannesburg is labelled the murder capital of the world.
''Sure, we have problems,'' he conceded. ''A hungry man is an angry
man and we have a lot of them.
''The Government's redevelopment programme is giving priority to
non-whites in the job market, and that is making some impression. You
cannot go too fast down that road without hurting the economy.
''Housing is being improved and there is a genuine attempt to improve
the lot of the poor. That is going to cost people like me money, a
responsiblity which I accept.
''Yes, crime does worry many people. I was mugged myself one night
because I stupidly walked to my hotel. The Government must not be seen
to be soft on this issue.
''But let us not get it out of proportion, either. I was in Zurich
recently and the drug problem is enormous. Would you like to walk
through areas of some British cities late at night?''
Jim Chisholm is an optimist. He has pals in every section of the
community, his wife teaches at a Muslim school.
They know they have a good standard of living -- there are eight
bedrooms in his Durban home -- that this country has a wonderful
climate, that they are very fortunate. But he is prepared to put quite a
lot back.
These days he is export manager for a company called Texchem, which is
the oldest manufacturer of textile auxiliaries in Southern Africa. Among
their 120 employees are many representatives of the new nation.
''I like the African. Most of them have a most cheerful disposition
and they have surprisingly little rancour about how they have been
treated by the whites.
''This has the potential of being a great country if we can all work
together. What is the alternative? Sport will help -- look at the way
the country has come behind the rugby team.
''I am not a rich man by international standards. When I came here the
exchange rate was two rand to the pound. Today it is nearly six. So
what? I have had a grand time and I have absolutely no regrets.''
Tell me, I posed as the final question, do you consider yourself as
South African or British? ''Scottish''. We always were a law unto
ourselves.

Elizabeth Buie investigates the volunteer phenomenon, and scotches a
few myths on the way
ASK most people their idea of a typical volunteer and they will
probably describe a middle-class, middle-aged housewife who collects for
the Red Cross, or pours tea for the WRVS.
She is something of a stereo-type -- an earnest, clubby sort of woman,
with just a hint of the Joyce Grenfell about her.
Of course, there are bound to be volunteers who do resemble this
''typical'' volunteer. But in reality, one half of the UK's adult
population undertakes voluntary work of some kind in the course of a
year -- and that certainly accounts for a lot more people than the
aforementioned category.
Volunteers Week UK is intended to focus attention on all the people
who give up their time and energy either for other people or for a
cause, for no financial reward. It brings in the three main strands that
constitute voluntary work:
* The philanthropists -- who chose to use their abilities to help
others in need.
* The activists -- a strand of volunteering which sprang from the
solidarity of the co-operative and Labour movements and has now filtered
down into community groups fighting various corners, from banning
incinerators to keeping schools open.
* And the mutual aid, self-help organisations -- the classic examples
of which are the playgroup movement, built by mothers who got together
to provide pre-school opportunities for their own children and then
broadened out to provide support and advice to others in a similar
situation, and the support groups for families of and sufferers of a
variety of illnesses.
Liz Burns, director of Volunteer Development Scotland, has her
volunteering roots in the playgroup movement which she joined when she
gave up work to have children. Eventually she became the organisation's
Scottish chairwoman and recently served as its president.
In 1983 she became the first employee of Volunteer Development
Scotland, an umbrella group for all voluntary groups which gives advice
and support and co-ordinates local volunteer bureaux whose own task is
to match potential volunteers and groups in need of volunteers.
Talking ardently about how we must value our volunteers, she is the
first to praise the work of those who do match the stereotypical image,
women for whom volunteering was very often the only viable route open to
self-esteem, self-development and satisfaction at a time when other
avenues were closed. Through voluntary work, these women could take on
very responsible positions and create the kind of role for themselves
that society found acceptable.
Changes in employment, sexual dynamics, and family relationships have
altered much of that. Nowadays, the women who naturally became involved
in charitable and philanthropic organisations are often obliged to
remain at work while bringing up their children, and therefore do not
have time to devote to helping other people.
Instead, a new source of volunteers is being tapped -- people who have
taken early retirement and still have the energy and the interest to
take on new commitments. Life in the 1990s in some ways militates
against voluntary work -- those in work often work longer hours, those
out of it often have the responsibilities of either looking after an
elderly relative or grandchildren.
Other leisure pursuits compete with the ethos of helping others, or
committing oneself to a cause. On the face of it, with more people
unemployed, voluntary work should offer that section of the community a
fulfilling way of spending their time. But research suggests that
unemployed people are less likely than those in employment to become
volunteers, and the longer they are unemployed, the smaller the chances
of their becoming involved. It is all about loss of self-esteem and lack
of access to networks, suggested Mrs Burns.
Employers may need to revise their ideas and start to recognise
voluntary work as real work experience and not ''women's work''.
As a society we may also be relying too much on our volunteers. When
the Welfare State was created and state provision was made central to
it, one might have thought that there would have been less emphasis
placed on the voluntary sector -- but, in practice, that did not happen.
The statutory services involved volunteers to a huge extent. Adult
education, youth services, hospitals, social work agencies (such as day
centres) -- all involved volunteers in large numbers.
Now, the pattern is changing again. Partly because of the swing
towards welfare pluralism, the State, particularly at local government
level, is moving from being a provider to being a purchaser of services.
It is looking to the voluntary sector to provide these services, among
others.
But the problem is that people may not be volunteering in large enough
numbers to provide the services that have come to be expected. Young
people in particular are expressing huge concern about environmental and
conservation issues and organisations in that sector are having
relatively little difficulty attracting volunteers.
In stark contrast is the care in the community sector -- and
organisations like Volunteer Development Scotland realise they must find
out more clearly who they can rely upon to volunteer for this type of
work.
''It may be older people, but they may also want to save the world. Or
it may be that we have to review where resources get invested,'' said
Mrs Burns.
Speaking in a personal capacity, she added: ''It may be that in the
long-term we need to look at how care in the community is to be
delivered if current assumptions about volunteer involvement do not
prove well-founded.''
To some extent, gaps in the community are now being filled by the
business community, as employers -- both in the public and private
sectors -- realise that they need a healthy community just as much as a
healthy community needs healthy businesses. This is particularly true of
some of the large employers who are now embarking upon what they call
''community investment programmes'', in which they look at ways of
encouraging and supporting employees to become involved in volunteering.
Some of the early work on community investment ideas began in the
1980s, but only developed in Scotland in the 1990s.
''When it began in the 80s, part of it would have been about the
caring face of capitalism, but also about the beginnings of a
recognition by the business sector of how dependent they were on the
community and people's perceptions of their companies and
organisations,'' said Mrs Burns.
But all this talk of community -- does it not echo the Labour leader
Tony Blair's talk of community and responsibility? Well, yes and no. The
Labour Party's Commission on Social Justice may have come up with
proposals for a community service programme aimed primarily at young
people, but Volunteer Development Scotland is decidedly ''cautious''
about it.
''We are cautious,'' said Mrs Burns, ''because experience suggests
that very large-scale universal programmes have very limited success,
that while there is no doubt that a certain approach can work at a
certain time with fairly limited numbers of people, that does not in
itself mean it can be translated into a universal programme.''
She explained that a pamphlet on national community service published
by the same commission talked about a scheme in which young people would
be paid a fixed sum.
''That is not volunteering. That is not to say it may not be a good
thing, but it confuses the picture to talk about it as if it were
volunteering -- so we are very cautious.''
She is cautious too as she awaits the publication on Tuesday of the
Government's new strategy up to the year 2000 for volunteering. She
hopes it will recognise the importance of volunteers and the need for
resources to be invested in them. But she warns the Government must
become aware of the impact of some of its policies -- local government
reorganisation, for instance, and changes in the benefit system.
Nevertheless, she is pleased that the Scottish Office has recently
provided direct funding for four new volunteer bureaux in Scotland -- in
Stirling, Dumfries, Stornoway, and a mobile unit in Highland region --
to supplement its existing network of 35.
Because so much volunteer work is done quietly, behind the scenes, it
is often easy to discount its importance, even in economic terms -- 100
million hours a week in the UK of volunteering input, and #4100m of
added value to the social economy in a year.
''But volunteering is not about cutting the wage bill, it is about
services, activities, just the basic social fabric that would not be
there if it was not given on that basis,'' said Mrs Burns.
''There is this other value of it -- this is how people participate in
their society and get a sense of ownership about it. It helps to build
the skills of being participative and therefore being active in a
democracy. That for me is one of the core values.''
* ANNE MARIE DAMER, 27, is a higher grade postwoman with the Royal
Mail. Anne Marie is a member of one of the Royal Mail's community action
teams.
Her team has done a lot of work at a special school in the north of
Glasgow, including putting on a pantomime for the children -- many of
whom come from families with problems -- cleaning up a pond for them,
and building a path.
''I am learning things I would never have attempted before.
''I used to do some voluntary work with mentally handicapped children
when I was at school and got interested that way.
''The school we work in is for children with family problems and the
play area was just no good.
''You try to make their lives as good as possible when they are at
school. It was good to see them enjoying what we had done for them.
''I think it has been good for the Royal Mail to a certain extent, but
I am not really interested in doing this for the company -- I enjoyed
doing it. It was in our own time, usually at weekends.''
* ROSEANNE MELEADY, 38, is a student and a volunteer with the Scottish
Association for Mental Health in Glasgow.
Currently studying social sciences at college, for the past
two-and-a-half years she has given information and emotional and
practical support to callers to the association.
''They asked if I was interested in staying on. I was interested in
the work and the clientele and decided to give up one day a week.
''I find it a satisfying thing that you are helping somebody who very
often desperately needs that advice, and that you are able to put people
in the right direction for help and counselling.''
* EVELYN ROBERTSON, 43, is an administrative assistant in Glasgow
District Council's homeless unit. She has been a volunteer with SACRO
(Scottish Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders) for
the past eight months.
Her work involves working with offenders' families, often taking them
for prison visits, and being there to offer help and advice.
''I think I had a lot of time on my hands and I felt I was not using
it well.
''I felt I had time to give and put it to good use. It has given me a
great sense of satisfaction and made me realise that whatever my own
problems there are a lot of people who are a lot worse off than
ourselves.''
* JOHN CLUTTERBUCK, 57, is a lecturer in genetics at Glasgow
University. He has been a volunteer with Contact the Elderly for 24
years.
This is made up of a group of volunteers who use their cars to take
lonely, elderly people out once a month for afternoon tea in a number of
other peoples' homes.
''It is a very informal group and ideal for busy people because it
takes up only one Sunday a month. I just had the idea it would be nice
to be helpful to old people.
''It does give a feeling of satisfaction. One is also aware that they
are quite grateful to be taken out, so it is of mutual benefit.''
* ISLA Scott, 32, is unemployed. Isla does voluntary work for the
Women's Environmental Network (WEN) through participation in Glasgow
Environmental Action which is run by Community Service Volunteers
Scotland.
Her work involves support and outreach work and campaigning on
environmental issues affecting women's lives.
''I believe that WEN is a very appropriate organisation for women to
be involved in. It is women-centred and came out of the feminist
movement, and has a spiritual element; both areelements of my life.
''I really feel that it is my job, it is my career.''

AFTER four happy years in Scotland, the French consul, Jean-Claude
Richard, is set to move on. He is leaving Edinburgh for a post in
Uzbekistan in Middle Asia.
M Richard has been told this is a promotion but is not sure. ''I
arranged to send a pipe band to Paris for the rugby international
earlier this year and the Scots team were so inspired by the music that
they beat France. This posting to Uzbekistan may be a punishment.''
But before he leaves, Jean-Claude is determined to celebrate in some
style the 700th anniversary of the Auld Alliance. The consul is a bit of
an expert on the ancient treaty between Scotland and France.
He is often to be found betting Scots a case of champagne to a bottle
of whisky that they cannot name the date of the sealing of the Auld
Alliance. He has not lost yet. We will now spoil his fun for the last
month of his tour of duty in Scotland by revealing that the treaty was
concluded in Paris on October 23, 1295, and ratified in Dunfermline the
following February.
As part of the Auld Alliance celebrations, M Richard has organised a
competition for Diary readers in which the first prize is two Air France
tickets to Paris. To win, all you have to do is submit a story,
anecdote, or personal experience that captures the spirit of the special
relationship between Scotland and France.
Entries, marked Auld Alliance, to the Diary at the usual address.
French people are more than welcome to take part.
Not strictly
protocol
WE don't know what the Duchess of Kent must think about the
familiarity of Scottish men. She was up on royal duty at the Tennent's
Scottish Cup Final last weekend and had to go through the ordeal at the
pre-match presentation of being kissed by all the Airdrie team.
Then, just after she resumed her seat in the director's box, a fan
passed his programme over several rows of seats to the duchess with a
piece of mime which indicated that he wished her autograph. This sort of
thing is normally frowned upon on royal occasions but the delightful
duchess was happy to reach into her royal handbag for the royal pen and
append the royal signature.
The programme was duly handed back, only for the chap to shout out
that it was actually her phone number he was after.
* RUGBY World Cup Soundbite. The venerable Bill McLaren on BBC Radio
Five Live as a Tongan player was receiving treatment for an injured leg:
''He appears to be badly hurt, and what use is a hooker without a left
leg?''
Data drought
WE return to the subject of Her Majesty's Stationery Office which is
now charged with being a profit-making publishing outfit. Methinks they
are trying too hard. On the subject of one of their hot titles,
Statistical News, they had to issue this recent statement: ''We regret
that subscribers received three rather than four issues for 1994 but
this was due to a need to gather a sufficient range of interesting
articles to make publication viable.'' We could be wrong but does this
not mean that the editor of Statistical News called in his staff and
said: ''We can't print this stuff, it's too boring.''
Baa, humbug
GREAT Mailshots of Our Time: colleague John Fowler, former arts editor
of this parish, received a letter along the following lines from one
Annika Eriksson of Stockholm: ''I am writing to you to request your
support for a project that will take place in Glasgow during one day in
June 1995. The title of the project is Two Men and a Sheep and it deals,
among other things, with men and tenderness.
''You will participate anonymously together with approximately 50
other men. Your support will consist of paying #10 using the account
number 60058955 (Swedish postal giro) before June 12. In exchange, and
as a token of appreciation, you will receive a numbered and signed
photograph of the event.
''I will contact you again in early June with further information
regarding time and place.'' Strathclyde polis serious sheep sqaud have
been alerted.
Floating tribute
FURTHER news on how we are to celebrate in August the 50th anniversary
of VJ-Day, when the Second World War actually ended. Lothian region has
decided to give a #100 hand-out for lanterns to float down the Water of
Leith, honouring the dead.
The decision has provoked a nuclear reaction among Scots war veterans:
the money has gone not to them but to CND to commemorate those who died
at Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
The debate will continue on balancing the civilian deaths in these
cities as a result of the H-bombs against the million Allied troops who
would have perished in a conventional attack on Japan.
Breakdown of trust
THE Victoria Infirmary National Health Trust, which runs various
hospitals in the south of Glasgow, has on its fax pages a footnote which
borders on the officious and overbearing.
It reads: ''The information contained in this document may be
confidential and legally privileged, intended only for the addressee. If
you are not the addressee, you are hereby notified that any use or
dissemination of the information and any copying of this document is
strictly prohibited. If you are not the addressee, please immediately
notify us by telephone and destroy this document. Thank you.''
All a bit stroppy when they sent the fax in the first place. We were
informed of this by trade union official Jim Devine of Unison who spends
much of his time combating the excesses of the hospital trusts. The
Victoria trust sent him a fax by mistake.

* A DOCTOR, fed up listening to patients' excuses that they were too
far away from a gym to do regular exercise, solved the problem by
building his own gym in the surgery.
Now Dr Roy Palmer's extended surgery in the Scottish Border town of
Ecclefechan is equipped with #25,000 worth of equipment.
He is a firm believer in preventive medicine and that regular exercise
can control and help diabetes, the overweight and those with high blood
pressure.
* IF YOU'RE looking for a plaster that really sticks, but is painless
to remove, then ask for Active Strips. These new, hypo-allergenic
plasters have been specifically designed to stick to damp skin. They
contain a newly developed, long-lasting adhesive that sticks to skin
that is sweaty or not completely dry after washing. This makes them easy
to apply and pain-free to remove. Available in a choice of shapes and
pack sizes from 99 pence for a pack of 10 from Boots and leading
chemists.
* SOFT contact lens wearers no longer have to take a small battery of
bottles when they go on holiday. A new generation of one-bottle
solutions do all the work. Complete, made by the UK's leading contact
lense solution manufacturer Allergan, is now being launched in a
convenient new 120ml size, ideal for a two-week break and costing #5.49.
* SUFFERERS from severe dermatitis could be helped by hypnotherapy. A
study carried out at Barnsley District General Hospital assessed the
effect of regular hypnosis sessions on 18 adults with severe dermatitis
that was unresponsive to conventional treatment. All but one patient,
according to a report in the medical journal GP, improved immediately .
Follow-up results showed that these benefits persisted for up to two
years.
* YOUR workplace could trigger asthma. High-risk occupations include
bakers, printers, nurses, radiographers), construction workers and those
working on an electronic assembly line, according to a report in the
current issue of the medical journal GP.

There's no known cure for hay fever, but a wide variety of treatments
can make things easier for sufferers.
TEENAGERS sitting all-important exams this summer could face a
nightmare if they suffer from hay fever. They will find concentration
difficult and gritty, itching, streaming eyes will mean they are unable
to see the exam papers properly. Sufferers are apt to find their
condition dismissed as ''snuffling'', but few realise the misery they
are going through.
Hay fever affects all ages and there is no known cure. Worse, the
number suffering is set to rise, but scientists don't know why, except
that all allergies are on the increase .
The national Pollen Line, a phone service giving local pollen counts
(providing you have a touch-phone) provides a useful service giving the
pollen count, which is updated daily until July.
Professor Robert Davies, chairman of the British Allergy Foundation,
based at St Bartholomew's Hospital, says: ''Up to one in six people
suffers from it, and most will have eye symptoms. But we think the
figure could be higher, because many people do not consult their doctor.
''We know that up to 30 per cent of the population show allergic
reaction to pollen if given skin tests. A high proportion of them will
suffer some symptoms at some time in their lives.''
While it's not life-threatening it is a debiliating condition,like a
common cold -- leaving thousands of sufferers dreading the onset of
summer.
The culprit is an allergy caused by pollen reacting to antibodies in
the blood, releasing histamine. The most common allergen is grass
pollen, but tree pollen and mould spores can also cause a reaction.
This, in turn, causes the lining of the throat, nose, eyes and lungs to
swell and produce an excess of mucus and fluid.
Hay fever tends to run in families. If you are allergic your child has
a one in three chance of developing the symptoms too. Children born to
mothers who smoke during pregnancy and those born during the pollen
season are also believed to be at higher risk.
What should you do? Professor Davies says: ''Consult your doctor as
early as possible before the symptoms get a grip, and plan proper
preventive therapy. The key thing is not to sit and suffer, but to plan
before the pollen season starts.
''Arrange with your doctor a course of treatment that will block your
body's response to the pollen. If, on the other hand, you do get caught
out, go to the chemist and ask for some of the new non-sedating type of
anti-histamines.''
What can the doctor prescribe? Well, there are a number of treatments
available. Drops into your eyes can remove symptoms of allergic
conjunctivitis. Then there are nasal sprays, which are good for a runny
nose and nasal blockage.
Today there is a wide variety of products on the market to alleviate
symptoms, ranging from antihistamine-based drugs to homeopathic
remedies. Often it's a case of trying them all until you find one that's
suitable for you, or using a combination of treatments. The traditional
treatment is based on antihistamine tablets. A drawback with the
older-style antihistamine drugs is that they may cause drowsiness.
New antihistamine-based drugs are now available which are
non-sedating, work rapidly, relieving symptoms in an hour or two. Some
are available on prescription only; others, such as Clarityn, Seldane
and Pollen-eze, can be bought over the counter.
Corticosteroids are a preventive treatment and should be used
regularly from the first sign of symptoms, though you will need a
prescription from your GP first.
A major new development for hay fever is that beclomethasone
dipropionate, previously only available on prescription, can now be
purchased direct from the pharmacist. Ask for Beconase Hayfever, but
it's not suitable for children under 12.
There are a number of homeopathic remedies on the market too, and it's
worth trying them. Do remember, though, that they lose their
effectiveness if they are taken alongside conventional medicines. Among
the standard homeopathic remedies are Nelson's Pollenna and New Era.
Some people find the herbal remedy Pollinsoan helpful. We gave a
bottle to one of our columnists, Jack McLean, who suffers from hay
fever. He reported favourably. ''There's no drowsiness, and the
streaming eyes and nose have gone.'' He stressed, though, that the
symptoms are repressed rather than cured.
Other measures which may help include improving the air quality with
an ioniser. You will find a choice of at least half a dozen on the
market now. The more you pay, the better the device you get. Investing
in a hoover with a powerful filter is another option if you are a
serious allergy sufferer.
What about pollen counts? Are they useful? Yes, says Dr Jean Emberlin,
of the Pollen Research Unit. ''Pollen counts go up to 400. Most hay
fever sufferers will get an attack when it reaches 50. It's helpful to
make a diary of pollen counts and your symptoms. That way you will see
if there is a relationship.''
Weather conditions are critical. If there's rain or a strong wind, the
count is low. Dry days with a light breeze are usually followed by a
high pollent count.
Research at the British Allergy Foundation over the next 10 years will
concentrate on trying to find the drugs that will switch off the
allergic response to pollen. ''We can't get rid of pollen, so we have to
block the effect of pollen with drugs,'' says Professor Davies.
The final message is: get to your GP and plan preventive treatment
before the symptoms take hold -- and before you enter that exam room. .

We are prepared to consume almost anything, it seems, to delay the
onset of old age. But are we kidding ourselves? ELIZABETH WESTCOTT
investigates.
JUST who was responsible for getting women religiously tucking into
half a grapefruit (sprinkled with sugar, garnished with a cherry) every
breakfast, by propagating the myth of its mysterious weight-losing
properties?
Are they the same people who would have us eat 2lb of tomatoes a day
to protect us from cancer-causing pollutants? Or tell us to consume
quantities of green bananas, cold boiled potatoes and other sources of
virtually indigestible starch to banish the spectre of bowel cancer?
The point is not that these preventive measures don't have merit: of
course they might. The point is, in moments of lunacy (or perhaps true
sanity) we find ourselves doing these things. Are we really convinced of
the benefits when we embark on our daily 2lbs of tomatoes? Why do we
swallow fads like the grapefruit diet hook, line and sinker?
The answer, says Dr Geoffrey Scobie, senior lecturer in psychology at
Glasgow University, is that we are developing a preoccupation with
ageing, and to delay its onset we have a tendency to look for shortcuts.
''Rather than adopt the balanced diet advocated by doctors we tend to
look for things which are going to improve us immediately,'' he said.
''We are in a society where people are living longer, a larger
proportion of the society is older, and so we see more clearly the
consequences of ageing.
''Once old people were looked to as great reservoirs of wisdom, but
now we have other ways of making reservoirs -- libraries and so on, so
we don't need them for that reason any more.''
We are bombarded by billboard images of youthful, disease-free bodies.
Now that old age is no longer venerated, the ancient collective dream of
immortality has been discarded like an old coat. Instead, we fantasise
of eternal youth. Who among us would not stop to drink from the
sparkling, replenishing waters of that elusive fountain? And if it
happens to be a fountain of carrot juice, well so be it.
''I don't think immortality is what people want -- this life is not
that attractive. I think people want to stay as they felt at 20 until
they kick the bucket at 80,'' said Dr Scobie.
''We watch people we know who can no longer do the things we take for
granted, like writing your own name. It's those things that make eating
tomatoes or whatever it is look so attractive.
''They have some sort of scientific evidence, but our whole life is
complicated by so many factors; have longitudinal studies been done on
these things? I don't think so.''
Which brings us to the whole problem with the advice of experts. It
changes. As the health-conscious among us switch from butter to
margarine then back to butter, we are dismayed to hear of the local
centenarian who proudly and loudly proclaims he owes his long life to a
diet of bacon, scotch and 30 cigarettes a day.
Yet we struggle on, patting our cheeks with the latest miracle cream
(even though we know nothing undoes the effects of ageing) and
swallowing shark liver oil capsules to stimulate our immune systems.
Our motivation to undertake strange, faddish diets stems from two
needs, says Dr Scobie. Firstly, to improve ourselves physically or
psychologically and secondly, because the older we get the more afraid
we are of the decline.
''People are not so much afraid of death now as the process of
dying.''
An interesting point. But is it enough of a reason for spending our
lives worrying if pepper is carcinogenic, or gobbling garlic cloves by
the dozen to ward off undead bacteria? One old lady, who elected at the
age of 80 to write a list of the things she would do if she could live
her life over, included, ''I would eat more ice cream''.
A balanced diet is one thing. Grapefruit for breakfast, green bananas
for lunch, and a few pounds of tomatoes for tea, complemented by a shark
liver oil cocktail and perhaps an algae salad, is another. Excessive
tomato pigment in the system may be a safer way of colouring your skin
than sunbathing (as one overexcited professor pointed out) but really we
would all prefer to simply sit in the sun.

THROUGH your generosity we have now collected more than #40,000 for
the establishment of a special secondary investigative and care clinic
for gynaecological disorders at Glasgow's Royal Infirmary,
internationally recognised as one of the most distinguished teaching
hospitals in Britain. Our target remains #100,000 to cover equipment and
running costs, and donations have come not just from individuals but
from church groups and women's committees, friends holding coffee
mornings, book sales, dances, ceildhs, sponsored events and raffles.
If you can hold a similar event to raise money for the Foundation we
would be delighted to hear from you. Any sum, no matter how small, is
gratefully received and means a lot: for instance, if each woman reader
of The Herald gave just #1 we would be well clear of our financial goal.
Our clinic's aim is to be a centre of excellence, staffed by attentive
personnel who will counsel and ease women's apprehension about this
particularly sensitive area of medicine, and provide an informed
investigation and treatment management. The statistics on women's health
in Scotland are among the most shocking in Europe, but by supporting
this charity women themselves will be helping to save women's lives. So,
please consider making a donation to the Foundation today.
Anne Simpson.

The SAS, the eyes and ears of the British Army, is working quietly in
dangerous territory. Ian Bruce, Defence Correspondent, looks at the
service's impact so far on a warring region.
THE Special Air Service -- Britain's shadow warriors -- has been the
eyes and ears of the UK military effort in Bosnia since 1992.
Working behind Serbian lines, it has plotted gun positions, kept tabs
on the movement of troops and armour, and acted as forward air
controllers to pinpoint targets for Nato air strikes.
The outgoing UN military commander in Bosnia, Lieutenant-General Sir
Michael Rose, was in charge of 22 SAS Regiment from 1979 until 1982. He
presided over the storming of the Iranian embassy in London in 1980, and
everything in between until the end of the Falklands campaign.
As the senior military leader in Sarajevo, he had access to the
regiment's unrivalled intelligence-gathering skills within the former
Yugoslavia. But there has never been more than a single 30-strong troop
of the elite 400-man unit within the country.
One SAS trooper, Corporal Fergus Rennie, 28, was mortally wounded by
shrapnel in April last year as he manned a forward obeservation post on
the outskirts of the besieged Muslim enclave of Gorazde.
He and another colleague had twice guided US F-16 fighter-bombers,
flying from bases in Italy, in strikes against the Serbs in the two days
before they were discovered and shelled.
The first raid called down by the SAS men knocked out a tank which was
firing directly into the refugee-packed town. The second silenced an
artillery piece lobbing rounds into nearby civilian houses.
It took more than an hour for a French helicopter to reach an
emergency landing zone under fire to evacuate Corporal Rennie. But he
was too badly hurt, and bled to death on route for treatment at a
military hospital.
The French helicopter crew, themselves braving mortar rounds and
machine-gun bullets, were forced to take off before the second SAS
trooper, also wounded, could be brought to the landing zone. He
survived.
The Serbs lost their best chance of SAS scare propaganda less than
three months ago, when a four-man patrol armed with AK47 assault rifles
stopped a UN vehicle between Sarajevo and Kiseljak and arrested its
occupants.
They included one of the most senior commanders in the SAS and three
of his officers. The men, who had a single 9mm Browning pistol between
them, were on a ''look-see'' mission to reconnoitre territory and check
out the roads.
The four special forces' men were released unharmed. A UN spokesman
later conceded that they had made a snap decision, and concluded that
they were ''not here as combatants.''
All sides in the triangular Bosnian civil war claim the UN uses its
fragile right to move teams of unarmed soldiers, liaison officers, and
negotiators, known as United Nations Military Observers, behind the
lines as ''spies''.
Some of these UNMOs are now hostages. The Serbs have always maintained
that they are SAS intelligence-gatherers. They are, in fact, drawn from
the ranks of units committed to the peacekeeping mission.

A HEAVY outburst of fighting and reports that Serbs dressed as
peacekeepers had infiltrated Sarajevo, yesterday added to tensions in
the Bosnia hostage crisis.
As sentiment built to give added muscle to the trapped UN Mission,
rather than pulling it out, the Bosnia Serbs and the West appeared
intent on cooling the situation.
Bosnian Serbs offered new talks on an old offer -- releasing the
hostages in exchange for a promise of no more Nato attacks.
Meanwhile, the US sent an envoy back to Belgrade to try to bridge
differences with Serbia's president over recognition of Bosnia, and
President Bill Clinton said the US would consider dispatching soldiers
to help redeploy, not just remove, UN peacekeepers.
US Secretary of State Warren Christopher, denouncing Bosnian Serb
leader Radovan Karadzic as ''a bully'', said Washington would give help
to allies with peacekeepers in Bosnia, if they got into trouble.
However, in Sarajevo, fears grew with the renewed sounds of war.
Residents awoke to the boom of tank, mortar, and artillery rounds, as
Serbs and city defenders resumed fighting after days of relative quiet.
The battles were on Debelo Brdo, a hill south of the city centre,
which was the site of heavy fighting two weeks ago.
Fighting also resumed to the south-east, in Gorazde, where five people
were reported wounded on Tuesday.
Serbs have moved closer to government positions in the UN ''safe
area'' after taking over eight of the nine UN observation posts
abandoned or left empty by hostage-taking.
UN officials said Serbs, backed by tanks and mortars, launched an
infantry attack on the eastern bank of the Drina River, which runs
through Gorazde. But government lines apparently held.
They claimed that Serbs in French uniforms had apparently infiltrated
Sarajevo in a UN armoured personnel carrier. The Serbs seized 36 white,
UN-marked armoured vehicles, including six light tanks. They also have
dozens of other vehicles with UN markings.
UN Spokesman Alexander Ivanko spoke of additional sightings of stolen
armoured vehicles in the city, and said that security had been
increased.
Elsewhere, US envoy Robert Frasure was in Belgrade to talk to Serbian
President Slobodan Milosevic, hoping he would recognise Bosnia in
exchange for a suspension of economic sanctions on Serb-led Yugoslavia.
Seeking to break out of their diplomatic isolation, the Bosnian Serbs
offered ''urgent talks'' on a deal to release the hostages in exchange
for promises of no more bombing.
UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali recommended the Security
Council either scale down UN operations in Bosnia, or have a more robust
operation by replacing UN troops with a multinational force.
His long-awaited report to the council offered four options. He flatly
rejected two -- the withdrawal of the 22,400-strong UN Protection Force
in Bosnia, and retaining the status quo.
A third option was to provide additional force as needed to implement
the mandate. But he said this would not be appropriate.

BOSNIA yesterday said they would not play Yugoslavia in the European
men's basketball championship qualifiers in Sofia today.
Bosnian coach Hadzic Sabit said the decision, taken in Sarajevo, was
intended as a gesture of solidarity with the people of Bosnia, following
an escalation of fighting there.''We cannot play against the Serbs,
because in Bosnia they have been killing many young people,'' he added.

A SALZBURG court yesterday acquitted a Bosnian Serb of murder and
genocide in Austria's first war crimes trial involving former
Yugoslavia, but a state prosecutor immediately appealed against the
verdict.
Dusko Cvjetkovic, 27, had denied involvement in atrocities during the
sacking of the Bosnian village of Kucice in July 1992.
Judge Franz-Xaver Egger told the court that the jury, by a majority,
had acquitted Cvjetkovic of the murder of a Bosnian Moslim, named only
as Senad H. Acquittals. He was aquitted unanimously on all other
charges. A charge of arson had been dropped earlier in the week.
State prosecutor Hubert Maringgele said he was appealing against the
verdict on the instructions of the Austrian Justice Ministry, and
Cvjetkovic would have to remain in custody. A decision by the court on
the appeal is expected in a few days.
Maringgele had said he was opposed to Cvjetkovic's release because
there was a danger he could flee.
Defence attorney Guenther Stanonik complained at the way the trial had
been conducted and said a claim for compensation had been lodged.
Cvjetkovic was detained in May 1994, in Salzburg, where he had been
living as a refugee, after he was recognised in the street by a Bosnian
who alleged he was a killer.
Cvjetkovic, a native of Kucice, had been charged with killing at least
one person and sending others to a concentration camp where they were
later said to have died.
A first hearing at Salzburg's Regional Court was halted in December,
when judges refused to accept the jury's verdict -- which was not made
public. Austria's Supreme Court ordered a new trial which began in
March.

IN the report, Nursing homes inquiry demanded (May 19), Mr Jimmy Hood,
MP, states that nursing home owners put profit before patient care.
I have never heard so much rubbish. Does he hear anyone say that all
politicians are dishonest because of a few wayward members? Such remarks
only lessen the credibility of Mr Hood.
Why does he seem so intent in pursuing private nursing homes and their
owners when most of the latest bad publicity has been directed at the
residential sector?
His party has recently issued a report, Inspect or Neglect, by Rachel
Squire. From the title I assume that if a home is not inspected then it
must be neglected.
Why then does he not question why Strathclyde Regional Council run
residential homes in his own constituency that have not had an
inspection in over three years?
In private nursing homes we employ fully trained nurses, which no
residential home is allowed to employ. These professionals have a code
of conduct that requires them to report any infringements of the
regulations they see or know of to the proper authorities.
Hence it could be said that nursing homes are inspected every minute
of the year.
I would welcome Mr Hood's call to Mr Ian Lang to have an
investigation, but don't let it stop at nursing homes but let's have it
across the whole care sector, private and local-authority.
I believe that every single nursing home in Lanarkshire has full
confidence and faith in the ability of the Lanarkshire Health Board to
carry out registration and inspection of nursing homes.

HOW quaint to find that there are still, in the 1990s, those who
categorise their poets in terms of precious metals. And how touching to
find that there is someone outwith the membership of the Scottish
Education Department's CSYS English setting panel who believes that
there is anything other than iron pyrites to be mined from Coleridge's
output.
Mr Duncan Brown's letter (May 24) presents an intriguingly archaic set
of notions. Is he really unaware of the esteem in which MacDiarmid is
held by those not in thrall to the ancient prescriptions of Palgrave?
Does he really think that everything Burns wrote is a gem of poetic
achievement?
Is he really educated enough to put pen to paper, yet not enough to be
able to distinguish between the hand-me-down wisdom he has absorbed
along with a remarkable armoury of cliches, and that indefinitely
preferable quality, informed judgment?
Coleridge's ''brilliance'' appears to reach mediocrity when you have
every reason to expect it to continue on the level of McGonagall on a
bad day, and this may account for the surge of rapture induced in those
whose faculties have been dulled by addiction to the opium of Golden and
Silver poets when they encounter in Coleridge a passage of moderate
success.
Keats has many attributes, but possibly his foremost is the quality of
demonstrating, in such a poem as Ode to a Nightingale, the distinction
between achievement on his part, and mere aspiration on Coleridge's. My
surprise that anyone anywhere still reads Shelley is equalled only by my
amazement that anyone ever did.
Some of my more limited pupils have, on occasion, denounced
MacDiarmid's poetry as ''crap'', and I have little doubt that Mr Brown
will seize on their verdict as the support which he has signally failed
to attract from any more reputable authority.
To demonstrate the Brownian fallacy, I would commend the exercise of
reading Coleridge's unparalleled piece of extended doggerel, Christabel,
alongside the great early lyrics of C M Grieve; and in the hope of being
of service to Mr Brown in a more directly useful manner I would
recommend to him the study of Alan Bold's critical prose alongside his
own.
Yes, MacDiarmid wrote some bad verse, especially in his later years,
but I would confidently suggest that the proportion of bad to good to
magnificent is similar to Burns's. Having only one item of Mr Duncan's
prose to go on, I have to say that he appears to have achieved less than
either at his worst.

I WRITE to express concern about the reports (May 26) on Thursday's
proceedings in the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland by
Christopher Reekie, Lynne Robertson, and Stewart Lamont.
They concentrate entirely on the speech and activities of Cardinal
Thomas Winning and say virtually nothing about reports on other aspects
of the work of the Church of Scotland.
Inevitably we have quotes from Duncan McClements, James Weatherhead,
and Maxwell Craig. The whole thing, in my opinion, is a put-up job.
With regard to a call for a Christian gathering in the year 2000, this
is something to be disregarded. We need to get on with the preaching of
the Gospel -- the command that Jesus, the King and Head of the Church,
has given to us.

IT is always interesting to discover how others view your friends
(Stewart Lamont May 24). I have known John Bell for well over 30 years,
and would never have described him as ''the wild young man'', ''the
hippie'', or as like ''Holman Hunt's portrait of Jesus,'' but since I am
not a great lover of the English Pre-Raphaelites the latter was lost on
me.
What prompted this response was the allegation that John Bell is ''a
Luddite when it comes to microchip technology'', because the same has
often been aimed at me. As a principal teacher of art and design I was
granted minimal consultation in the acquisition of a sophisticated
computer whose value equalled 20 badly-needed easels and a decent
air-brush .
It was not (and is not) that I opposed the computer. I view my role in
school as that of one who strives to encourage individual creativity and
original thought through the medium of visual expression, and in that
process I afford the computer a status similar to the paint-brush, and
it is here that I return to John Bell.
Just as I have never met anyone incapable of drawing, I know that John
Bell believes in everyone's potential to give expression to their lives
through music, and in particular through vocal music (attend one of his
workshops -- it will astonish you).
Although I parted company with the Church of Scotland some time ago, I
remain interested and respectful enough to recognise that if the worship
of God is to be continued in any relevant form into the next millennium
it will be through the efforts of people like John L (for Luddite?)
Bell, acting as both custodian of that which is wholesome and as
catalyst in the necessary process of change, using as his raw material
the lives and talents of the ordinary.
Stewart Lamont's glib labels are less than helpful in this process.

THERE are a number of contradictions in the analysis by George
Robertson, MP, which should not go unanswered (May 30).
First, he suggests that some voters who supported the SNP in Perth and
Kinross did not support independence as the principal option, yet in a
Scotland-wide opinion poll in The Herald early this year almost half of
Labour's own supporters said they were quite happy with independence in
the medium term.
Surely this is a more fundamental finding, particularly as we are
constantly reminded that Labour's support is so high?
Secondly, Mr Robertson suggests prophetically that the SNP will be
haunted as one National Executive member said that the SNP would ''never
win independence on the back of disillusioned Tory voters''.
So what? The SNP clearly did not gain disaffected Tory voters in
Perth, yet won, though it is clear that Labour's increased support did
come partly from such Tories.
Does this not tell us that New Labour is much more closely aligned to
Old Conservative than it admits, and that the SNP is the only
left-of-centre radical party in Scotland, broadly in line with Scottish
mainstream opinion?
Thirdly, unless most political commentators are mistaken, most Labour
actions are aimed at winning over the disillusioned Tory in the South of
England, the very voter whose major gripe has been taxation by the
Conservative Government.
How is Labour going to reconcile a necessary rise in direct personal
taxation, which is acceptable to the majority of Scots, with the wishes
of those unhappy Tories in the South whose Labour vote will be cast on
the basis of annoyance at tax increases?
Any Labour Government will surely be faced with a mid-term policy and
tax dilemma, which would only lose Labour votes, and certainly
highlights George Robertson's own statement, quoted from an SNP member,
that you can't make a permanent improvement on the back of disillusioned
Tory voters.
After the Perth and Kinross by-election people hve generally accepted
that Labour improved their showing, though a bit more maturity in their
Scottish leadership would perhaps provide more balanced analysis and
give the SNP credit where it's due.

Okha, Thursday
ALEXANDRA and Sergei Rot were on the verge of killing themselves when
the rescue workers going through the ruins of Neftegorsk finally heard
their cries.
''Sergei had found a piece of glass and we were going to cut our
wrists. Dying of thirst is a terrible death,'' said Alexandra, 23, from
her hospital bed in Okha, north of the doomed town on the Russian Far
East island of Sakhalin.
The couple were saved by the back of the sofa they were sleeping on
which protected them from concrete slabs that crashed down as tremor
after tremor shook their apartment block.
''A slab fell straight on the baby and crushed her immediately,'' said
Sergei of his nine-month-old daughter. He spoke in the monotone most
survivors adopt when recounting the events which wrecked their lives.
Sergei, who moved to Sakhalin from Chechnya when he realised the north
Caucasus region was on the verge of war, kept his young wife going with
dark humour through their hours of agony.
''He said things like 'Open the refrigerator, there's caviar and eggs
inside' and 'Let's go to the shops and get something to eat','' said
Alexandra, adding that all she could do was sob.
''I thought that only our block had collapsed and that we were the
only ones left, that everyone had taken their things and gone,'' she
said.
In fact the whole oil settlement of Neftegorsk collapsed in earthquake
early on Sunday morning, trapping more than 3000 people in piles of
concrete slabs and twisted metal.
''Soon after we fell I felt drops of water on my neck. I thought it
was someone's blood. I was so afraid,'' said Alexandra. The couple were
rescued on Tuesday afternoon after being trapped for more than 100
hours.
''On the first night, we could hear people working above us but they
couldn't hear us,'' said Alexandra. ''Then on the second night, there
did not seem to be anyone.''
The couple were among 32 recent arrivals at the hospital in Okha, the
half-way house for wounded survivors from Russia's worst earthquake. It
was itself shaken by the killer earthquake and still trembled in
aftershocks yesterday.
Rescue workers pulled more survivors and bodies from the rubble of the
devastated town yesterday, but hopes were fading that many more people
could be found alive.
And before dawn today rescuers uncovered a new tragedy: the
discotheque where students celebrating their graduation were killed when
the earthquake struck.
Relatives and a handful of friends who escaped before the roof
collapsed stood by while a crane lifted the concrete slabs which had
crushed some 40 teenage partygoers during the last dance.
Police tried to control the crowd which rushed to the area as word of
the discovery spread. Several women began crying so hysterically that
doctors had to inject them with tranquillisers.
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin told a government meeting yesterday
that chances were fading of finding survivors and that rescue teams
realistically had two days' useful work left.
A correspondent for Ekho Moskvy radio station said the death toll had
risen to 529, with a further 395 injured. Authorities fear that up to
2000 people may have died after the earthquake brought down multi-storey
buildings.--Reuter.

BRITAIN'S lettuce industry, which is worth #60m a year but is in
danger of withering under planned EC laws, has been given a boost by
researchers at Aberdeen University.
Scientists in the department of medicine and therapeutics have
produced evidence that nitrate, found in foods like green vegetables,
may be beneficial to health.
For many years, scientists have thought nitrate in the diet was
harmful because it could be converted to nitrite and theoretically form
N-nitrosamines which have been linked with stomach cancer.
Nitrate is concentrated in saliva and converted to nitrite by bacteria
on the tongue. This nitrite is swallowed and reacts chemically in the
mouth and stomach to form nitric oxide.
For these reasons, water authorities have imposed strict limits on the
amount of nitrate. The EU is also threatening to impose limits on the
amount allowed in green vegetables.
The Aberdeen research, carried out over two years by a team of nine
scientists, suggests that eating foods with a high nitrate content could
do more good than harm.
Their findings suggest this is a deliberate process evolved to produce
nitric oxide in the mouth and stomach which will kill harmful bacteria
and prevent gastroenteritis and possibly dental decay.
They say laws to reduce the nitrate content may be premature,
especially as it will be costly and may discourage vegetable consumption
which has proven health benefits.

THE furore over the salary of the chief executive of British Gas,
Cedric Brown, reached its climax in one of the best attended company
annual meetings in recent years. The shareholders who turned out gave
voice to the popular sense of outrage which the pay award evoked, but
their votes were easily overwhelmed by those of the investing
institutions which own the majority of shares in the company, as indeed
they do with every large quoted British company. Yet popular disquiet
will not go away by the insistence of the British Gas chairman that it
was all a matter of inadequate presentation and that had the
explanations been ''more adroit'' matters would have been very
different. Presumably the institutions accepted this explanation, and
the supporting arguments, that the media stimulated the sense of outrage
which was reinforced by political opposition both to the privatisation
of the public utilities and to wide income differentials in society
generally.
The fact is that the salaries of top executives in all the privatised
utilities have shown an enormous rate of growth since their change of
status. This has often been augmented further by huge share options
designed to motivate their beneficiaries, but which are completely out
of line with the low-risk nature of the businesses involved. It is
certainly true that the extent of the rewards has seriously damaged the
image of the businesses involved, and may have damaged the whole concept
of privatisation. The controversy has rebounded on the Government and is
perceived as part of the climate of sleaze still persisting. But the
resentful army of shareholders was not simply mobilised by the press and
then deployed by the opposition parties. The salaries of the top
executives in the privatised utilities have risen in total by #25m since
privatisation. Brown's case was not unique but was, and remains, part of
a pattern of large additions to already large salaries common to the
utilities sector.
The argument that Brown's successor might have to be paid a huge
salary is a red herring, for equally he might not. Brown himself did his
present job successfully on a very much lower salary before
privatisation. A better argument might be that 40% of his extra income
simply flows back to the Treasury; but what the public could not
swallow, and was right to gag on, was the huge jump in a single year at
a time when British Gas was reorganising itself to meet its changed
market position by cutting jobs and making it harder for customers to
pay their accounts. It was also a jump which contrasted mightily with
the effective wage restraints for those in less favoured circumstances
whose earned incomes grew very modestly, where they grew at all.
Popular opinion does accept the need for salary differentials
generally and the need to motivate risk-takers in particular. It does
not accept the notion that running a public utility is a risky business
or that those who do the job require salaries equivalent to a lottery
win per annum. If it seems like greed it is because that is what it is.
The remuneration committees of non-executive directors responsible for
executive pay in British companies need to think harder about their
recommendations. They may, however, be part of a corporate culture which
is insensitive to how the rest of the population feels about such
matters.
The institutions which felt compelled to back British Gas yesterday
provide the greater number of the personnel who are the non-executive
directors of British companies. There is no need to advance a conspiracy
thesis to support the opinion that they are bound to share assumptions
about pay and conditions, especially top pay and conditions. It might
even seem surprising if they did not. But they are out of touch with the
rest of us all the same. Yet hardly out of touch with the utilities'
regulators, if the stories about the salary hike sought by the Gas
Regulator prove to be accurate. The timing is as maladroit as that of
Brown's, and if the actual sum involved does not nearly match his, the
percentage rumoured remains considerable. Perhaps the chairman of
British Gas will come to her aid, and blame everything on the media.

COMPANY bosses in Scotland should be given cheaper bank loans --
provided they are willing to go on training courses to teach them how to
run their firms better.
The back-to-school approach was suggested yesterday by the employers'
organisation, CBI Scotland, as part of its review of what stops Scottish
companies from becoming world beaters.
THE CBI knows that Scotland has an impressive record of producing
world-class engineers, scientists, and wealth creators. Unfortunately,
few of them actually remain in Scotland and the CBI has been
investigating whether the business climate is too hostile in Scotland,
or whether it is too difficult to obtain finance.
In general, the feeling is that banks are unwilling to take even the
smallest risk in backing small companies without charging them
horrendous interest rates -- and then quickly pulling the plug on the
company if it gets into trouble. As it is popularly put, banks are
willing to lend you an umbrella when the sun is shining but take it away
at the first sign of rain.
However, the CBI investigation, published yesterday, concludes that
banks in Scotland have a measurably better commitment than the UK
average to financing small firms.
Banks themselves have been willing to put managers through business
schools and on secondments to small firms so that they have a better
idea of the problems of budding entrepreneurs.
The widespread belief, though, is that banks and other investors
demand too high a rate of return in the short term, which hinders
long-term investment prospects. The CBI states that the only way round
this is low inflation sustainable over a long period to engender
confidence.
It points out that the UK record on that is still poor, so striving to
keep inflation down had to continue.
On specific measures, it suggests that banks should be more willing to
lend at a better price where the business managers have agreed to go on
training courses. A pilot scheme in Norwich is suggested for adoption by
Scottish banks.
Scottish Enterprise, it says, should consider setting up a special
venture capital fund to develop new products to overcome the present
development gap.
The Government also should consider further tax breaks to encourage
family members to provide capital investment in the start-up businesses
of relatives.
Solicitor Andrew Cubie, who chaired the CBI committee, said yesterday:
''For Scotland's small businesses to survive and grow, two essential
further steps must be taken. The provision of finance for start-up and
growing businesses must be improved, with more options on funding being
provided.
''And entrepreneurs need to comprehend better and then utilise the
skills and know-how required to manage their businesses more effectively
in an increasingly competitive global environment.''

Munich, Wednesday
A SPORTS car worth DM1.5m (#670,000) was reduced to scrap metal after
BMW boss Bernd Pischetsrieder drove it off the road and into a ditch.
Pischetsrieder, 47, chairman of the Munich-based car-maker which
describes its cars as ''the ultimate driving machine'', and two
passengers had minor injuries that did not require hospital treatment.
The accident happened on a remote road near Chiemsee, a lake east of
Munich, and was under police investigation.
Pischetsrieder, whose BMW group also owns the Rover car group, was
driving a BMW-powered McLaren F1 owned by BMW. The 627hp car, said to be
as close to a Formula One racer as is possible for a street car, rolled
several times after going into a ditch.
The Berliner Morgenpost newspaper reported today that only five of the
super-expensive cars were in use in Germany, and that two of them were
wrecked in the past week.
Before Pischetsrieder's accident, a Frankfurt businessman rocketing
along an autobahn at 170mph lost control and hit the central
reservation. He escaped unhurt.--AP.

PAUL Ferris, the man cleared of shooting and murdering drugs baron
Arthur Thompson junior, was jailed for three months yesterday after he
admitted the reset of a #22,000 car stolen in England.
The 31-year-old car dealer had spent 10 days in prison before being
brought to Glasgow Sheriff Court after being arrested for failing to
appear at an earlier hearing.
Sheriff Richard McFarlane refused to grant bail after defending lawyer
Peter Forbes lodged an appeal against the sentence.
Ferris, of Inveresk Quadrant, Springboig, Glasgow, was taken back to
Barlinnie pending a fresh bail bid at the High Court next week.
There was particular disquiet among police officers when, in a recent
article, a Sunday newspaper devoted considerable space to Ferris'
exploits, giving prominence to his denials that he was anything other
than a Glasgow businessman -- the euphemism applied in the technical
absence of anything stronger to Ferris' mentor, the late criminal
Godfather, Arthur Thompson senior.
Earlier this month, it emerged that Ferris was to be the subject of a
Channel 4 documentary, including an interview by
murderer-turned-journalist John McVicar. At that point, Ferris told The
Herald he regarded the documentary as an opportunity to set the record
straight and that he had ''come to terms with his life''.
Ferris pleaded guilty to the reset of a car outside his home, then at
Jagger Gardens, Garrowhill, Glasgow, on March 16 last year.
The Crown accepted his plea of not guilty to failing to appear for
trial last month.
Mrs Dawn Brock, prosecuting, said the car was one of six which had not
been returned to a leasing company.
Police received information that a car outside Ferris's home might be
one of the stolen vehicles.
Although the car had a different registration number, it was
discovered to be one of the stolen vehicles and he was charged.
Mr Forbes said Ferris had got the car from the leasing company on a
sale or return basis but unfortunately did not get any documentation at
the time.
Since then, the company had gone out of business and the man who put
through the deal could not be traced.
Mr Forbes said Ferris was still in the car trade and was also involved
in a demolition business and had other interests.
The lawyer told the court that Ferris did not think there was anything
illegal about the car and parked it outside his home.
Mr Forbes said: ''The accused has a certain amount of unjustified
notoriety and the police interest in him has been a continuing one.
''Police knew where he stayed and would drive past as part of their
beat to see what was going on and, I suspect, that was the basis for
their information. The car was in full view.
''The accused knew very well the police were paying close attention to
him, knew they toured past his door regularly, and that they must be
aware of the car.''
Mr Forbes produced a used car invoice and said Ferris had lost several
thousand pounds over the matter.
The lawyer said Ferris was anxious to regain his liberty and was due
to become engaged on June 12.
Three years ago, Ferris was found not guilty of murdering Arthur
Thompson junior.
Young Arthur's death sparked off a gang war and, on the day of his
funeral, Bobby Glover, 31, and Joe ''Bananas'' Hanlon, 23, were found
shot to death in a car in the city's east end.
Their killer has not been found.
Ferris, who had been a close friend of young Arthur for many years,
was cleared after a 54-day trial, the longest murder trial in Scottish
legal history.

NURSING staff at the State Hospital at Carstairs have been offered an
unconditional 3% wage rise, backdated to April 1, it was announced
yesterday.
In a letter to staff, Mr Dick Manson, general manager of the hospital,
said: ''The standard of care offered to our patients is better than it
has ever been. At the same time, safety has been improving and the
number of incidents has reduced. This is because our nursing staff put
safety and patient care first.
''To recognise the commitment, enthusiasm, and hard work of our nurses
in adapting to our changing working practices, we have decided, for this
year, to make the maximum pay offer of 3%.''
The State Hospital, Scotland's only secure hospital, became a health
board within the NHS after an Act of Parliament earlier this year.
Because of the nature of the patients, nursing staff are paid #2500
above the standard NHS rates.
Of the 47 NHS trusts in Scotland, three have still to make a pay offer
to nursing staff: Angus NHS Trust; Kirkcaldy Acute Hospitals NHS Trust;
and Glasgow Dental Hospital and School NHS Trust.
Scottish Office figures show the following breakdown of NHS trusts
which have made formal offers or indicated their intent to offer: three
in excess of 3%; five at 3% with no attached conditions; 27 at 3% with
conditions; and nine between 2.5% and 3%.
Mr John Lambie, head of health at Unison, said his union was still
examining the conditions attached to some of the offers.
''Some appear to be reasonably innocuous. Some insist upon a degree of
local bargaining next year, but this highlights the problems of next
year and the financial positions of the trusts, and the savings which
will be required if not this year, next year,'' he said.

Your leader and the article by Chris Holme regarding the privatisation
of care for the elderly and the almost complete secrecy surrounding this
are shocking (May 29). However, they do not tell the whole horrifying
story in Scotland.
Care for the mentally disabled in Lennox Castle Hospital and
Knightswood is about to be removed as a legal right under a cloak of
secrecy, combining right-wing politicians and social workers with a zeal
for community care.
As Alf Morris, MP, pointed out, there are no local authority homes for
the elderly and there won't be any for the mentally disabled either.
It's private means-tested care run by private companies, and who will
be means-tested and have their homes taken away? The elderly parents and
guardians for the mentally disabled. A double whammy of a sickening
kind.
Contrast the Scottish Office's openness when it wrote to every council
tenant of the new right to buy with the secrecy surrounding its moves to
remove the right of the mentally disabled to long-term health care
within the NHS.
Alf Morris's scheme for ''co-operatives'' for the elderly is a brave
effort by a sincere and dedicated person, but who will run cooperatives
for the mentally disabled?
The Tories are sinking to an unbelievable new low in this and it's
time social workers stopped co-operating with this murky policy.

I WAS astonished to read Martin Blackshaw's intemperate attack on
Cardinal Winning's allegedly ''indifferentist vision of a gathering of
'all Scottish Christians' in the year 2000'' (May 30).
While it may well be true -- at least from the standpoint of a
pre-Vatican II Roman Catholic like Mr Blackshaw -- that Cardinal
Winning's ecumenical aspirations are ''incompatible with traditional
Catholic teaching'', this observation is no less applicable to the whole
theological direction of the Second Vatican Council itself.
I would remind your correspondent that back in the 1960s Pope John
XXIII -- who was undoubtedly the greatest post-Reformation pope in the
history of the Catholic Church -- solemnly summoned the world's Roman
Catholic bishops to meet in Rome at this council for the express purpose
of bringing the Church ''up-to-date'' with the modern world.
Indeed the very papal quotations cited by Mr Blackshaw in support of
his own thoroughly reactionary -- and profoundly unecumenical -- views
provide a perfect illustration of the continuing need for this process
of modernisation -- or aggiornamento -- which the good Pope John very
wisely sought to initiate in the course of his regrettably brief
pontificate.
It is entirely to Cardinal Winning's credit that he at least seems to
be determined to continue to articulate the genuinely ecumenical vision
of the Second Vatican Council in the Scottish context.

IT IS strange that good villains should be so likeable. The Sheriff of
Nottingham is an example of how a memorable one can overshadow even the
hero. When Kevin Costner played the lead in Robin Hood, Prince of
Thieves, for instance, he discovered that Alan Rickman, the Sheriff, had
all the best lines, and demanded that the script be modified. In real
life, sadly, the sheriff's role does not seem to be so attractive, and
has just escaped being unfilled for the first time in 800 years. Four
Labour members of Nottingham's city council declined to be nominated,
and the situation was only saved when Roy Greensmith, a retired
railwayman, was reluctantly persuaded to accept the honour.
Sherlock Holmes's long-time adversary, Professor Moriarty, was perhaps
the best kind of villain. His crimes were vicious enough for Holmes to
describe them as ''diabolical'' and Dr Watson to refer to them as
''unutterable infamies''. Yet he seems to have been a scholar and an
art-lover. According to one theory, his chair of mathematics may even
have been at a Scottish university.
Sax Rohmer created a similar evil genius in Dr Fu Manchu, and he, too,
was popular enough to make a comeback in 1957. As we recall, however,
neither Fu Manchu nor Dr Moriarty, apart from the fateful scuffle with
Holmes at the Falls of Reichenbach, was personally involved in violence.
As with Blofeld, James Bond's nastiest adversary, the actual killing is
carried out by characters like Oddjob. Bond himself, curiously, deals
out far more destruction than his opponents, and the higher his tally of
corpses, alas, the more cardboard does his character become.
That a plot demands far more than a succession of murders has become
clear with the film Natural Born Killers. This depicts no fewer than 52
killings, enough to delay its British showing for three months, but even
these, say critics, add up to two hours of total boredom. To be a really
good villain, like Moriarty or the Sheriff of Nottingham, you need as
much personality as the hero.

Ankara says the treaty virtually turns the Aegean Sea separating the
two feuding neighbours into a Greek lake and has threatened to go to war
if Athens actually extends its waters.
The international treaty was backed by all Greek parties and was
ratified unanimously by voice vote. The Socialist government can now
extend the territorial limit from its present six miles at a moment's
notice.
Greece has not said it will extend its waters but has made clear it
has the right to do so at any time.
This has prompted angry reactions from Turkish officials and concern
among Western diplomats about increasing animosity between the two Nato
allies.
More than 60 countries have ratified the convention, which was signed
by Greece in 1982 but had not been ratified by the 300-seat
Parliament.--Reuter.

SCOTTISH Secretary Ian Lang said yesterday he thought it ''perfectly
possible'' that both the Fort William sleeper and Motorail services
might be resurrected once British Rail was privatised.
Mr Lang was speaking in Inverness yesterday where he opened the
Scottish Tourist Board's new office. He said he could make no comment on
the appeal by the British Railways board against Lord Kirkwood's
reprieve for the Fort William service, due to be heard in the Court of
Session today.
However, he did say: ''I would fully anticipate that, once we can get
British Railways out of the present arrangements which have been so
unsuccessful over the last 45 years or so, and into the private sector
with new resources coming in; new enterprise; and new commitment to
making them a success, then we will see building on that basic guarantee
(the passenger service requirement) a new, more creative and relevant
service for the Highlands and the rest of Scotland.''
Mr Lang said that only something like 7% of Highland tourists came by
train, of that a small proportion would go to Fort William, and a
smaller proportion still on the sleeper service but he recognised that
Scotland and the Highlands had to be seen to be accessible by a range of
transport methods.
However, when asked whether he anticipated the new private finance
being used to restore services previously cut, Mr Lang said: ''It is
perfectly possible. There is already interest from the private sector in
reviving various steam services that British Rail are not contemplating
continuing. I would anticipate there would be a lot of creative and
encouraging development from the private sector.''
When asked specifically about the Fort William sleeper and Motorail
services, Mr Lang said: ''I wouldn't discount anything, not at this
stage.''
Earlier, Mr Lang opened the STB's new Inverness office, Thistle House,
saying it was yet another significant milestone in the implementation of
the review of tourism support which he had commissioned in 1992.
''The location of these offices here in Inverness is, of course, quite
deliberate. For a start, tourism is the most important industry in the
Highlands and Islands. It accounts for 20,000 jobs, some 20% of the
total workforce, and generates some #500m of expenditure in the area.
''When I say that the value of tourism per head of population in the
Highlands and Islands is four times greater than the figure for Scotland
as a whole, you can readily appreciate its significance.''
Mr Lang, however, later made itclear that he would not intervene to
help the new Highlands and Skye area tourist board find #100,000 worth
of start-up costs. So far, it has been promised only #6000, from
Highland Regional Council.
Meanwhile, Highland region is prepared to take all necessary further
steps to defend threatened rail services such as the Fort William
sleeper.
Council convener Duncan McPherson was speaking yesterday before he
left for Edinburgh to attend today's hearing in the Court of Session.
He said: ''No matter the outcome of the appeal, this court action
cannot in itself guarantee the future of the West Highland sleeper.
''The extent of the public support is such that, as transport
authority, we feel obliged to take whatever further steps are reasonable
to fight for the retention of this and other services in the
Highlands.''

Ian McConnell looks at the growth of the Candy Group and the
implications of its proposed acquisition of Hoover
CANDY Group, which is acquiring Hoover Europe, has come a long way
since two of its founding family put their heads together to produce
Italy's first washing machine in a back shed. Enzo Fumagalli first set
eyes on a washing machine in the United States, during his time as a
prisoner of war.
These labour-saving devices had not even been heard of back home and
his decision to produce them was the spark which led to the creation of
an international household-appliances giant.
Memorising the details of the wondrous contraption, he returned to
Italy and advised his brother, Eden, an engineer, on the construction of
the novel device.
Fifty years on, Candy has notched up another milestone with its first
move into the vacuum-cleaner business, having built up a turnover of
$800m (#500m) from the sale of washing machines, refrigerators, and
cookers.
The company, based near Milan in northern Italy, has a workforce of
4000 and will have an extra 3000 employees on its payroll when the
Hoover acquisition is completed. In an increasingly competitive European
appliance market, the latest move by Candy, whose strategy is one of
buying reputable brands and keeping them intact, would appear to be a
shrewd one.
The power of the Hoover name is unquestionable, as illustrated by the
fact that it is still the commonest generic term for all brands of
vacuum cleaner.
Furthermore, Candy's latest acquisition appears well timed. The
white-goods market in Europe, where about 40 million major appliances
are sold annually, should enjoy growth of up to 4% in the current year
as continental countries follow the recovery seen in the UK.
The proposed acquisition gives Candy, a private company gradually
moving into the hands of the third generation of the Fumagalli family,
an important foothold in northern Europe. Although it entered the UK in
the early eighties and now employs nearly 500 people at its Kelvinator
factory in the Wirral, Cheshire, the Hoover acquisition is a giant step.
During the past 15 years there has been rapid consolidation in the
household-appliances industry and the addition of Hoover Europe will
provide a major boost to Candy's market share.
Sales of Hoover products have been held back in some parts of Europe
because, as part of Maytag Corporation of the US, the UK-based
subsidiary could not offer adequate servicing support to customers.
Candy, with its production presence in Italy, Spain, and France,
believes it can successfully boost Hoover's penetration of Europe and
other overseas markets. Meanwhile, Hoover will spearhead Candy's drive
into the floorcare products business.
Speaking from the company's headquarters in Italy, managing director
Arrigo Arrigoni summed up the strategy of Candy: ''We intend to preserve
the identity of Hoover, not only as a brand but as a company. An
advantage for Candy Group is the greater know-how Hoover has in the
floorcare business, particularly with the factory in Cambuslang.''
Although still well behind Swedish-German group Electrolux AEG, by far
the biggest player with a 26% market share in Europe, the addition of
the vacuum-cleaner factory at Cambuslang and the major appliances
operation at Hoover Europe's headquarters at Merthyr Tydfil in Wales
will allow Candy to snap at the heels of other larger competitors.
Current analysts' figures give Candy a 6% share of the European market
but the company believes it is nearer 8%.
With the addition of Hoover Europe boosting Candy's turnover by 50%,
the Italian company will certainly be closer to Germany's Bosch-Siemens,
with a 16% share, and Italy's Whirlpool, which acquired the Philips
business in the late-eighties and has a 13% share.
After Whirlpool comes another Italian company. Merloni, with its
Ariston and Indesit product range, has a share of about 10%.
French-Italian group Brandt EM, formed by the merger of Thomson and
Ocean, has 9%.
Although GEC Hotpoint is a big name in the UK, its European market
share of 5% is actually less than that of Candy.
Taking in another German player with about 4% of the market, about 90%
of European sales are claimed by the major manufacturers of fridges,
freezers, washing machines, dishwashers and cookers.
Seven years ago the big producers commanded only about three-quarters
of the European market. In 1980, their share was only 45%.
Candy, whose chief executive officer is now a third-generation
Fumagalli, Silvano, has an industrialist rather than purely financial or
entrepreneurial philosophy.
The management of Hoover Europe, with any future problems from the
free-flights promotion fiasco probably left behind at Maytag, will be
helped to develop the business by Candy, so long as they continue to run
it profitably.
Six members of the Fumagalli family, keen to get to know the Hoover
management team, met with them in London on Tuesday night for fairly
intensive discussions.
Candy's $170m (#106m) takeover of the European business of Hoover is
being compared by some to the acquisition of Rover by BMW.
Hoover, like Rover, is strong in the UK but its acquisition by Candy
is viewed as giving it critical mass on the Continent.

AS a former Treasury economist, Clare Spottiswoode could have expected
to spend her working life without a mention in the press.
Then, surprising many, she was appointed 18 months ago as Director
General of Gas Supply -- the Government-appointed industry regulator who
would decide the limitations on what British Gas could charge its
customers, and how competition could be introduced into the industry.
As the first woman to be appointed as a regulator, it was almost
inevitable that she would be the victim of gossip on the one subject
which often dogs successful women -- sex.
Someone leaked to the press the unfounded accusation that she had an
affair with the civil servant who recommended her for the job.
Apparently, she had not only gone abroad to two conferences with him,
but she had actually sent him a bunch of flowers when she got the job --
proof positive in the minds of small men whose only chance of receiving
flowers from women would be on top of their coffins.
She faced the humiliation of having to deny the rumour to the press at
the same time as being questioned on her job by the Commons Select
Committee on the Environment.
It was suggested that the leak may even have come from someone in
British Gas itself, keen to trim her enthusiasm to open up the gas
market to other companies.
Next came yesterday's claim that she had applied to the Department of
Trade and Industry to have her salary upped from #70,000 to over
#100,000 because her job had expanded so much.
The timing could not have been worse, coming the same day British Gas
bosses faced shareholders over their huge salary hikes. Again there was
suspicion someone in British Gas leaked the story to deflect criticism.
Labour's industry spokesman Brian Wilson immediately accused her of
following British Gas bosses in the ''rush to the trough''.
Certainly, her claim at a time when the Government was pushing for a
3% pay limit in the public sector suggests she lives in a rarified
atmosphere. And coming when British Gas bosses themselves are under
attack for pay rises, it confirms in many people's minds her astonishing
naivity.
Initially, when she took the job, the mother-of-four attempted to
court the press. As a woman in a man's world, the publicity was
inevitable. Her unusual business background added to the interest.
As Clare Spottiswoode's father worked abroad, she attended 11 schools
before reaching Cheltenham Ladies' College where her ability in maths
was outstanding.
At Clare College Cambridge, where she was one of the first female
undergraduates, she switched from mathematics to economics, and was then
awarded a scholarship to Yale University in America for further study.
On her return, she joined the Treasury, where she might have remained
if she had not committed that peculiar sin of women of getting pregnant.
Her bosses seemed less than sympathetic, and so she left to form her own
firm, importing from Thailand.
While rearing her children, she sold the business and formed a
computer software firm with her sister called, rather unimaginatively,
Spottiswoode and Spottiswoode. That too was sold, and while casting
around for something to do, she contacted a firm of headhunters to put
her on their books.
At the same time, the headhunters were drawing up a shortleet to
replace Sir James McKinnon as the gas regulator.
A woman was wanted for the list with business experience and knowledge
of Whitehall. The Thai gift trade may not have put her in the
multinational tycoon bracket, but few women were, and so at the age of
41, she was listed.
Her enthusiasm for the free market, intellectual strength, and sheer
gusto won the day, and she was appointed.
What they appeared to have overlooked was her lack of tact. When
quizzed by the Select Committee on an environmental levy placed on gas
bills by her predecessor, she stated that Sir James had acted illegally
in introducing it.
Sir James is one of those old fashioned Scots businessmen of
impeccable rectitude. To accuse him of acting illegally won no friends
for Ms Spottiswoode, who returned to the committee to confess she had
got her facts wrong.
Nor did she take a populist view when she was asked her opinion on the
huge pay rises for British Gas bosses. In her honest way, she bucked
public opinion by plainly stating the truth that the rises would barely
cost each customer half a penny a year. She did not believe her role as
regulator should include setting pay rates for British Gas bosses.
Customers would benefit far more if she did her job by saving customers
one per cent on the formula for capping gas price rises rather than
footering with pay rates.
All true of course, but not what the public wanted to hear. Her view
is that the best way to regulate the gas industry is to throw every
corner of it open to competition, which, she believes, will keep prices
down far more than continually adding on regulation.
She was honest enough to point out she was not really answerable to
anyone at Parliament and that her annual report to Parliament went
virtually unread.
Ms Spottiswoode even rubbished the select committee system, pointing
out she had given evidence to two, and both had come up with
diametrically opposite conclusions. All of which will not endear her to
MPs, who prefer their civil servants to be a bit more, well, civil.
Her honesty has shown the Government was not aware of the powers it
was handing out when it created the regulators for the privatised
utilities. Under Labour, it may become a far more political job, and Ms
Spottiswoode may find her face no longer fits if a Labour Government is
elected.
As politicians will often tell you in private, honesty is not always
the best policy.

Telephone subscribers are beginning to enjoy the fruits of increased
competition, but what does the future hold? Anne Johnston reports
HOW much more good news can we take from the telephone companies? Last
month Mercury announced a single rate for national calls. From July
their subscribers will be able to dial all over the country for as
little as 2.5p a minute.
Yesterday British Telecom responded with a package of tariff cuts
which they reckon will save British phone users #310m this year and cut
the average bill by nearly 4%. It is only last September that BT cut the
cost of many long-distance calls by up to 25%.
Meanwhile, the mobile phone companies are virtually giving away their
equipment with packets of cereal.
Their call charges are much higher and the six networks now face an
inquiry from the Consumer Association because their charges are so
complex and confusing that it is difficult for customers to find the
best deals. Nevertheless, bills in this sector are tumbling too and
there are some very attractive packages on offer, such as free off-peak
local calls to personal callers from Mercury One-2-One.
On the face of it, all this is a triumph for competition. But is it?
And how much more good news should we expect from the phone companies,
given the new competition emerging from cable television and computer
networks, which is poised to cream off large chunks of their most
profitable operations.
To what extent can tumbling tariffs be put down to competition and
effective regulation and how much is it due to mind-bending
technological innovation witnessed by this sector since deregulation?
Howard Williams, professor in management studies at Strathclyde
University and a respected expert on developments in telecommunications
policy, says the jury is still out on this one, but certainly nobody
should underestimate the importance of the technological revolution.
''A few years ago BT was lumbered with a hybrid, some would say
clapped-out, network. Now they have become very efficient. Today they
have a very high quality network and can offer prices that are very
competitive,'' he says.
Williams believes enormous changes in both transmission and switching
of calls, the two basic procedures involved, have brought operational
costs crashing down. ''With the new digital systems the relative cost of
transmission has become so cheap that you can make calls almost anywhere
in the world for next to nothing once the capital investment is in
place.'' Repair costs have also been cut because of the way you can
rebuild the digital networks, re-routing calls to avoid a fault.
The elimination of smaller exchanges means that even someone phoning
from one street to another in a small town will have that call routed
via a switching centre which may be 100 miles away.
Of course, this ongoing revolution, has enormous manpower
implications. A typical example is what has happened in Hamilton and
Airdrie. Before the two telephone exchanges were digitalised, a total of
19 skilled engineers were required to keep them going. Now one engineer
maintains both exchanges.
Williams says these changes have enabled BT to cut their costs
dramatically and forced Mercury to cut their tariffs to remain
competitive.
What part has the Regulator played in all this? On the face of it, he
has been working on the consumer's behalf, insisting on cuts. Williams
says it can be argued that the Regulator has acted to keep prices up. In
other words, prices could have been cut even further than the present
agreement of the Retail Price Index minus 7.5%. This is because, having
created the competition, the Government doesn't want BT to squeeze its
fledgling competitors too hard.
''The change in the network has left Scotland at a disadvantage. We
have local and long distance call charges which bear little relation to
costs of the network. Yesterday BT could have introduced a single tariff
for all calls within Scotland,'' says Professor Williams.
Bill Furness, national manager for BT in Scotland, agrees that,
''things are moving in this direction and so are we''. For example,
local call areas are being enlarged (the whole of the Western Isles now
falls into the same local call area). A single tariff would be possible,
fixed somewhere between local and long-distance rates, which would be
tough on those who make only local calls.
What of the future? Williams believes the rapid development of
fibre-optic technology will mean that within 10 years there could be a
single tariff for the whole of Europe.
But at the same time new players are appearing on the horizon. They
may completely transform the way we communicate and the cost of getting
in touch. Cable television networks can bring you the telephone along
with entertainment at little extra cost and could become big players on
local networks.
But in the long term a more potent threat to the phone companies must
come from computer networks. It is already possible to buy a gadget to
transform voice calls into a computer signal and send it via the
Internet to the other side of the world, where it is reconverted into
speech. It costs #100. Once the user has paid an access charge, they can
talk to anyone anywhere in the world for nothing.
If cable TV grabs a big chunk of the local market and the Internet
muscles in on international calls the phone companies could be left
struggling. Then the good news for their remaining customers might start
running out.
* Local calls will be cut by 9% -- and by as much as 22% at weekends.
Longer distance calls, as well as international prices, will be cheaper.
* Switch to pricing-by-the-second, in line with BT's rivals.
* Daytime local calls made during a weekday will cost 12p for three
minutes compared with the present 15p. On Saturdays and Sundays the cost
of a five-minute local call will fall from 10p to 5p.
* Public pay phones will continue to charge at 10p a unit and
directory inquiry calls will remain at 25p.
* Residential customers will save an average of #8.40, bringing
average bills, including rental, down by 3.7% to #226 a year, while
businesses will see their charges cut by an average of #22.75, with
average bills falling by 3.9% to #509 a year.
* BT said it had reduced the average residential bill by 10% since
December 1993 and average business bills by 13%.
* BT has 21 million residential customers and six million business
customers making a total of 100 million calls a day.

I WAS amused to read that George Robertson, MP should choose to use a
statement from myself as somehow evidencing that Labour faced little or
no threat from the SNP (May 30).
The purpose of my statement was to try to divert more resources from
the SNP towards targeting Labour seats in order to help expose to the
Scottish electorate the folly of continuing to support a corrupt Labour
monolith in Scotland which at national level has completely failed to
protect Scotland's interests and at local level has brought the entire
system of local government into disrepute.
Despite Labour having 49 of Scotland's 72 MPs and overwhelming control
of Scottish local government, Labour have for decades presided over the
destruction of Scotland's industrial base.
Living as I do in Paisley and witnessing the Labour Party contributing
to the damage of the town's reputation, I recognise that urgent action
is required to improve life in this area and the Labour Party in
Scotland is the least likely of all Scotland's political parties to take
that action.
Far from taking any comfort from statements made by me, George
Robertson would be spending his time more productively if he was to
offer Paisley North's MP, Irene Adams, some support in trying to unlock
the activities of the Labour Party in Renfrewshire.
The people of Paisley and Scotland await George Robertson's
explanation on what the Labour Party in this area has been up to and
wonder why all these problems were not addressed when Keir Hardie House
were first supplied with the information.
No doubt George Robertson was too busy with the local elections to
bother. After all, why let a bit of Labour sleaze get in the way of
another electoral success for New Labour?

IT WAS a grotesquely inept sense of timing that induced the MoD to
bring yet another convoy of Trident warheads up to Scotland on Thursday,
May 11 -- the very day that saw the closing of the special UN conference
designed to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, when 178 nations
agreed to an indefinite extension of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).
While our representatives were signing this treaty committing Britain
to reducing our nuclear arsenal, we were busy increasing our stockpile
by another 10 warheads.
By the NPT, nations without nuclear weapons agree to renounce these in
perpetuity, while as a quid pro quo, under Article VI, the five declared
nuclear powers commit themselves to reduction and eventually elimination
of all their nuclear weapons.
Although both the US and Russia have made substantial cuts in their
nuclear stockpile, the UK continues to press ahead with Trident, which
in terms of technical efficiency -- range, accuracy, lethality -- is
undeniably a massive increase.
Indeed, this is freely acknowledged by the House of Commons Select
Commitee on Defence, which described Trident as ''a significant
enhancement of the UK's nuclear capability''. This description flatly
contradicts Malcolm Rifkind's oft-repeated claim that it is a ''minimum
deterrent''.
The Defence Committee's appraisal is vindicated by any honest
consideration of the facts. Every eight days one more Trident warhead
comes off the production line. While there were -- and are -- around 100
Polaris warheads, the total of operational Trident warheads is to be
300. These have a much longer range and can hit six times as many
targets. Each warhead has 100 kilotons of killing power, ie, it is eight
times more powerful than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima, where the final
death toll was 200,000 . . . And there are 96 warheads on each
submarine, ready to be launched at 15 minutes' notice.
The sheer enormity of indiscriminate slaughter on this scale surpasses
all human imagination. How can we comprehend eight Hiroshimas, when we
can never grasp the horror of one? Trident is the worst thing in the
world; worse even than Rwanda, Belsen or Hiroshima. It is the epiphany
of absolute malevolence.
However, what I wish to focus on here is not the moral or technical
aspects of Trident but the broader question of its impact on this
country's political and economic life. In Scotland, at Coulport, we have
the largest arsenal of nuclear bombs in Europe. We also have what is
probably the largest store of conventional explosives -- 27,000 tons of
it -- in the NATO arms dump in Glen Douglas. Because material has been
transferred here from Germany since the collapse of the USSR and
reunification, there is now more here than at the height of the cold
war.
When all the old free-fall (WE-177) bombs are withdrawn from service
in 1998, Britain's entire nuclear arsenal will be stored here in
Scotland. And when the Trident submarines are past their ''use by''
date, you can guess where the radioactive hulks will be dumped.
It is Scotland also that has to suffer the noise and environmental
damage caused by low-flying aircraft. With the exception of a very small
area in the north of England and in Wales, all UK ultra-low flying zones
are in the Borders and the North-west Highlands. Whatever role low
flying played in the last war, the advance in hi-tech anti-aircraft
weaponry makes it an unusable tactic in modern warfare. Experience in
the Gulf War and the Falklands show this clearly.
What we see in all these instances is the increasing militarisation of
our land and economy and a growing polarisation of political reactions
in Scotland. Scotland is looking more and more like the absurd last
bastion of Empire. While Britain seems incapable of finding her role in
Europe, and clings to Trident as a totem of former imperial status, we
are the ones who have to suffer the consequences.
All this is increasingly seen as morally intolerable, and a distortion
of normal political and economic life in Scotland. All sections of
Scottish society have expressed their repugnance at the imposition of
Trident. Opinion polls show that 75% of the population of Scotland do
not want Trident. Leading figures in academic and cultural life are
virtually unanimous in their condemnation. The Christian churches have
rejected it, as have representatives of other religions. In its
deliverance of May 20, 1982, the General Assembly of the Church of
Scotland ''renounced the use of nuclear power for war-like purposes''.
In an Easter statement of the same year, the Catholic bishops of
Scotland were equally forthright; ''if it is immoral to use these
weapons, it is immoral to threaten their use''.
The two largest political parties reflect this national mood. The
Scottish Labour Party rejects Trident. Unfortunately, it has the problem
of being tied to the policies of the British party, and its promised
parliament would still leave us with Trident. The SNP is committed to
scrapping Trident.
I believe there can be no more potent a symbol of the lack of genuine
democracy in Scotland than this obscene monster wallowing in the
polluted waters of the Gareloch, with the wasted landscape of Coulport
and Faslane a tragic backdrop.
On May 12, when President Clinton was in Kiev, he praised the Ukraine
for giving up nuclear weapons. ''Your nation can claim responsibility
for a major contribution to world peace . . . your wise decision to
eliminate nuclear weapons on your territory has earned your nation
respect and gratitude everywhere in the world.'' Why should this same
logic not apply here? What is sauce for the Ukrainian goose is sauce for
the Scottish gander. The excuses the UK Goverment makes -- we live in a
dangerous and unstable world, fears of a revived Russia etc -- could
equally be made by the Ukraine with even more credibility. They, after
all, share a common frontier with Russia.
Britain evidently sees herself as excluded from the moral restraints
demanded of all other states. The assumption is that we can be trusted
to have H-bombs, but they cannot. This is our thermonuclear White Man's
Burden, an atomic birthright bestowed on ''Great'' Britain but forever
forbidden to lesser breeds. At the heart of British nuclear delusions
there lies an unacknowledged and unarticulated racism, the most
repellent legacy of our imperial past.

THE peasants' revolt may have been crushed but it proved a Pyrrhic
victory yesterday for Mr Cedric Brown and Mr Richard Giordano of British
Gas.
The big battalions made up of the City institutions may have come
riding to their rescue, like the Seventh Cavalry, when the votes were
cast at the ninth British Gas annual general meeting, but it was the
small shareholders who won the argument. They may well have changed
things for ever.
There has never been an AGM like it. Around 7000 small shareholders
crammed the dusty black wastes of the London Arena in Docklands, that
monument to Thatcherism, perching on uncomfortable plastic chairs for
hours on end to voice their rage at the way their board had behaved,
particularly over Mr Brown's salary increase and the executives' own
pay. However, it was also the way British Gas had ceased to be a public
utility and turned itself into an international concern that worried
them, one which they could not influence.
The big City battalions -- everyone knows who they are but Mr Giordano
refused to name them -- may have backed the smooth big gas boss, who
chaired the five-and-a-quarter hour meeting with all the finesse of a
natural-born Godfather, but, on reflection, they will be unable to
ignore the way he, and his chief executive, Mr Brown, had inflamed the
small shareholders.
When it was all over, SNP leader Alex Salmond, said it had been an
enormous moral victory for the small shareholders and a massive snub for
the leadership of British Gas. ''My message to Giordano and Brown is
change course,'' he added. ''As we say in Scotland, their jaickits are
on a shooglie nail.''
At last year's AGM, 617 shareholders turned out, which gives some
measure how the events of past months of have upset them. It was
perfectly obvious yesterday that, for many, it was the first time they
had attended a company AGM.
There were 13 motions before the meeting and Mr Giordano, getting only
slightly rattier as the weary day wore on, ploughed through them in
order, allowing people to speak to each in turn and letting some of the
troublemakers speak too often.
It was a clever ploy, because it weakened the power of their
arguments. The crucial two motions came last and, by then, some of the
heat had gone out of the debate, while some of the shareholders had
wearied of waiting for a foregone conclusion and gone home.
Everyone knew the City institutions had heeded the pleas of Giordano
and Brown to save them. They may have turned the British Gas small
shareholders into a rebel army but the alternative, the mass resignation
of the board, was worse for a company not in the best of health.
The key motion, number 13, sponsored by Pension and Investment
Research Consultants, calling on the company to change its pay policy
for executives, was rejected by 82% of the shareholders once the proxy
votes of the instutitions were called in.
However, like motion 12, moved by Professor Joe Lamb of Cupar, Fife,
which called for an advisory group, including shareholders, to be set up
to deal with issues relating to the interests of consumers,
shareholders, and employees, it was overwhelmingly carried on the floor
of the meeting. No such blatantly cynical exercise of naked block-vote
power has been seen since the bad old days of trade union control of the
Labour Party conference.
When it came to the resolution appointing Mr Brown, the proxy
endorsement was overwhelming but the number backing him in the hall
could have been counted on the fingers of three or four hands.
The day began with the arrival of a 30st British saddleback pig called
Cedric, brought by the GMB union from a nearby docklands farm. Cedric
posed for photographers, uttered some grunts, and seemed deeply
unimpressed by the occasion. Eventually, he charged the photographers.
As the shareholders filed in, demonstrators led by Mr Chris Gorman
from Livingston, shouted -- ''We get the boot, they get the loot'' and
''Jobs, not dole''. Mr Gorman said he had come down by bus with about
another 60 Scots and that most of them were still employed.
Inside the vast sports hall, an arena had been devised with, at one
end, a huge blue rostrum on which the board were to sit, enduring for
the most part in silence the insults of the hoi polloi. The crush was
immense. Mr Giordano opened the proceedings with a smoothly-delivered
speech -- he was using the transparent idiot boards, adopted by Lady
Thatcher, which are designed to impress an audience with the sincerity
and fluency of the speaker.
He told them of the painful restructuring process the board had
embarked on before launching into a justification of the executive pay
rises. Yes, Cedric Brown had a very large rise, and yes, in total, it
was a very large sum.
Changes were necessary. The chief executive's job was one of the most
complex in the UK and they knew from the advice of consultants that, if
they wished to recruit a new chief executive, they would have to pay him
more than they were paying Cedric Brown.
''Many of you have complained that his pay is excessive and have made
comparisons with the pay of other professions essential to the
community, such as teachers, nurses, and doctors,'' he said. ''It is
true that there are significant differentials in income in society. It
may also be true that this causes a degree of social stress.
''But we operate with a mandate from our shareholders to improve our
performance. We must be able to retrain and recruit the best people and
we must stay broadly within the custom and practice of the industry as a
whole. If we deviate too far, we do so at our peril.''
The commander of the Titanic probably said the same. Certainly by now
he had lost his audience who had listened in silence to all that had
gone before. They did not agree when he blamed the media for
bad-mouthing the board in the pay row, which is usually what happens
when politicians resort to this age-old trick to secure some cheap
support.
Media coverage had obscured their message to shareholders and
customers which could have put the record straight on issues like pay,
service, and safety. The shareholders thought otherwise. ''We must put
all of this behind us and get on with the task of managing British
Gas,'' he said.
No such luck. The discussion on the resolutions to re-appoint the
various directors up for re-election started off quietly enough but it
was more a case of people unaccustomed to such affairs feeling their way
than any lack of passion. That soon became apparent as the complaints,
the cries of pain, and the insults started to flow in the direction of
the board. They sat behind their blue desk like so many coconuts on a
fairground sideshow.
The voices from the floor were unanimous. Mr Andrew Gibson, a tax
inspector from Cathcart, told them they had failed to curb boardroom
greed and demanded that they resign immediately, leaving Mr Giordano to
shovel the company out of its mess. He said Mr Brown had deceived the
Commons Select Committee when he gave evidence and accused Mr Giordano
of treating the meeting like an Italian dictator. ''I am less than
convinced by what you have told us today,'' he said.
Labour MP Ken Livingstone, representing the New York City Pension
Fund, demanded that television cameras be allowed in and said the
meeting was ''the most interesting thing to come to Docklands since the
Kray gang''.
There were attempts to adjourn the meeting, to force procedural votes
which were ruled out of order, Mr Brown, who was silent for the first
quarter at last joined in the fray and made clear he was no quitter. He
had not misled the Select Committee. They had failed to ask the right
questions.
As each vote for the re-election of a board member was taken and
defeated by the floor, Mr Giordano reminded them of the realities of
force majeur. When the proxies came to be counted at the end of the day,
they would have raised their hands and waved their red voting cards to
no avail. It did nothing to sweeten the mood.
Professor Lamb proved most dignified. Moving his motion, he said he
had become the conduit for the feelings of many people in Britain that
company bosses had become greedy and self-serving. He was surprised at
he fuss the board had made about his motion.
If it had been sensible, it would have said it was glad of the
shareholders' input, it would help it run the company better, so let us
have a discussion. But it had gone round the City threatening people.
''Perhaps the board have forgotten that we are their employers,'' he
said. ''They should listen to us, not act like spoiled children not
getting their own way. It is clear to everyone, except the City
institutions, that the board have made a shambles of handling this issue
and my motion is aimed at this shambles. How could you have got things
so wrong?''
He ended with the most chilling words of the day for the board. ''We
will not go away,'' he said. ''We will lose this year but we will be
back next year and the next year.''

LORD Owen, who yesterday confirmed he was to resign as EU peace
mediator for the former Yugoslavia by the end of June, warned that if
there was no settlement by the autumn, UN forces might have to withdraw.
The former SDP leader, now a crossbencher, insisted in the Lords that
UN troops should remain in Bosnia-Herzegovina to fulfil their
humanitarian mandate.
However, he warned: ''I do not believe this humanitarian intervention
can be extended through a fourth winter and, if there is not a peace
settlement by the autumn of this year, then the UN forces, I fear, will
be forced to leave.''
Lord Owen, EU co-chairman of the international conference on the
former Yugoslavia, told peers in an emergency debate on the Bosnian
crisis: ''Hopefully we will hear a little less from the lap-top
bombardiers and a little more of the voice of compromise and reason.''
He declared his support for the Government's latest moves in the
deteriorating situation, and told the House: ''I wish I could have been
able to give you more concrete evidence of the endeavours we have
undertaken in trying to achieve peace.''
In his maiden Lords speech, he said: ''In view of the grave situation
developing with tragic predictability in Bosnia-Herzegovina, I felt it
was right that I should speak in this Parliamentary debate.''
He stressed the central question was: ''Are British forces being
sucked ever more into a Balkan war as a combatant, on the back of a UN
humanitarian intervention?
''Sadly, my answer is that we are, and we need to be very clear about
what is involved if we are to go down this route.''
''Slowly and inextricably on the ground, those who wear the UN blue
helmets are being dragged into the conflict between the parties.
''We should not be surprised by this trend, given the massive
pressures for this to happen. We need to decide for ourselves whether we
will allow this to happen.''
Lord Owen cited the example of Somalia in 1993, where he said a UN
humanitarian mission had been drawn into the local conflict.
Reacting to the Bosnian Serb tactics, he warned: ''They have made,
even by their own standards, a grave miscalculation in taking those
large numbers of UN hostages.
''Certainly they misunderstand the British people if they believe that
we would ever withdraw our UN forces, not just while our men in blue
helmets are, but any UN peace keeper is, held hostage.''
He condemned the hostage-taking as a ''despicable and disreputable
practice, which does nothing but sully the reputation of those army
officers who lay claim to follow in the proud traditions of former
Serbian armies''.
He declared: ''There is only one way forward. For the UN to be given
every possible assistance to sustain its presence on the basis of the
impartial application of its humanitarian mission.''
''That's why the Government is right to nearly triple the British
presence in the former Yugoslavia.''
Leader of the House, Lord Cranborne, also urged support for the
Government's decision to send more troops to Bosnia and called on peers
to give a ''message of support'' to British soldiers -- especially those
held hostage.
Opening the emergency debate, he said it was possible the present
escalation would be seen in retrospect as a ''dangerous phase'' and UN
Protection Force (Unprofor) would not need the additional firepower, and
the UN would be able to exercise the task given to it in less tense
conditions.
However, he warned that it was also possible that Bosnia was ''on the
brink of something infinitely nastier and more dangerous''.
Labour peers' leader Lord Richard echoed Lord Cranborne's praise for
the British and UN forces, saying they were doing an ''extraordinarily
good job in an extraordinarly difficult situation''.
A former UK representative to the UN, he said he supported the
Government's view that the UN's intervention had helped in Bosnia.
Opposing a UN withdrawal or a unilateral pull-out of British forces,
Lord Richard stressed such actions would lead to ''more, not less
bloodshed''.
But he voiced concern that the role of the substantial reinforcements
announced by the Government should be clearly defined.
He warned that lack of clarity would produce indecision, indecision
would produce drift, and that would ''produce disaster''.
Another note of caution was sounded by Former Labour Prime Minister,
Lord Callaghan, who warned the Government to beware of the risks of
escalation of the conflict in Bosnia.
He said he did not criticise the actions taken by Ministers ''so
far'', but insisted they must be clear about their objectives once they
sent in fighting troops.
Lord Callaghan disputed Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd's claim that
the Government was continuing on its ''present course''.
That course so far had been to deliver humanitarian aid and use
minimum force in self-defence, the Labour peer said.
He said: ''The despatch of troops with fighting capacity and
capability makes a fresh departure and a deeper involvement.''
Lord Callaghan stressed: ''Unless the Government and the House faces
this, we shall continue, and find ourselves on a slippery slope.''
He added he would not contemplate armed intervention in Bosnia
''unless I had the Americans with us''.

Murray Ritchie, European Editor, reports how the renegotiation of
Maastricht could be the making or breaking of the European Union, with
Britain determined to block any moves for greater integration,
rekindling the debate on our membership
TALKS on the dominant political issue facing Europe begin formally
tomorrow, marking the 40th anniversary of the meeting which led to the
founding of the European Union.
From then on we will have to learn to live with developments in the
unfolding saga which will be the renegotiation of the Maastricht treaty
in the lead-up to next year's EU super-summit, whose conclusion could
coincide with a British General Election.
The scope for political upheaval in this inter-governmental conference
(IGC) is vast -- probably enough to force a new debate on the whole
question of Britain's continued membership of the European Union.
In a year of momentous anniversaries, mostly to do with war, the EU is
about to commemorate 40 years of the event which is credited with
securing the peace by creating a trading community with a reconciled
France and Germany at its core. In Messina, Sicily, the leaders of
today's 15 EU member-states will begin work on the agenda for the IGC
intended to refine Maastricht so that it works more efficiently.
The first Maastricht negotiation took a year. Altering it could take
two, perhaps more. As Ministers return to the Sicilian sun they can
reflect on the fact that in the same place four decades earlier -- to
the day -- their predecessors signed the treaties which established the
Treaty of Rome and what we used to call the Common Market.
Then only six nations were involved in the negotiations which led to
the signing of the Treaty of Rome, and, as usual, there were expressions
of regret that the British did not feel the need to attend.
As the Maastricht revision approaches, most of the tensions it
provokes are felt in the United Kingdom, where a divided Conservative
Government is sworn to resist closer integration, which it sees as an
unacceptable surrender of national sovereignty.
The most Euro-sceptic Minister in attendance will be our own Mr David
Davis, who will arrive determined to thwart the much talked of ''great
leap forward'' in the integration process. It says something of the
Tories' cooling on the EU that Mr Major should appoint a Euro-sceptic as
his Minister for Europe. Most observers believe Mr Davis will be hard
pushed to find allies.
For this reason some believe agreement can only be reached after a
British General Election -- and that would mean postponing formal
agreement beyond the spring of 1997 on the assumption that John Major's
administration will be removed from office, making way for a more
Euro-friendly Labour government.
Mr Tony Blair, increasingly sounding like Mr Major's echo these days,
told Chancellor Kohl of Germany earlier this week he would not be a
pushover on the integration question. But most onlookers believe Labour
would indeed be more accommodating to Britain's EU partners once an
election was out of the way.
IGCs are becoming inseparable from European politics. This will be
only the sixth in over 40 years of the European Union's history, but the
fourth in 11 years. All of the previous five have been milestones on the
road to a more integrated Europe, producing variously the Single
European Act, Maastricht with its plans for a single currency, and
closer co-operation in many critical areas such as immigration and the
fight against organised crime.
If the process continues, the so-called Maastricht II will be a less
complicated version of the original with more majority-voting to oil the
wheels of decision-making in an ever-expanding community. It is this one
crucial area which is the cause of deepest concern to some states,
notably Britain.
The last act of the 1991 IGC which produced Maastricht was a call for
another meeting five years on to review progress. Most observers see
clearly now that Maastricht was mainly about planning a single currency
with secondary areas for future co-operation thrown in.
These are not difficult to surmise. Decision-making in foreign affairs
is high on the list. The EU's biggest challenge in the next decade or so
is eastwards enlargement. A long line of ex-communist states -- all in
need of substantial economic assistance -- are queueing impatiently for
EU membership.
This leads to the second challenge. Apart from finding how to
subsidise this vast transition, an enlarged EU must also find a more
efficient system for making decisions. The old days of empty chairs and
vetoes, when one state could hold the others to ransom for selfish
reasons, must go if the EU is to function properly. Yet national
sovereignty must be observed.
To some extent the agenda is already known: at the last Maastricht
conference it was decided that the 1996 meeting would examine
subsidiarity (moving decision-making from Brussels closer to the
people), social affairs and its relationship to the single market,
foreign policy, defence and home affairs, and the share-out of power
among the Council of Ministers, Commission and European Parliament.
Belatedly, Ministers have added to the agenda other touchy subjects
including a review of the number of commissioners, voting procedures in
the council, and ideas on making the institutions work better. There
will also be demands from the European Parliament for more powers.
The second pillar, for example, offers the prospect of a common
foreign and defence policy. But, because this involves purely
inter-governmental co-operation, progress has been limited to say the
least. Much the same applies in home affairs and justice. Breaking this
logjam through agreement is a huge test for the IGC, and one which is
fraught with difficulties as nation states like the UK perceive their
independence being eroded.
At the heart of the voting debate will be the role of the Big Four
(Germany, Britain, France and Italy). Traditionally, they have largely
dictated the direction of the EU but the latest enlargement round which
admitted Austria, Finland and Sweden, ensured that the smaller members
are now an increasingly powerful -- perhaps too powerful -- voting bloc.
This is the threatened Tyranny of the Tiny, so feared by the Big Four
that a change in the weighted voting process is high on the agenda.
No-one can be certain that the reshaped European Union which emerges
from this process will be more democratic. Like the commission, the
European Parliament -- the EU's only directly elected institution --
will enjoy some influence on the outcome but no direct say. It is
arguing for more power, especially a greater say in shared
decision-making with the council.
One of parliament's vice-presidents and leading constitutionalists, Mr
David Martin, a British socialist, remarked recently: ''The EU is so
undemocratic that if it applied for membership of itself it would
probably be rejected.'' Just how much this widely-shared frustration
will play with possessive presidents and prime ministers is an open
question.

As events in Bosnia reached crisis point, the House of Commons covened
fro an emergency session. Stephen McGregor Parliamentary Correspondent,
reports on a historic occasion.
BOSNIA is at a turning point, the Prime Minister said yesterday as he
repeated his warning to the leaders of the Bosnian Serbs that they would
be held personally responsible for the well being and safe return of the
British troops held hostage.
In the tense emergency Commons debate on the Bosnian issue, which saw
Parliament recalled during a recess for only the 13th time since the
Second World War, Mr Major sought to justify the decision to send extra
troops to the area, with others on standby.
He also said that withdrawal was not an option -- though he admitted
the ability to handle it would be helped by the further deployment --
and warned of serious consequences if all-out war broke out in the
region.
Mr Major, who won broad support for the present strategy from Labour
leader Tony Blair, told the House: ''The way ahead may be rocky and
painful. Many people will advocate withdrawing the United Nations
Protection Force (Unprofor) and circumstances could arise in which that
could become inevitable. But withdrawal is not a policy. No-one should
believe that leaving Bosnia would end the United Kingdom's interest in
this conflict.''
The Prime Minister posed a series of questions on what would be the
possible consequences of withdrawal. He argued that the first likely
outcome would be that Muslim areas would come under immediate threat,
with ''massive'' bloodshed and loss of life.
He doubted if the West could stand idly by and let this happen, and
nor did he believe it would ignore the threat of an all-out Balkan war.
Facing pressure from a number of his own MPs for withdrawal of British
forces, Mr Major told the House: ''Leaving Bosnia, if Unprofor is forced
to do so, is not an easy or a pain-free option.
''These threats would return if Unprofor withdrew, and we and our
allies would have to find other ways of responding to them -- ways which
could conceivably impose a greater military and financial burden on us
than we are now carrying.
''Those who contemplate withdrawal must think very carefully about the
humanitarian consequences and the strategic implications for European
security. At present Unprofor is holding the ring -- it must try to
continue to do so while we seek a political solution.''
Unprofor and the British forces had not extinguished the fighting in
Bosnia, but they had contained it and they had prevented it from
spreading.
Mr Major reminded the House why British troops originally had been
sent to the area, and of the work they had done since. He said: ''Not
only were soldiers being killed, we were also seeing civilian suffering
in Bosnia on a massive scale.''
There was ethnic cleansing, cold-blooded racial-based murders,
widespread rape and brutality.
''The servicemen and women of 19 nations have stood with our relief
agencies and our troops to help alleviate the suffering. Many who would
have died are alive today because of that effort, and many alive today
would die if that effort ended.''
The Prime Minister told MPs that no-one should doubt Britain's resolve
to secure the safe return of the soldiers held hostage. He said: ''With
the lives of British soldiers at stake there will be a need for
patience, a need for restraint, perhaps at times a need for silence.''
''But if those silences are long, and the requirement for restraint
and patience becomes great, do not imagine they are forgotten. The work
to secure their release will be unremitting.
''Our troops have not gone to Bosnia to make war, but even on
humanitarian duties we have seen they need protection. If they are
attacked they must be able to defend themselves robustly.''
For Labour, Mr Blair, in an impressive contribution, said his party
had offered Mr Major its support in his latest actions, adding: ''I
believe the more united we can be in this House on this issue the
better.'' MPs would particularly want to send a message of ''the deepest
support'' to those soldiers taken hostage.
''Our thoughts and prayers are with them, their safety is our
uppermost priority. The taking of them as hostages was a barbarous act
of terrorism.''
Mr Blair said Labour backed the sending of reinforcements, but
stressed they must have a clear chain of command and clear rules of
engagement. He said: ''I believe the talk of withdrawal in Bosnia in
response to the taking of hostages is deeply unhelpful at this time.
''It is hardly a message of firm resolve in what is effectively an act
of coercive blackmail. The Bosnian Serbs must understand that they
cannot fulfil their aim of an ethnically pure Serbian state by these
means. Until they accept the route of diplomacy they will remain
outcasts on the international stage.
''We should not engage in any truck with them whatever in which the
release of hostages is in return for a pledge never to use our air
power.''
On wider political considerations, Mr Blair said that if the UN was to
stay, firm and clear steps must be taken radically to improve its
position, and thus of the British forces.
The UN mandate must be enforced clearly and consistently and be backed
up with the necessary men and weapons. There was a very strong case for
demilitarising the safe areas, and the further tightening of sanctions
should be considered.
Above all, however, the UN presence could only act as a platform for a
diplomatic peace effort.
He added: ''The decisions we take now are of momentous import for the
world, its order and stability. Let us make sure these decisions are the
right ones, for we shall live with their consequences.''
Liberal Democrat Leader Paddy Ashdown declared: ''Our first duty is
quite clear at the moment. It is to those who are now in Serb hands. And
nothing we say in this debate should damage their chances of return.
''And nothing we decide to do in the longer term can be put into
practice until they have returned.''
Mr Ashdown said it was now most likely that the best route to freeing
the hostages was a diplomatic solution, backed by the whole Commons.
''The Government is entitled to our support in this situation and they
will get it.'' He fully supported the decision to send more troops.
Withdrawal ''should be the last option because it's the worst
option'', he continued.
Mr Ashown, who has consistently called for tougher action in former
Yugoslavia, accused the UN of ''muddling through'' the crisis.
Former Tory Prime Minister Sir Edward Heath urged caution and said the
''crux of the whole matter'' was whether Britain was prepared to go to
war.
''Are you prepared to go to war?'' he challenged MPs, adding: ''The
answer is no.''
Extra efforts should be made to effect a peaceful settlement. The UN
would survive a withdrawal if it came to it.
Tony Benn warned he would try to force a technical vote at the end of
the debate to oppose the Government's actions.
He said the Prime Minister, in sending British troops, had used the
''Royal Prerogative of war-making'' while MPs had no say.
''I intend to vote against what the Government has done because I
think the policy of the Government endangered the hostages and because
the uncertainty of our objectives now could put them into greater
danger.
He added:''I don't think we should give the Goverment a blank cheque
to do what it likes with our soldiers in a situation of quite
exceptional danger.''
Mr Benn said there had been no clarification of the objectives behind
sending more troops and insisted that in a civil war only humanitarian
aid, mediation and an arms embargo could help.
Former Tory minister David Howell, chairman of the Foreign Affairs
Select Committee, said the Government had been right to act
''forcefully'' by sending more troops. This had focused the nation's
determination to ''get back our hostages unharmed''.
Mr Howell said: ''I would be in favour, I think, of a huge military
operation if the will existed for one moment to mount such a thing which
could isolate and crush the Bosnian Serbs''.
Intervening, Tory Michael Lord (Suffolk C) warned: ''Doesn't history
show us that with these kind of aggressors, if we don't stop them
sooner, we have to stop them later.''
Labour's John Home Robertson (East Lothian), a member of the Defence
Select Committee said he had been a truck driver in an aid convoy Bosnia
last year for Edinburgh Direct Aid for four weeks.
The Bosnian Serb army were the worst offenders in the conflict. Now
they were responsible for peacemakers being held as prisoners of war.
''These people are despicable,'' he said.
''We cannot allow a savage, racist expansionist force to go on doing
its worst on the very doorstep of the European Community.
''Let's stop talking about withdrawal which means capitulation to
sheer tyranny.''
To cheers he added: ''We have got to see this thing through!''
Tory former Defence Secretary Tom King (Bridgwater) told MPs: ''The
lesson we learned from the Gulf War is that there are many audiences now
for our debates on television, and they aren't just in this country.''
''I have no doubt at all that reports will quickly pass to Pale (the
Bosnian Serb ''capital'') as well as to whether the UK stands staunchly
behind the Government in the actions it has taken.''
Mr Tam Dalyell (Linlithgow -- Lab) argued there should be an end to
the bombing which, he argued, had been initiated by the Americans.
He told the House: ''I say to the Prime Minister and the Leader of the
Opposition that for all the rhetoric and haranguing it won't make any
difference to those on the spot threatened with missile attacks. Why do
we not simply say there will be no more attacks of this kind, which were
entirely American-initiated?''
Mr Dalyell went on: ''Can you continue the threat of aerial attack and
at the same time have troops carrying out what is supposed to be a
humanitarian mission? I don't think you can have both.''
Mr Dalyell warned of the threat from experienced guerilla fighters in
the Serb ranks and expressed concern about the cover being provided for
the new wave of British forces being sent in.
At the end of the debate, Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind told MPs
that the British forces needed to know they had the unqualified
endorsement of the House, and that this was necessary for their morale.
Labour left-wingers had hoped to force a technical protest vote, but
their efforts failed.

SCOTTISH Labour and SNP Euro-MPs united yesterday to resist a European
Commission proposal which, if implemented, would mean fishermen having
to pay for new hygiene inspections on their boats.
Labour's Hugh McMahon (Strathclyde West) said the bill for the British
industry would be #4m and he demanded that the Commission justified its
proposal. The SNP's Dr Allan Macartney (North East Scotland) called the
idea alarming and demanded a full debate in the European Parliament
later this month. He was backed by the Parliament's fisheries committee.
Mr Franz Fischler, Commissioner for agriculture, proposing a new
fishery products directive, wants fish catches to be subjected to
hygiene checks which, Labour Euro-MPs argued, are already carried out
free in the United Kingdom.
Mr Peter Crampton, Labour's Euro-spokesman on fish, said: ''Just
because Germany charges its fishing industry for hygiene inspections
there is no reason to slap the same charge on everyone else.
''The Commission's proposal will cost jobs, cut the prices paid to
fishermen, and increase the price of fish in the supermarket. It will do
nothing to improve food hygiene.''
He accused the Commission of using back-door methods to impose the
charges through a draft directive. ''The Commission has not even
consulted the European Parliament about this extra charge,'' he said.
''It has acted in an underhand and secretive way.''
Dr Macartney demanded that the Commission explain itself and accused
it of trying to circumvent parliamentary scrutiny by slipping the plan
through as an annexe to another directive.
He said the cost to the industry in Scotland would be crippling,
adding: ''There is indecent haste in proposing to have this matter
decided by the fisheries council next month. For this reason, the
fisheries committee must debate the matter in all its implications
before any decision is taken.''
* Mr McMahon later said he had organised a meeting in Brussels to
discuss the problems caused by increasing Norwegian salmon sales in the
EU. Norway has, in the past, been accused of dumping salmon and damaging
the businesses of Scottish and Irish fish farmers.
The meeting will be held between Scots, Irish, and Norwegian fish
farmers on June 20. Mr McMahon said: ''We must have control over the
supply of salmon from Norway into our markets or else we will see
serious disruption of the Scottish market in the short term. The
Commission has agreed to listen to our fishermen.''

Brussels
EUROPE could have a ''strong and stable'' single currency within the
next five years if conditions were right, it was claimed yesterday.
The European Commission launched its blueprint for a single currency
yesterday but admitted that winning over public opinion was just as
important as the technical difficulties involved.
It also took a swipe at countries including Britain which have doubts
about the wisdom of abandoning national currencies.
''For some, the transition to the single currency means the loss of
national monetary sovereignty,'' the Commission stated in a Green Paper.
''But how much autonomy do monetary policies really have today in
Europe?
''With capital moving freely between interdependent economies, an
autonomous monetary policy is no longer a credible policy option. Member
states will only lose a prerogative which in practice they cannot use.''
The paper stated: ''By the end of the century, the European Union will
have a strong and stable single currency. This is the wish of its
peoples and its leaders in signing and then ratifying the (Maastricht)
treaty on European Union.''
However, this confident forecast ignored growing predictions that the
Maastricht timetable for economic and monetary union (Emu) is
unrealistic. Despite speculation, however, there was no admission in the
paper that a start in 1997 was probably impossible.
The paper said that a meeting at the end of next year would decide if
a majority of member states met the conditions for embarking on monetary
union.
''If the decision is affirmative and if it deems it appropriate the
council will set the date for the beginning of the third stage,'' it
said. ''The third stage will in any case start no later than January 1,
1999.
''The transition to a single currency will be automatic on that date
for those countries which meet the criteria, however many of them there
are.''
Mr Yves-Thibault de Silguy, economics Commissioner, told reporters
that this year only Luxembourg, Ireland, and Germany met the debt and
deficit targets contained in the so-called convergence criteria which
dictate if countries can qualify. He urged greater efforts from other
member states.
At Maastricht, Prime Minister John Major negotiated a right for
Britain to remain outside a single currency if Parliament so decided. By
the time that the rest of the EU is ready to proceed with Emu, there
could be a Labour Government although party leader Tony Blair has said a
British decision to take part should involve the consent of the people
through a referendum or a General Election.
The paper listed the advantages of a single currency as making for a
more efficient European single market, stimulating growth and jobs,
cutting out costs estimated at #20,000m a year in foreign exchange
transactions, increasing international stability, and enhancing joint
monetary sovereignty among member states which would share one of the
world's most powerful currencies.
As Mr Jacques Santer, Commission President, presented the paper, the
European Parliament's big socialist group called for debate between
national and Euro-MPs on the issue.
Significantly for Labour, one of its leading Euro-MPs, Mr Alan
Donnelly, welcomed the paper as a ''fresh impetus to moves towards
Emu''.
Despite Mr Blair's cautious approach, Mr Donnelly, economic and
monetary affairs spokesman of the 221-strong socialist group, remarked:
''The European Council meeting in Cannes must respond positively to the
Green Paper. Political uncertainties surrounding the introduction of the
single currency must be resolved to allow the Commission to tackle the
important, practical issues set out in the Green Paper.''
Mr Donnelly echoed Commission moves to make sure the EU did not get
ahead of public opinion on the issue as it did in the run-up to the
Maastricht Treaty when, he argued, public opinion was simply ignored.
Mr de Silguy said: ''Credibility is very important. We have to
convince everybody that there is no going back. Launching the single
currency is like launching a rocket. By presenting this Green Paper, the
Commission hopes it will motivate Europe.''
He added: ''Winning public support is as, if not more, important as
handling the technical difficulties.''
The Commission warned that during the year between the decision to
proceed with Emu and the freezing of currency exchange rates there could
be heavy speculation on money markets.
It was waves of speculation which almost destroyed the European
exchange rate mechanism after the withdrawal of the British pound on
Black Wednesday in September, 1992, which provoked a Government crisis.

A WOMAN has failed in her bid to reopen the dairy blamed for a fatal
food poisoning outbreak.
West Lothian District Council yesterday rejected an application for a
pasteurisation licence from Miss Alix Haston, 19.
Miss Haston's parents, Robert and Margaret, were fined #1000 each at
Linlithgow Sheriff Court, earlier this year, for distributing milk which
was unfit for human consumption.
They have appealed against the conviction.
Miss Haston, a university student, wanted to set up her own business
in the Redhouse dairy in Blackburn, West Lothian.
It has been closed since the outbreak of food poisoning which killed
one child and struck down 60 other people in West Lothian in May last
year.
Council spokesman Mr Peter Johnston said: ''Her experience was very
limited.''

THE managing director of Italian firm Candy -- which has bought the
Hoover company's European operations -- said yesterday there is no
reason to fear job losses at the Cambuslang factory.
Mr Arrigo Arrigoni said the Lanarkshire plant, which makes vacuum
cleaners, was the key to the company's expansion plans.
He said: ''Candy is not manufacturing any kind of products in the
floorcare business at the moment. The reason for this acquisition is for
us to expand our business to this area.
''We believe we have got one of the best, if not the best, factory and
organisation to manufacture, market, and develop floorcare products.
''The Cambuslang factory will be retained as an advanced manufacturing
site with a very important role.''
He said the expertise of Hoover staff would be vital in developing
Candy's diversification into the production of floorcare goods.
He added that job losses were unlikely and dismissed fears that Candy
was interested only in manufacturing household appliances such as
washing machines, refrigerators, and cookers.
Mr Arrigoni said the takeover was still in its early stages and
details about future development were sketchy but said there was no
reason to rule out expansion of operations at Cambuslang.
He added that Hoover may be able to increase production by tapping
into Candy markets in eastern and southern Europe.
He said: ''We always want to expand and if we are successful at doing
that in Europe then why not expand at Cambuslang?''
Mr Arrigoni said he had met management at Cambuslang two weeks ago,
when Candy representatives also visited the plant. He said: ''Our first
impressions were very good.''
The managing director's comments were echoed by the Candy president,
Mr Peppino Fumagalli, who said: ''We understand the concerns that
employees will inevitably have at the news of a takeover but I would
like to set their minds at rest by stating that Candy has positive plans
for the development of the Hoover brand in Europe and beyond.''
He also pointed to the company's track record in the United Kingdom.
He said the number of jobs at a refrigeration plant in Merseyside had
increased four-fold since the 1980s.
The American company Maytag denied that Tuesday's #106m deal had been
forced on it by the failure of a free flights promotion.
However, experts regard the selling price as relatively low and insist
that the controversial scheme must have played a part in Maytag's
decision to rid itself of Hoover Europe.
Meanwhile, the works convener at the Cambuslang site, Mr Peter
Brannan, said he had called for a meeting with Candy managers.
He added: ''The information we have so far appears to be positive.
There is no reason they would want to get rid of a profitable
business.''
The controller of the Hoover Holiday Pressure Group, Mr Harry Cichy,
also called for talks with Candy management. It is understood the
Italian company will not accept any responsibility or liability for the
free-flights offer.
However, Mr Cichy said: ''We still want to talk to them to find out
what is going on. We hope their customer relations department is better
than Maytag's. The free-flights fiasco is still hanging over Hoover and
we will persevere to resolve that.''
* The veteran Hoover free-flights campaigner, Mr Sandy Jack, 72, of
Methil, Fife, was recovering at home yesterday after a mild stroke. The
former commando lost a court claim against Hoover in 1993 but has
continued to lobby the company.

AN autograph book bought for a few pennies at the height of the Battle
of Britain is expected to fetch up to #20,000 at action next week.
Its contents make it one of the most poignant mementoes of the Second
World War, inspiring Winston Churchill to observe later: ''It's not a
book of names but a book of heroes . . . God forbid it should ever be
lost.''
The pocket-sized book is signed by 107 British, American, and
Commonwealth airmen, many of whom died in the battle for control of the
skies during the early days of the war.
It was kept by a mess steward at RAF Martlesham Heath in Suffolk,
during 1940 after an idea by flying ace Douglas Bader.
The poignant relic -- dubbed the RAF Book of Heroes and preserved in a
brass-framed casket -- goes on offer at auctioneers Bonhams on June 6.
One page is signed D Bader, S/Ldr. DSO, DFC, BAR and bears a
photograph of the fighter pilot who lost his legs in a flying accident
but went on to become a national hero.

MORE than 1000 doctors in the East of Scotland have been
''accidentally excluded'' from a UK-wide ballot of GPs over their
long-standing grievance with Government about payments for night visits
to patients.
Their professional body, the British Medical Association, yesterday
blamed the omission on a computer programming error.
Correcting the fault will mean a delay in announcing a result which
could bring about another ballot about industrial action.
Dr Fiona Grant, an SNP Fife regional councillor who practises medicine
under her maiden name, DeSoyza, said yesterday that she was disgusted by
the error.
She claimed it would have been picked up much earlier had English GPs
-- rather than doctors working in the Lothians, Tayside, and Fife --
been involved.
A London-based BMA spokeswoman confirmed yesterday that more than 1000
Scottish doctors in the ''East of Scotland region'' had not received
ballot papers on whether or not to accept a new offer on out-of-hours
payments.
Excuses given initially embraced only the recent postal strike in
Scotland and difficulties in keeping tabs on doctors who do not notify
the BMA of changes of address.
Later, it was admitted that the failure was down to ''a big problem''
in the computer programming of the membership sent to the independent
Electoral Reform Society.
It was confirmed also that numerous Scottish doctors had lodged
complaints with the BMA about missing out on the original mailing
programme almost two weeks' ago.
Their voting papers were finally posted yesterday. The BMA, however,
has extended the deadline for returns by just three days -- from June 5
to June 8.
Dr DeSoyza, who believes Scottish doctors are more militant on the
issue than those elsewhere, said: ''I understand the error was
discovered only after individual members alerted the BMA's General
Medical Services Committee that they had not received ballot papers.
''I am naturally disappointed that they managed to 'forget' more than
1000 Scottish doctors. I am quite sure the timescale would have been
different had London doctors been missed out.''
A BMA official said: ''There was a big problem with the computer
programming for GP addresses. This meant that over 1000 doctors in the
East of Scotland region failed to get their ballot papers . . . a lot of
people complained.''
There are 29,706 doctors involved in the ballot, called after the
Department of Health tabled an improved offer last month.
The offer increased, from #9 to #20, the fee for each home visit
between 10pm and 8am, on top of an annual lump sum of #2000 -- a
straight replacement for the current flat fee of #47.85 per visit.
In addition, the Government increased, from #15m to #45m, an offer to
develop alternative ways of providing out-of-hours cover to be spent
supporting GP co-operative services and arrangements for rural doctors
who need reimbursement for locum cover.
Many doctors remain suspicious of a package in which some would
benefit and others lose out. The ballot is on the basis of accept or
reject. If rejected, the BMA will discuss sanctions before a ballot on
industrial action.

FEARS that childhood leukaemia is inherited are dispelled in new
research published today.
The study shows there is no evidence the cancer is passed on through
the generations. Based on a survey of former childhood leukaemia
patients, it reveals that their children very rarely inherit the
disease.
Scientists examined the medical records of 788 survivors of childhood
leukaemia born between 1940 and 1969.
Of the 382 children born to the survivors, none was found to have
developed any type of cancer or leukaemia.
The study, funded by the Cancer Research Campaign and the Leukaemia
Research Fund, also found the proportion of survivors who might pass on
the disease to their offspring was unlikely to be more than 5%, and
probably much lower.
Dr David Grant, scientific director at the Leukaemia Research Fund,
said: ''The continuing improvement in survival for children with
leukaemia gives us great satisfaction.
''It is particularly reassuring that the effects of the intensive
treatments that children undergo will not affect the health of their own
offspring.
''It is also clear that the abnormal genetic changes that caused their
own leukaemia are not passed on to the next generation.''

HEART operations on unborn children are being planned by doctors at
the Queen Mother's maternity hospital in Glasgow.
The operation has been performed successfully only once in the UK --
in England -- but the pioneering Yorkhill foetal medicine unit already
carries out about half-a-dozen other highly specialised in-utero
procedures every year, apart from about 70 foetal blood transfusions and
20-30 blood samples.
At its heart is ultrasound -- developed at Yorkhill 40 years ago by
the late Professor Ian Donald and relocated yesterday in a new #150,000
department. Originally devised for foetal monitoring, its modern
counterpart is used by doctors to guide their instruments.
Dr Alan Cameron, director of the unit, was preparing the latest
transfusion which Donna Wilkinson's son -- due in three week's time --
will receive today.
Mrs Wilkinson, 25, who runs a guest house in Shetland, has been
referred to Yorkhill because she has rhesus factor in her blood which
will cause anaemia in her baby.
''Using real-time ultrasound to guide us, we pick a spot on the
umbilical cord, and draw off some blood,'' Dr Cameron explained. ''We
have a lab next door where it will be tested by scientists from the
genetics department; they will tell us the extent to which his blood is
depleted.
''We put the needle back in and transfuse the appropriate amount from
a cross-matched unit sent up in advance from Law Hospital.''
A suitable case for heart surgery will be a baby with cardiac problems
due to a sticky valve and will be carried out with cardiologists from
the Royal Hospital for Sick Children.
Dr Cameron said: ''An ultra-thin catheter will be inserted into the
womb and through the baby's blood vessels via the umbilical cord, until
it reaches the valve. There, radio frequency waves from tiny wires at
the tip deliver just enough heat to burn through the fused tissue and
free the valve.''

BUENOS AIRES: Stressed-out Argentine bus drivers are lapsing into drug
use in order to work their manic beats in gridlocked Buenos Aires.
Recent court sentences weeks point to a spreading use of cocaine and
marijuana by city bus drivers, who work extremely long hours and are
pushed to finish their runs in record time. They often become frenzied
bullies blamed for the many fatal accidents on the streets of Buenos
Aires.

Johannesburg, Wednesday
ROBBERS have attacked two sports writers in Johannesburg reporting on
the rugby World Cup, a few days after an international risk consultancy
advised tourists to be cautious of South Africa's most dangerous city.
Police said New Zealand's Bob Howitt was pistol-whipped and forced to
hand over cash and credit cards when he walked into his quiet
residential hotel during a robbery.
Barry Glasspool, rugby writer for The Star, one of the leading
newspapers in Johannesburg, was attacked by knife-wielding men as he
entered a city centre arcade.
A few days before the start of the tournament, the London-based
Control Risks Group (CRG) security consultancy advised tourists visiting
South Africa to take all sensible precautions or their holidays would
turn into a nightmare.
''An armed robbery takes place every eight minutes and up to 30 cars
are hijacked each day,'' the group said.
The Safety and Security Minister had ordered the deployment of extra
police and troops to crime flashpoints including those in Gauteng
province, centred on Johannesburg.
More than 50 people, mostly blacks, were murdered every day in South
Africa in 1993 and 1994.
DURBAN: White South African police colonel Louis Botha has been
arrested in connection with several murders in the country's Zulu
heartland in the late 1980s. He will appear in court on July 3.--Reuter.

LONG-term benzene concentrations in the area of the Mossmorran complex
in Fife are low and unlikely to be of any health risk, a new report said
yesterday.
The findings of the Mossmorran and Braefoot Bay independent air
quality monitoring review group were given in its 1994 annual report to
Fife regional councillors meeting in Glenrothes.
The group, which provides advice and recommendations to councils over
air monitoring at the sites, was set up under a special planning
condition imposed after planning consent was given for Shell's third
module development at the site.
Benzene has been linked to cancer and Government experts have set an
acceptable risk level of five parts per billion.
The council's planning and environment committee heard Shell had also
pledged to cut benzene emissions during gasoline loading at Braefoot
Bay. The company has said it intends to instal a vapour recovery system
and has said it will load only when wind speeds are above five knots, to
ensure effective dispersion.
Results from the monitoring survey and dispersion modelling were
generally reassuring, said the report, which claimed the facilities had
little impact on local air quality under most circumstances.
The report said a higher concentration of benzene and other
hydrocarbons had been detected on one occasion last October, when Shell
gasoline was being loaded during unusually calm weather.
Locals expressed concern about the incident but the group said
measurements and preliminary dispersion modelling studies indicated the
long-term concentrations of benzene were low and unlikely to pose any
health risk.
* Shell has applied for planning permission for a #140m expansion of
Mossmorran which it says is vital to safeguard the future of the
complex. The regional council -- which has stressed that public safety
is paramount -- is expected to make a decision later this year.

Rio de Janeiro, Wednesday
A MUDSLIDE demolished about 40 brick-and-tin shanties in the Brazilian
town of Salvador, killing at least 17 people. The death toll could reach
200, residents said.
Rescuers said 12 people had been saved and 300 relief workers were
searching the debris for more survivors.
It was not known how many people were buried by the mudslide, a 150ft
shelf of earth was unleashed after 10 days of heavy rain in the Bom Jua
de Retiro district of Salvador, where about 1.5 million people live in
vulnerable areas.
''There was a heavy tremor and the earth came rushing down on them,''
said Fire Captain Marcelo Alves da Silva.
''Because it was lunchtime, there were a lot of children and their
mothers in there.''
Television footage showed rescuers pulling a dazed six-year-old boy
from the mud and helping him breathe with an oxygen mask. The network
also showed limbs jutting from the earth.
State troopers sealed off the area, fearing another slide.--Reuter/AP.

River Kwai,
THE three old men stood in front of the bridge, threw their arms
around each other, and smiled broadly for the cameras.
To an outsider they might have looked like any group of old friends on
holiday.
However two of these men -- Trevor Dakin and Buntom Wandee -- used to
hate everything for which the third man, Nagase Takashi, stood.
Fifty years ago, Dakin and Wandee nearly died building the infamous
''Death Railway'' between Thailand and Burma, which was constructed by
prisoners of war and men forced into labour by the occupying Japanese
Army.
Takashi, now 75, was an interpreter for the brutal Kempeitai -- the
Japanese military police. Part of his work included helping to
interrogate prisoners under torture.
Dakin, also 75, was a corporal in the British Army who, like thousands
of other prisoners, was sent to Thailand from Singapore in a cattle-car
to work on the railway in 1942.
Wandee, an Indonesian, was a slave labourer brought to Kanchanaburi
near the Thai-Burmese border around the same time.
During the Second World War, the Japanese occupied Thailand and Burma,
and forced Allied prisoners and slave labourers into building the
260-mile railway through the jungle-covered mountains to connect the two
countries.
Atrocious working conditions in the tropical climate coupled with a
near-starvation diet and brutal treatment by the Japanese killed one in
five prisoners of war.
An estimated 16,000 Allied soldiers and at least 90,000 enforced
labourers died in the 16-month construction of the ''Death Railway''.
Takashi says that after the war he had a change of heart about the
Japanese actions, and has spent most of the last half-century trying to
make amends for his role in the brutalities of the war.
In nearly 85 trips back to Thailand from Japan, Takashi has built a
peace temple near the Bridge over the River Kwai, established the River
Kwai Peace Foundation, and donated thousands of dollars in scholarships
to needy children in Kanchanaburi -- the former base camp for
construction of the railway.
''When I was in a grave searching party for three weeks I saw many,
many miserable results of the war and that scene changed my whole
life,'' said Takashi.
It was his destiny, he said, to devote his life to righting wrongs
made during the war.
Takashi recently helped Wandee, who stayed in Thailand after the war,
to get a passport so he could soon return to Indonesia for the first
time.
The former Japanese soldier has also made efforts to meet and
apologise to former prisoners who suffered under the Japanese.
The BBC is now in Kanchanaburi shooting a documentary about one
British soldier who eventually met and made peace with Takashi, his
former interrogator.
Dakin, who says Takashi is a kind man and ''the only Japanese I could
shake hands with'', lauds him for his efforts.
''It's an act of atonement. He'll spend the rest of his life atoning
for what he did,'' Dakin said. ''He witnessed many acts of torture as an
interpreter.''
Dakin moved back to Kanchanaburi eight years ago after visiting in
1986 for the first time since the war in an attempt to ''lay a ghost to
rest''.
He now helps the relatives of the PoWs find their loved ones' graves
and is working with veterans' groups to seek reparation for suffering
during the war.--Reuter.

<TEXT>
BREWING firm Carlsberg-Tetley yesterday recalled more than a million
cans of beer fitted with widgets after a drinker swallowed a piece of
plastic one square centimetre in size.
The company said the action was being taken because of a ''very slight
risk of a loose piece of plastic widget in the can occurring during
packaging''.
Carlsberg-Tetley was alerted to the danger after the man in the London
area sought medical advice over the weekend. He did not need hospital
treatment.
The company expects more than a million cans of Tetley Bitter, Tetley
Mild, Tetley Imperial, Ansells Mild, Ansells Bitter, and Golden Oak to
be returned. The cans are available in pubs, supermarkets, restaurants,
and off-licences.
Carlsberg-Tetley said it was asking for the immediate withdrawal of
the products as a precautionary measure. It has set up a freephone
number for advice: 0800 427533.
All the cans were packaged at the brewery in Burton-upon-Trent,
Staffordshire.
Company communications manager, Ms Linda Bain, said: ''We have
identified the problem as a fault in the packaging process which is
leading to a very small number of cans containing a piece of plastic
widget. We estimate it will affect about one in a million cans but even
one in a million is enough for a total recall.''
The Sainsbury group has recalled all cans of Sainsbury's Burton
Draught Bitter, produced by Carlsberg-Tetley.

GREATER Glasgow Health Board has ordered changes in the running of a
Glasgow nursing home after college students sent there on work
experience complained about the mistreatment of patients.
The students raised their concerns with their tutor at Cambuslang
College, and eventually the health board held an investigation into
Darnley Court nursing home.
One student alleged that bath water was not changed between patients
because the care assistant said it was still warm and proceeded to bathe
a second client in water which had faeces in it.
Students said they were shocked by the way staff taunted and
deliberately confused residents with dementia and made comments which
humiliated and confused patients.
It was also claimed that patients were deprived of food so that there
would be enough left over for staff. A written report by the students'
placement co-ordinator stated: ''The students were able to recall
numerous incidents involving physical, social, and emotional abuse of
residents which were beyond belief.''
The co-ordinator added: ''I believe the students and do not consider
any exaggeration has been used when describing incidents.''
Darnley Court was opened by health care company Associated Nursing
Services 18 months ago. Greater Glasgow Health Board has a 15-year
contract with the company for places for 120 elderly care patients.
After the college passed on the students' allegations, the health
board investigated but found some of the claims difficult to
substantiate.
Mr Geoff Daly, operations director of Associated Nursing Services,
said the accusations were ''wildly inaccurate''. However, it is believed
that, since the allegations, four members of staff have been sacked.
He said one of the Cambuslang students had been counselled by senior
staff at the home about his alleged ''inappropriate verbal and physical
behaviour'' towards other staff.
He added that ANS had found no substance to the allegations.
Although the health board said last night that ''no major
shortcomings'' were identified at Darnley Court, a number of
recommendations for improvements at the home had been made.
These include improving staff deployment, strengthening induction and
orientation training for staff, and further training in care planning.
Health board acting general manager Tom Divers said the board's
registration and inspection team would work with management at Darnley
Court to ensure the recommendations were implemented within three
months.
He has written to relatives of residents at the home, telling them
that the board would continue to monitor performance at the home.

ONLY one Scottish beach nominated for a Seaside Award under the Tidy
Britain Group scheme has failed tough environmental tests. Thirteen
others, 12 on the east coast, were successful.
Sandend beach, on the Moray Firth, a previous winner, was turned down
this year because, according to the judges, ''the approach to the beach
has been disgracefully abused by The Real McKay fish processing plant,
whose lorries consistently block the emergency entrance, the disabled
people's seating/picnic area, and the beach access''.
Mr John Williams, assistant director of leisure and recreation at
Banff and Buchan District Council, said: ''We are really quite upset
that we have lost this award. Sandend has won awards for the last four
years. We have put quite a bit of effort into improving the beach over
the years.
''We have dealt with Mr McKay over a number of years and this is not
the first time that complaints have been made. In the past, we have
always managed to satisfy the judges that our efforts to put the matter
right justified the award but I think that, after a while, they have
become frustrated by our failures to get Mr McKay to improve his
management of the area.''
Mr Williams added that Mr McKay was within his rights to park his
lorries at the side of the plant but they blocked access to the disabled
car park.
Mr McKay said he hoped to relocate his business early next year but
added that it was ''best to say nothing'' about the judges' criticism.
Mr Douglas Wright, director of Keep Scotland Beautiful, the Scottish
arm of Keep Britain Tidy, said he was delighted with the overall
successes of the Scottish beaches, all of which had been nominated for
awards by local authorities, management authorities, or community
councils.
The dominance of the beaches on the east coast was due to their good
water quality standards, he said. Troon South, the only west-coast beach
to win an award, had improved enormously over the years, he added.
Award-winning beaches must meet the EU legal minimum requirement for
water quality, although a number -- six in Scotland -- also met
guideline standards, a higher quality under current EU standards.
Seaside Award beaches will be required to display water quality
results for the past three years, as well as the current season's.
A total of 182 beaches were given awards this year.
They cover both resort and rural beaches and the Tidy Britain Group
administers the European Blue Flag Scheme, open only to resort beaches,
in the UK. Only 18 beaches got Blue Flag awards, none of them in
Scotland.
The following beaches received Seaside Awards: Troon South (resort);
Silver Sands beach at Aberdour (resort); Elie (resort); Kingsbarns
(rural); St Andrews West Sands (resort); Balmedie (rural); Fraserburgh
(resort); Inverboyndie (rural); Water of Philorth (rural); Dornoch
(rural); Nairn, central (resort); Belhaven Bay (rural); and Gullane
Bents (rural).

PUBLIC confidence in state care for the elderly is continuing to
deteriorate, with seven out of 10 people believing that adequate levels
of care will not be provided in 10 years' time, according to a survey.
The report shows that Scots topped the league of those concerned in
the UK, with 77% believing the elderly were not very well cared for in
the current set- up. This compared to 55% last year.
The figures, based on research carried out by PPP Lifetime, a
long-term care insurance group based in Stratford-upon-Avon, reflects
the public's changes in attitude since the introduction of the Community
Care Act in 1993.
The report shows that, before the Act, 51% of adults believed the
elderly were not well looked after by the state. A year later, this
figure had risen to 59%.
New research shows that 67% of the UK population now believes elderly
care is inadequate. Young people represented the most negative group
within the sample. The figures were based on a UK-wide survey of 1001
adults interviewed between April 21 and 23.
Mr Peter Gatenby, the insurance firm's appointed actuary, said nearly
60% of those interviewed originally thought the Community Care Act would
improve care for the elderly. However, that figure had now halved, he
said.
''As far as the future is concerned, there is an increasing level of
pessimism. Seven out of 10 people believe the state will not provide
adequate care for the elderly in 10 years' time,'' he said.
Mrs Ann Garscadden, administrator of the Scottish Pensioners Forum,
which represents pensioners groups across Scotland, said care of the
elderly was a major concern of the forum and would be one of the main
topics discussed at its fourth annual conference in Glasgow tomorrow.
Mrs Garscadden added: ''Concerns have increased partly because of
elderly people's experience and partly because the elderly or their
relatives don't know what the arrangements are either for community care
or care in hospitals since the Act was introduced. Their concerns focus
mainly on the lack of funding for the continuance and improvement of
state care.''
Another survey published today shows that patients of fundholding GPs
are still getting faster hospital treatment despite a Government ban on
queue jumping.
The same report showed that patients of fundholding GPs were
significantly less happy with the service they received than those of
other doctors.
Amid a row over ''fast-track'' treatment, the Department of Health
sent a circular to health authorities telling them patients of
fundholding doctors should not be given an unfair advantage.
Butmore than half the GPs questioned for the survey for Which?
magazine agreed that fundholders' patients were still being treated more
quickly than those of non-fundholders.
More than 75% of all GPs taking part and 45% of fundholders thought
one of the failings of the system was that budgets interfered with
clinical decisions.

Copenhagen, Wednesday
PRINCE Joachim, second son of Danish Queen Margrethe, will marry a
British commoner five years his senior, it was announced today.
The engagement between Joachim, 25, second in line to the Danish
throne after Crown Prince Frederik, and Alexandra Christina Manley, 30,
section head at a Hong Kong investment firm, was disclosed in a press
statement which said the wedding would take place in Denmark in
November.
Miss Manley, a member of the Anglican Church, would convert to the
Danish Lutheran Church and apply for Danish citizenship, the statement
added.
The prince and his fiancee left the Danish Parliament building by car
together with Queen Margrethe and her French-born consort Prince Henrik
after the surprise engagement was approved at a Cabinet meeting chaired
by the Queen.
Joachim, who shares a love of fast cars and sport with his elder
brother, is popular with the Danish public because of his articulate and
outgoing personality.
He attended an ordinary school in line with modern Danish practice,
bringing friends home to the Amalienborg Palace in central Copenhagen.
Joachim was trained as an officer, farmer, and landowner and inherited
in 1993 a castle and estate in south Jutland.
His wife-to-be was trained as an economist at schools in Hong Kong,
London, and Vienna. She is the daughter of Richard and Christa (nee
Nowotny) Manley, who live in Hong Kong. --Reuter.

<HEADLINE>Lord Lovat died knowing that the ancestral home would have to go. Debts force sale of Beaufort Castle</HEADLINE>

THE late Lord Lovat knew before he died that his home and lands,
associated with the Clan Fraser for more than 600 years, would have to
be sold to pay family debts, according to his cousin and estate factor,
Mr Giles Foster.
Mr Foster expressed his view yesterday after news that Beaufort Castle
and 19,500 acres were being put on the market at #6m.
The estate is being offered in 39 lots. The 23-roomed castle on the
site near Beauly has been valued at #1.5m.
Mr Foster said Lord Lovat, the former Commando leader who died in
March, aged 83, knew despite his failing health that parts of the estate
had to be sold. He would have known that this included the sale of the
castle.
The decisions followed the deaths in March last year of his youngest
son Andrew, 42, killed in Tanzania by a wounded buffalo, and his heir,
Simon Master of Lovat, who died a few days later leaving debts of more
than #7.4m.
Mr Foster said yesterday: ''After the sad happenings of the last 18
months, it has become necessary to sell off some parts of the estate in
an attempt to reorganise and make the remaining part viable.
''It is a tragedy for the whole family as you can imagine. We had a
long year of tragedies and this is the culmination of that. I would like
to see the place go to one buyer but I just don't know what will
happen.''
Mr Foster did not envisage any further sales. Around 7000 acres and 60
houses will be left in the family. The new Lord Lovat, an 18-year-old
pupil at Harrow, and the rest of the late Master of Lovat's family, who
formerly lived in the castle when in Scotland, will have the
five-bedroom Beaufort Lodge a few hundred yards away as their Scottish
home.
Lady Lovat will remain in Balblair House nearby, where she and her
husband lived for years after passing over the estate to their eldest
son. It was there that the war hero died on March 16, a year to the day
since Andrew had been killed.
The package for sale includes 2400 acres of fertile farmland; 2900
acres of commercial woodland which also provides shooting; and 27
houses.
The castle is divided into three sections.
The principal apartments include an elegant drawing room, a baronial
dining room, a high Victorian chapel (the Lovats are a prominent Roman
Catholic family), and a ballroom. The family apartments form the east
range and include reception rooms, bedrooms, and original bathrooms. A
service wing lies to the north.
The estate employs a mere handful of workers now, such as shepherd
John Meldrum, who has been there for the past 12 years. He and his wife
did not know where the sale would leave them.
In 1990, the Master sold the salmon fishing rights on the River Beauly
and the 33,000-acre Brauien estate for #15m, a decision that was said to
have angered his father.
Mr Foster made it clear yesterday, however, that many of the castle's
antiques and silverware pieces would be kept in the family, including
Bonnie Prince Charlie's pistols, used at the Battle of Culloden, and a
set of false teeth belonging to the 11th Lord Lovat or MacShimi, who was
beheaded in 1747.
That particular Simon Fraser was the last man in Britain to suffer a
fate reserved for peers of the realm. He had been caught hiding on an
island in Loch Morar in the aftermath of Culloden. His estates were
forfeit and remained so until his son, Simon Fraser, won the lands back
after a special Act of Parliament in 1784 allowed George III to restore
them to the Frasers. The Crown had been impressed by the efforts of the
Fraser Highlanders in North America, particularly Quebec.
That Simon rose to general in the British Army and later became MP for
Inverness-shire. He was to add to the Fraser lands, buying North Morar
and land around Fort Augustus, which also were to add to the family's
debts even at the end of the eighteenth century.
The Lovat Estate sold the 12,000 acres in Morar last autumn to
theatrical impresario Cameron Mackintosh.
The lands on which Fort Augustus Abbey stand cannot be sold for
another 880 years, according to a 999-year lease granted by a later Lord
Lovat to Benedictines. By its terms, the monks pay #1 a year as long as
the property is used for educational or religious purposes.

THE husband of Director of Public Prosecutions was recovering in
hospital last night after the stark reality of Britain's violent streets
was brought to their own doorstep.
Mrs Barbara Mills, QC, found her husband John clutching a knife wound
in his stomach when he returned home from work.
Mrs Mills called an ambulance while the 56-year-old businessman lay in
the hall of their north London home.
She then spent much of the night by his bedside after he was taken to
hospital in Hampstead, where he underwent emergency surgery.
Yesterday, Mrs Mills told reporters: ''He's being very well looked
after. He's stable.''
Mr Mills was attacked on Tuesday night after parking his car just
yards from their home in Camden Town.
He was surrounded by a gang of youths wearing baseball caps and
scarves to hide their faces.
They demanded his wallet and within seconds had fled, leaving Mr Mills
stunned and bleeding.
Neighbour Josephine Matthews said she heard a noise and saw a gang
surrounding Mr Mills.
The youths fled when another car pulled up and Mr Mills started to
walk slowly to the house.
She realised immediately there was something wrong: ''As he looked up,
I saw he had got blood all over his shirt.
''I shouted, 'Are you all right?', and he replied, 'No, I am not, my
wife, my wife'.''
Mrs Matthews ran into the street but, by the time she reached Mr
Mills's house, he was lying in the hall with the front door open.
''There was just a mass of blood across his chest and stomach. It was
quite horrendous. It is just such a shock,'' she added.
Mrs Mills, 54, was full of praise today for the ''fantastic job'' done
by the emergency services.
''They were enormously efficient and helpful and the hospital has been
absolutely superb,'' she told reporters on the steps of the hospital.
''Obviously my husband's state of health is my top priority at the
moment,'' she added.
The couple have been married since 1962 and have four children.
Police were on the scene within minutes. They recovered the wallet and
a knife and soon afterwards they made 11 arrests.
Scotland Yard said the 11 -- four 15-year-olds, five aged 16, one aged
17, and one 21-year-old -- were still being questioned last night at
three police stations in north London.
Mrs Mills, who lists ''my family'' as her recreation in Who's Who, met
her husband at Oxford University.
Called to the bar in 1963, Mrs Mills was director of the Serious Fraud
Office from 1990 to 1992. She was appointed Director of Public
Prosecutions in 1992.
Her husband became a Labour councillor in 1971. He was deputy director
of the London Docklands Development Corporation until he resigned in
l987.

POLICE yesterday issued a computer impression of the man who left an
hour-old baby at an Edinburgh maternity unit.
The picture has been built up from a description of the man who called
at the Eastern General Hospital on Friday night and handed the baby boy
to nurses. They named him Fraser.
The man, who gave his name as Ian Young, said the baby's mother,
Michelle, already had three children and could not cope with another.
He is described as being between 25 and 30, 5ft 9in to 5ft 11in, with
short blond hair and a thick moustache.
He was wearing a black or navy blue V-neck sweater with a brown
diamond pattern, fawn coloured shirt, orange T-shirt, and faded denim
jeans. He was said to have spoken with a broad Edinburgh accent and was
carrying a holdall, in which he carried the baby.
Police are keen to trace the mother and think she could be in need of
urgent medical treatment.
Officers have already issued a description of the child's clothing. He
was wearing a white Babygro with yellow sleeves, blue cuffs, and a teddy
motif, a white hat, and was wrapped in two handtowels, one green, grey,
and white, the other peach, pink, and white.
Anyone with information should contact Portobello Police Station on
0131-311 3038.

<HEADLINE>Safeway closure row referred back to court</HEADLINE>

A JUDGE was asked yesterday to summon two Safeway executives to court
to explain their alleged breach of a court order banning the closure of
an Edinburgh supermarket.
Safeway says that the store is still operating and denies any breach
of the order.
Lord Penrose said he would give the supermarket group until noon
tomorrow to provide information about what was happening at the shop in
Wester Hailes, Edinburgh, and will decide then whether the executives
should be ordered to appear before him.
The shop was due to close last weekend following redundancy notices to
54 members of staff, but last Friday, at the Court of Session, Lord
Penrose granted an interim interdict which in effect ordered the store
to carry on trading.
The order was granted in favour of Highland and Universal Properties
Ltd, the shopping centre landlords.
The judge said that the store, which trades under the Presto name, had
a lease with the landlords which was not due to expire until 2009.
Highland and Universal argued that it had already spent #2.5m out of a
planned #12m improving the centre. Presto was the ''anchor store'' and
the centre would become commercially unattractive if it closed down.
Safeway argued that the centre had been allowed to deteriorate over
the years and that improvement plans had not materialised.
The group pointed out that it had spent #600,000 in 1992 in an attempt
to turn round a drop in business but the trading loss in the last
financial year was about #300,000.
In his ruling last Friday Lord Penrose said that the landlord's
complaint was about conduct which, if it was established, could only be
characterised as a blatant breach of contract.
The short-term financial risk to Safeway of staying open appeared to
be minimal compared to the dangers faced by the landlords if the store
closed.
Yesterday, Highland and Universal returned to court to claim that
Safeway was in breach of last Friday's order.
Mr Jonathan Lake, for the landlords, said that it had become apparent
that Safeway had scaled down the operation at Wester Hailes considerably
and was running the store at approximately one eighth of the available
floor space.
Highland's lawyers had written to Safeway's solicitors asking for
their comments about what was going on and whether the scaling down was
intended to be permanent. No response had been received by noon on
Tuesday.
In those circumstances Highland wanted Safeway executives to be
ordered to appear before the judge to explain why they had not obeyed
his original order that the store must remain open for trading.
Highland was alleging that Safeway was in contempt of court.
Mr Alan Dewar, counsel for Safeway, told the judge that a wide range
of goods was still on sale in the Wester Hailes store, although it was
admittedly operating on a lesser scale.
Safeway denied being in breach of last Friday's order.
He asked for more time to obtain fuller information from his clients
about what was happening at the store and Lord Penrose agreed to give
Safeway until noon tomorrow to provide the details.

MEMBERS of a Free Church congregation were split yesterday over moves
to appoint a controversial minister.
More than one-third of Bon Accord Free Church in Aberdeen voted
against the Rev Professor Donald Macleod.
The colourful theologian was cleared last week at his church's general
assembly, in Edinburgh, of unsubstantiated allegations of misconduct.
It was seen as the end of what had been described as a vicious
whispering campaign which began almost 10 years ago.
However, he is still the subject of a report to the procurator-fiscal
in Edinburgh over an alleged incident involving a woman.
''It would be unheard of in church circles to appoint a minister who
was under investigation by the procurator-fiscal,'' said a leading
church insider.
The well-publicised liberal views of Professor Macleod are not
unanimously welcomed and are threatening to drive a wedge between the
170 members of the congregation of the Aberdeen church.
At a recent meeting they split 52% in favour, with 37% against and 31
written objections.
The charge has been vacant for two years since the Rev Alec Macdonald
moved to Edinburgh.
It is the second biggest charge within the Free Church, contributing
#100,000 last year to church finances.
''If the congregation got a move on, they could easily appoint
somebody else. There are another couple of people who could garner a lot
of support.
''It might be beneficial to have someone who might unite the members
rather than someone controversial,'' said the insider.
It is understood Professor Macleod was on the verge of being appointed
15 months ago when he withdrew his nomination ''in the interests of
unity'' at the last moment.
Recently, his supporters have been urging him to reconsider and he
indicated he was willing to throw his hat into the ring again.
Unable to reach a decision, the congregation consulted the presbytery
who in turn passed it on to the synod and thereby the general assembly.
Last week's general assembly got bogged down in other issues -- not
least Professor Macleod's inquiry -- and the matter will be settled at a
commission on June 21 and 22.
''They will be asked to advise on the call and it rests with them to
say whether it should go ahead or whether they have other advice to
give,'' said the Rev Professor Clement Graham.
Professor Graham is the interim moderator at Bon Accord Free Church,
where he took two services last Sunday.
''It is not often that the advice of the general assembly is sought on
a call,'' he added.
''It would be preferred if there was unanimity in June,'' said church
elder Murdoch Murchison.
''There are other matters that have to be considered before then and
quite a number of the members feel it might be better to wait until that
is settled,'' he added.
As professor of systematic theology at the Free Church College,
Professor Macleod would not be able to take up the appointment until
next summer at the earliest.

ALLEGATIONS of personnel and financial mismanagement at a Borders
further education college have not been proved after two separate
investigations, the Scottish Office announced yesterday.
The Educational Institute of Scotland, which passed a dossier to the
Scottish Office detailing concerns about management matters at the
college, said it was heartened by a commitment to bring about
improvements at Border College, Galashiels.
However, the union's further education officer, Mr Ken Wimbor, warned:
''The institute will be watching developments within the college closely
to ensure that the community, staff, and students can have confidence in
its operation.''
The other lecturers' union, the SFHEA, had also called for an inquiry
into the running of the college after one of its members, Mrs Sandra
Lewis, was made redundant after an ''excellent'' record of service.
An industrial tribunal subsequently awarded her the maximum
compensation, #11,000, for being dismissed unfairly.
The Scottish Education Department investigated several financial
matters which, it said, did not reveal any improprieties.
''With the exception of the absence of the ability to keep track of
the physical location of assets on the assets register, no major
weaknesses in systems and controls at the college were revealed by the
investigations,'' the report said.
The department will monitor the college to ensure that it tightens up
procedures in such areas as vehicle purchasing, issuing invitations to
tender, hospitality procedures, and the employment of part-time staff.
The chairman of the college board of management was also asked to
investigate, and report on, allegations made by members of staff.
The report said more could have been done by management to communicate
with staff during a period of change. Several measures will be taken to
improve matters but, generally, the college served its community well.

<HEADLINE>Workers at Nigg yard to go back</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>978108699</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
STRIKERS at an oil-rig yard voted yesterday to end their week-long
''wildcat' stoppage.
The 650 workers at the American-owned Barmac yard at Nigg, on the
shores of the Cromarty Firth, will go back on Monday.
The row followed a dispute over arrangements for redundancies after
the merger earlier this year with the facility at Ardersier, near
Inverness, the other big fabrication yard in the North of Scotland.
Around 70% of the workforce at Nigg are members of the former
Boilermakers Union, now part of the GMB, whereas all the hourly paid men
at Ardersier belong to the engineering union, the AEEU.
Both unions have been in the Court of Session this week arguing out
aspects of the redundancy arrangements.
The issue is complicated because the Nigg yard has had work in hand
since it opened in 1973, and so some workers have many years of service
there.
In contrast, the Ardersier yard was mothballed for the whole of 1993,
so almost none of the Barmac employees there has long service.
Barmac is a merger of Brown and Root, which previously ran Nigg, and
the Scottish subsidiary of the American offshore contractors McDermott,
which operated the Ardersier yard.
The issue came to a head when it became clear that the Nigg facility
had lost its bid to construct a 19,500-tonne oil platform.

A BUS company has been put off the road by traffic commissioners after
a Department of Transport hearing at Paisley Sheriff Court.
The decision to revoke the licence of Ayrshire-based Wynter-M
Transport Ltd, which ran its private coach hire business from Irvine,
followed spot inspections carried out by officials last August.
They found discrepancies on licence discs on vehicles used for a
school bus service which the firm had introduced only three days
earlier.
Traffic commissioner Michael Betts disqualified the company and its
directors, brothers James and Paul Moore, from holding a PSV operator's
licence for one year.
The ban will take effect from June 14.
The inquiry heard how one coach examined by inspectors had brake shoes
which ''were worryingly worn''.
Mr Betts said the coach had seriously overrun its maintenance period.
He added: ''There is enough concern about bus safety as it is and we
can all construe scenarios of what might have happened.''
Referring to the licence discs, two of which were photocopied, he said
it was ''at worst totally dishonest and at best completely
unprofessional''.
The commissioner said he was satisfied the company was running more
vehicles than it was authorised to do.

<HEADLINE>Bishop calls for tolerance of opinions on homosexuality</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>978108701</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
CHRISTIANS should be more tolerant of each other's opinions on
homosexuality, the Bishop of Edinburgh, the Most Rev Richard Holloway,
said last night.
In the third of his lectures on sexuality, which earlier caused an
outcry over reported comments on adultery, he said there was a wide
spectrum of views on the subject.
Some fundamentalists, particularly in the US, sought to recriminalise
homosexual acts, quoting from Leviticus which advocates participants be
put to death. However, even fundamentalists were selective in acceptance
of scripture.
''This part of Leviticus is what commentators call the Holiness Code
and it lumps a lot of things together and gives them equal status. It is
true that it says a man must not lie with a man, but it also tells us
never to eat meat with the blood in it, nor cut off the hair from our
temples or shave the edge of our beards,'' he said.
He said conservative Christians took the line that such acts were sins
rather than crimes. This was a dominant attitude in the church,
especially in evangelical circles.
''They are often heard to say they love the sinner but hate the sin.
There is no reason to disbelieve them, though they often show their love
for the sinners in ways that the said sinners find puzzling,'' he said.
Liberals who partially accepted homosexuality still found difficulty
in reconciling it with Biblical tradition and could not approve of
same-sex relationships among clergy because of the threat of schism.
''Most churches which have debated this topic have decided that schism
would be a greater tragedy than the present state of indecision, hence
the balancing acts which are too easily dismissed as fudging the
issue,'' he said.
The Christian radical argued that marriage between two adults pledged
to sexual fidelity was as valid for gays as heterosexuals. The church
should bless such relationships, not condemn them.
A fifth view now emerging from gay and lesbian thinkers, and one which
traditionalist Christians would have difficulty even listening to,
argued that sex should not be modelled on permanent relationships.
''They believe that friendship offers a better model, certainly for
gay and lesbian people, and possibly even for the wider human
community,'' the bishop said.
''It certainly seems to be the case that more and more young people
today organise their sexual relationships around the theme of friendship
and not exclusively around marriage.''  Bishop Holloway said the debate
on homosexuality was at an early stage and tolerance of opinions was
required.
''Periods of social change, especially in areas as sensitive as this,
are always extremely painful, but they are part of the reality of being
human.
''While we may continue to disagree with one another over these
issues, we can, I hope, try to listen to one another. If we cannot learn
to agree, let us at least learn to disagree charitably, ackowledging
that the Christian community is no stranger to the conflict of ideas,''
he said.

THE 3500 workers at Rosyth dockyard yesterday took the first steps
towards a ballot for industrial action in a row over pension rights and
redundancy entitlements.
A mass meeting heard claims from trade union official, Mr Jack Dromey,
that commercial pressures being generated by the sale of the Rosyth and
Devonport yards would see 2000 further jobs being lost between the two.
The potentially explosive situation came as it was announced Defence
Secretary Malcolm Rifkind had put back the deadline for bids for the
Rosyth naval base next door to the dockyard.
The workers who gathered at the dockyard gates yesterday morning
endorsed moves for a ballot if a solution on pensions and redundancy
entitlements were not sorted out before the yard is privatised.
There is also concern over how much work will be earmarked for the
yard by the Ministry of Defence.
Mr Dromey, who is running for the post of General Secretary of the
Transport and General Workers' Union, said the MoD and management had
three weeks to sort the problem. He said a meeting with management
yesterday had not come up with any answers and described earlier talks
with MoD officials as ''a farce, a dialogue with the deaf''.
During his address to workers, he said :''Last week also saw it become
clear beyond any doubt that the effect of sale and the commercial
pressures being generated by sale will see 2000 further jobs go at
Devonport and Rosyth taken together.
''Promises made in 1987 and repeated every year since must be promises
kept. Therefore, I am delivering this ultimatum: unless we get
guarantees on pensions, redundancy, and workload, we will ballot our
members on industrial action.
''They have got three weeks to honour these three promises. If they
don't, then we are collision-bound.''
He said legal action would be considered if no solution was reached.
Mr Jack Negus, convener of the joint industrial trade unions at
Rosyth, said the men were rightly concerned over pensions, redundancy
terms, and future work.
Mr David Batty, managing director of Babcock Rosyth Defence Limited
who run the yard, described the meeting with Mr Dromey as useful.
However, he said he had no idea where Mr Dromey's figures of around
2000 job losses had come from.
Mr Batty said: ''It has been public knowledge that around 700 jobs
would go here by the turn of the century. Of course, we realise a degree
of concern within the workforce over things like pensions.
''We are unable to get fuller dialogue until we complete talks with
the Ministry of Defence, who own the assets here, on a number of issues
which are complex and take time to be resolved.
''The workers at Rosyth have the right of terms and conditions and we
are not just going to change them. For a period of time, we have been
discussing with the Ministry proposals to make us more competitive and
secure jobs which we will put forward for discussion.
''We are happy to open talks with the trade unions within the next two
weeks.''
Meanwhile, interest in the naval base next door has pleased Scottish
Office chiefs. Offers from all over the world have already been lodged
and more are expected.
A spokesman for Ryden, the consultant selling the base on behalf of
the MoD, said: ''In view of the considerable interest being shown in the
base and the relatively high number of interested parties, the closing
date for offers has been deferred from May 31 until July 28 to give
parties more time to carry out detailed investigations.''

THE Lanarkshire Development Agency is to become the second largest
local enterprise company in Scotland as a result of boundary changes
announced yesterday by the Scottish Office.
The alterations to the Lecs network are designed to mirror the shape
of local government after next April's reform.
Under the new regime, the LDA will inherit Cumbernauld, Kilsyth, and
part of Strathkelvin from Dunbartonshire Enterprise, and areas of
Cambuslang and Rutherglen from the Glasgow Development Agency.
In terms of population, it will gain about 180,000 people, pushing its
total to 612,000, while the GDA's tally is reduced to 603,000.
Lothians and Edinburgh Enterprise still has the biggest population, at
about 755,000.
While officials were yesterday dismissing the population change as of
limited relevance, the new boundaries do mean that the LDA will be the
only Scottish Lec covering two new towns, East Kilbride and Cumbernauld,
with their strong tradition of inward investment and job creation.
At the GDA, officials were playing down the significance of the
agency's ''demotion'' and said it would not materially affect its role
of economic regeneration for Glasgow.
At Dunbartonshire Enterprise, the Scottish Secretary's announcement
met with a mixed reaction. Privately, officials were understandably
disappointed at losing Cumbernauld, but relieved at the rejection of a
more radical proposal which would have seen the agency disbanded.
The reshaping of the boundaries was based on recommendations by the
main board of Scottish Enterprise. Outwith the west of Scotland, the
Lecs' geography will remain unchanged.

MEDIA tycoon Robert Maxwell was barely dead when his sons and two
senior executives devised a plot to rescue the family business empire by
fraudulently dealing in employee pension fund shares valued at #22m, it
was claimed at the Old Bailey yesterday.
It was a desperate bid to save the Maxwell empire from collapse.
Kevin and Ian Maxwell, together with the two key executives, are
accused of conspiring to defraud pensioners following the death at sea
of the newspaper publisher who owned the Daily Mirror, Daily Record, and
Sunday Mail.
However, the employee pension funds had been swindled on an even
larger scale shortly before Maxwell's death, the jury was told.
The publisher, together with his youngest son Kevin, had already
conspired illegally to use pension fund assets worth #100m in an attempt
to stave off debtors, it was alleged.
The jury was told that Robert Maxwell was the driving and dominant
force in the group and over his company's pension schemes.
Mr Alan Suckling, QC, described the parlous state of companies run by
Maxwell in the second half of 1991.
A jury of seven women and five men heard that the companies controlled
by Maxwell were in debt and in increasing financial difficulties,
finding it harder and harder to pay their bills.
It was in these circumstances that pension fund shares were used
illegally as collateral as a means of raising loans to save the media
empire, the jury was told.
Mr Kevin Maxwell, 36, denies conspiring with his father to defraud the
trustees and beneficiaries of pension schemes by dishonestly putting at
risk 5,400,000 shares in the Israeli Scitex company. These shares, the
jury was told, were valued at #100m.
He, his brother Ian, 38, Mr Robert Bunn, 47, and Mr Larry
Trachtenberg, 42, are also accused of conspiring to defraud the pension
schemes by dishonestly putting at risk 25,196,228 shares in Teva
Pharmaceuticals, another Israeli company. These shares were valued at
#22m. All four plead not guilty to this charge.
Mr Suckling told the jury that Robert Maxwell and his son Kevin had
agreed to use the Scitex shares to help out companies owned directly or
indirectly by Maxwell interests.
''To that end, the Maxwells used the Scitex shares to meet the debts
of the privately-owned companies without paying the pension funds for
them,'' he said.
''This was dishonest and a fraud on the pensioners.''
In November 1991, after Maxwell's death, the position of the
publishing empire was desperate. All four defendants tried to keep the
companies from collapse by using Teva shares to raise funds from the
National Westminster Bank, prosecuting counsel told the jury. This too
was a fraud against pensioners.
Mr Ian Maxwell's wife was in court as the trial got under way. Mr
Kevin Maxwell's wife was not.
Mrs Maxwell heard Mr Suckling declare that while Mr Kevin Maxwell
worked under the dominant control of his father, he was nevertheless
closely involved in the financial affairs of the group. ''In the second
half of 1991, he dealt on a daily basis with the banks who lent to the
group,'' counsel said.
''Of the four defendants, he was the one most responsible for the
misuse of pension fund assets.''
Chartered accountant Robert Bunn, deputy managing director of finance
of the Robert Maxwell Group, although subservient to the Maxwell
brothers, was closely involved in the group's affairs.
Financial adviser Larry Trachtenberg, originally responsible for fund
management, later worked closely with Kevin Maxwell in an attempt to
deal with the group's financial setback.
Mr Ian Maxwell dealt mainly with publishing, marketing, and sales but
he attended crucial company meetings in the summer of 1991 and became
closely involved in coping with the crisis after his father's death.
The judge, Mr Justice Phillips, had begun proceedings by telling the
jury that there had been objectionable and unfair publicity surrounding
the case.
In particular, it had been suggested that the defendants should not be
receiving legal aid. The costs of the case would be very heavy but that
was not the fault of the defendants, he said.
Legal aid was not handed out to anyone who asked for it.
Mr Kevin Maxwell had been rendered bankrupt and both he and his
brother had demonstrated to the authorities they were unable to meet the
costs of their defence.
''In England, we do not have trial by media, we have trial by judge
and jury,'' the judge added.
The trial, which is expected to last six months, continues today.

FALKIRK Football Club yesterday revealed plans for a move from
Brockville to a greenfield site.
It is at Westfield Farm, between Falkirk and Grangemouth and close to
the Middlefield area where the club originally planned to set up their
new home.
Council officials will smooth the way as quickly as possible.
A planning application to Falkirk District Council yesterday revealed
chairman George Fulston's ambitions.
The Middlefield planning application has been scrapped. It is believed
that problems over the lease of the land could not be resolved.
The new plan includes a 15,000 all-seater stadium, an all-weather
sports pitch, training field, six-a-side pitches, car and coach parking,
and landscaping.
The site is next to the new Laurieston link road which means easy
access to the stadium for fans travelling by the M9.
Members of the public now have 21 days in which to lodge objections to
the scheme.
The public consultation process also will involve Central Regional
Council, the police and fire brigade in a working group set up by the
council.
The application is expected to go before the development services
committee on August 1.
Falkirk District Council's leader, Mr Dennis Goldie, a keen football
fan, said last night: ''There are statutory procedures we must follow
with every planning application. But we realise time is pressing for the
club.
''We will therefore do everything possible, within legal constraints,
to deal with this application as quickly as possible.''
Mr Fulston said last night: ''Middlefield was a tremendous site. But
when I arrived here last year I discovered that there were problems with
the lease of the land. So we had to get our thinking caps on again.''
He hoped the first phase of the #5.5m project -- the stadium plus
parking for 1600 cars and 120 buses -- would start in October.
If construction is on schedule, the club will play their first home
match of the season at the new stadium in August 1996.

THE company behind a controversial plan to build a private care home
for the elderly mentally ill in Irvine plans to increase its role in the
NHS in Scotland, a senior official said last night.
Speaking for the first time since a contract was signed between Irvine
Care and Ayrshire and Arran Health Board for the 90-bed unit, project
director Neil Brady said he sympathised with local concerns but urged
people to wait and see what was being offered.
Mr Brady, based at parent company Speciality Care in London, said his
company was already working closely with a number of health boards in
the UK and that it planned to increase its work in specialist fields of
long-term care such as psycho-geriatric, head injuries, and care of the
disabled.
The health board has been attacked for signing a deal with the private
sector for a facility which many feel should have stayed firmly within
the NHS.
Mr Brady said: ''There is always concern and a certain mistrust when
something new comes along and we have experienced this in various parts
of the UK. Often it is because people do not know what we have to offer
and, in the coming months at Irvine, we will be putting that right by
telling staff and families who care for the patients involved exactly
what our plans are.
''I am confident that, when we have a manager in place, someone with
an NHS background whom we hope to recruit locally, we can begin the real
business of getting the message across that we have a lot to offer.''
Mr Brady, a former NHS trust chief executive in South London, said the
health board had acted ''quite correctly'' in placing the contract with
his company and dismissed claims that it should have gone to the local
NHS trust.
He added: ''The trusts have finite resources and have to make a return
on their investment. So do we but we have far greater liquidity and can
put together a building of this scale and quality far more quickly.
''We have an agreement with the health board over transfer of staff
and it is vitally important that there is continuity of staff. I believe
that patients, staff, and families will benefit from this unit, which
takes the care of the elderly mentally ill forward into the next
century.''
Mr Brady said Irvine Care had been formed, as a subsidiary of his
company, to trade in Scotland and added that he saw ''little
significance'' in links the company had with US health care giant
Integrated Health Services. He added: ''It is true to say that IHS has a
financial interest in our company but we are a separate UK entity and
all negotiations with UK health boards are conducted by myself and other
directors.''
Trade union negotiators remain unconvinced, however. Unison's Margaret
Jamieson said the bulk of her members were not keen to make the shift to
Irvine Care and that there remained ''a considerable gap'' between the
company and unions.
She added: ''Already it is becoming clear that the staffing levels
they have in mind do not match present regimes of care for this type of
patient. We have a lot of work to do on that subject alone.
''In addition, I hear the health board talk about protection for our
members from the EU rules on transferring into the private sector. That
is just so much talk unless we can have a firm undertaking from the
company with an agreed time-scale. They have a 15-year deal with the
health board worth millions, so we will be asking for a 15-year deal for
the nursing and ancillary staff.
''This is another example of the creeping privatisation of the NHS but
if we have to negotiate with these companies, we will be ensuring the
very best terms.''

A YOUTH is to appear at Camden Youth Court, north London, today
charged with robbing the husband of the Director of Public Prosecutions.
The unemployed 17-year-old, who has no fixed address, was charged last
night, Scotland Yard said.
Ten other youths who were assisting police have been given bail for 14
days.
The youth is charged with the theft of Mr John Mills's wallet in
Albert Road, Camden.
Mr Mills, 56, was recovering in hospital last night. Mrs Barbara
Mills, QC, the Director of Public Prosecutions, found her husband
clutching a knife wound in his stomach when he returned home from work.
Mrs Mills, 54, called an ambulance while her husband lay in the hall
of their London home. She praised the emergency services for their
''fantastic job''.
She told reporters: ''They were enormously efficient and helpful and
the hospital has been absolutely superb.''
The couple have been married since 1962 and have four children.

SIR Bob Reid, who recently vacated the hot seat at British Rail, is
taking a new job without pay to put, as he says, something back into
Fife. He was born in Cupar.
He will be chairman of Rosyth 2000, the consortium of leading Scottish
companies bidding for the MoD land holding at the Rosyth Naval Base.
Sir Bob, a former chairman and chief executive of Shell UK, was under
fire earlier this week over the revelation that, in his last year at
British Rail, his basic salary was boosted to more than #200,000 thanks
to a #75,000 performance bonus.
Commenting on his new, unremunerated challenge, Sir Bob described it
as a chance to put something back into Fife. ''I am delighted and
honoured to be given the chance,'' he said.
''The success of Rosyth 2000 is crucial for the future well-being of
the region and will play an important role in the development of the
Scottish industrial community well into the next millennium,'' he went
on.
The consortium brings together Babcock International, Bank of
Scotland, ScottishPower, and Forth Ports, collectively aiming to acquire
and develop the largest single industrial site in Scotland.
Mr Gavin Masterton, deputy treasurer of Bank of Scotland, who has
chaired the consortium since it launched its bid for Rosyth, now becomes
Sir Bob's deputy. Mr Masterton said Sir Bob Reid's expertise and
standing in the business community would benefit the consortium.
Councillor John MacDougall, leader of Fife Regional Council, welcomed
Sir Bob's arrival at the project's helm: ''Sir Bob is well known to us
in Fife. He will bring added strength to the company in its bid to
acquire the Rosyth Naval Base.''
The deadline has now passed for the submission of formal bids to buy
the 355-acre site, expected to raise around #15m for the Defence
Ministry. Rosyth 2000 is known to want to buy the dockyard site next
door as well and lease it back to operator Babcock.
The consortium has plans to invest #100m and create an estimated 2000
jobs over 10 years. It faces tough competition from rival bidders from
as far away as India and the United States. UK construction companies
and port operators like Clydeport are also thought to be interested in
acquiring Rosyth.

THE gas industry's regulator, Ms Clare Spottiswoode, faces questioning
by MPs after claims that she is seeking a 65% pay rise.
Mr Richard Caborn, Labour chairman of the Commons trade and industry
committee, said he had ''no doubt'' that MPs would want to question her
about the pay claim when she appeared before it within weeks. She is due
before the committee on July 5 to discuss the Ofgas annual report.
Ms Spottiswoode's present salary is estimated at around #70,000. No
pay details for the watchdogs of water, gas, electricity, phones, and
rail are published by the Government, despite their salaries being
funded by the taxpayer.
Ofgas said Ms Spottiswoode's pay was negotiated with the Government.
It did not deny that a claim for a 65% rise had been submitted to Mr
Michael Heseltine, President of the Board of Trade.
Ofgas itself seemed to support the move. It issued a statement saying
it was appropriate for Ms Spottiswoode's salary to be ''brought into
line'' with other regulators.
Whitehall sources pointed to other regulators who were paid ''#100,000
and upwards''.

<TEXT>
BRITISH Gas chiefs yesterday endured a five-hour roasting from irate
shareholders over the issue of boardroom pay.
In an unprecedented show of shareholder revolt, some 7000 at the
company's annual meeting even refused to back the reappointment of chief
executive Cedric Brown.
It was his 75% pay rise which led to a nationwide outcry over
boardroom ''greed''.
Shareholders also rejected four other directors, including finance
director Roy Gardner, on a show of hands.
They backed rebel motions calling for the company to rethink its whole
executive pay policy and to set up an advisory group, including
shareholders, unions, and consumers, to question chairman Richard
Giordano and Mr Brown over pay and other issues.
Despite the overwhelming support of the meeting, however, the board
already had enough proxy votes from big institutional shareholders to
stay in power. Support from the big shareholders such as insurance
companies and pension funds overturned the decisions taken by those who
attended the meeting at the London Arena.
Joseph Lamb, a retired Scottish medical professor, complained that the
board had acted like spoilt children by pressurising City institutions
to support them so that they could get their own way.
''It is clear to everyone, apart from your friends in the City, that
the board has been a shambles over the way they have handled pay, the
workers, and shareholders,'' said Professor Lamb, who proposed one of
the critical motions.
Mr Giordano and Mr Brown were despised by most of the country, he
added, accusing them of using their proxies in the way in which union
leaders of the 1970s had wielded their block votes.
His motion was seconded by the Scottish National Party leader, Mr Alex
Salmond, who said British Gas had become a byword for executive greed.
Another MP to address the meeting was Labour's Ken Livingstone.
Looking squarely at the board, he asked: ''If this is the best money can
get, I'd like to see the worst.''
He was acting for a New York pension fund and held the proxy vote for
almost three million shares which he said he would be casting against
the directors.
Mr Livingstone described the demonstration of shareholder democracy at
the meeting as ''the most interesting thing to come to Docklands since
the Kray gang''.Other comments from the floor were equally colourful and
several times Mr Giordano rebuffed them as defamatory.
One man called for the dismissal of the whole board, one woman
suggested deducting #1 from the chairman and chief executive's pay for
every complaint received from customers, and one man was applauded when
he told Mr Giordano: ''You are dispensable.''
Another shareholder, referring to complaints about customer service,
price increases, and job cuts, as well as the thorny subject of pay for
directors, said: ''Never before has a bunch of 14 directors made so many
boo-boos in any one year.''
Tax inspector Andrew Gibson, from Glasgow, waved a P45 -- the tax form
given to employees when they leave work -- and offered it to the board.
''That's the reward for your performance,'' he told the directors.
It was Mr Brown's pay rise and the new long-term incentive scheme for
executives that triggered most of the anger.
In a half-hour opening address to the meeting, Mr Giordano said
boardroom pay at British Gas had been relatively low in the past and had
to be brought into line with other large companies to retain and
motivate the right people.
The pay review had accompanied a shake-up in the business involving
the loss of 25,000 jobs, prompted by the opening up of its former
monopoly position to competition.
Mr Brown had a very difficult job as head of Britain's eighth biggest
company, steering it through the huge restructuring programme, said Mr
Giordano.
''If we had to recruit a new chief executive, we would have to pay
more than Cedric Brown.''
Mr Brown made it clear he had no intention of going, despite tempting
offers from executive headhunters.
Asked by one shareholder if he was prepared to resign, he replied
firmly: ''No''.
One shareholder tried to put a motion of no confidence in Mr
Giordano's handling of the meeting but the chairman ruled it out of
order.
Calls for TV cameras and radio reporters to be allowed in were also
brushed aside. The chairman said it was a private meeting and they would
add nothing to its conduct.
Mr Brown was accused of misleading a Commons committee over the new
executive pay scheme, but he emphatically denied the suggestion.
The turnout at yesterday's meeting is likely to go into the Guinness
Book of Records as the biggest for any company's annual meeting.
Last year, only 614 shareholders turned up, but the controversy over
pay persuaded many more to make the journey this year.

Dublin
THE Prince of Wales, in Dublin at the start of the first official
royal visit to the Irish Republic, last night backed the peace process
in Ireland.
At a dinner in Dublin Castle -- the former seat of British rule --
given by Irish Prime Minister John Bruton, the Prince said: ''For the
first time in a generation there is the prospect of lasting peace
throughout this island.''
During his speech and in an apparent reference to the murder by the
IRA in 1979 of his great-uncle, Earl Mountbatten of Burma, the Prince
spoke of ''misunderstanding, sorrow, and personal tragedy'' which had
touched ''people of every kind''.
He said he had ''longed for many years'' to visit Ireland and
considered it a ''special honour'' to be Mr Bruton's guest.
''I know that the circumstances which allow me to be here result not
least from the courage and imagination shown by you and your predecessor
(former Irish premier Albert Reynolds), and by the Tanaiste (Deputy
Prime Minister Dick Spring),'' he told Mr Bruton.
Welcoming the prospect of lasting peace, he said: ''These are
momentous days. The determination to build on that prospect is evident
in both north and south. Of course, our shared history over the
centuries cannot be set aside lightly.
''As we work together as good neighbours and friends, we are all
deeply conscious of what has gone wrong over the centuries. There has
been so much misunderstanding, sorrow, and personal tragedy, which has
touched people of every kind.
''I can imagine myself, so well, the feelings this history can still
evoke.''
Mr Bruton said the Irish people welcomed the prince ''as a friend'',
against a background of ''hope and quiet optimism''.
The Irish leader went on: ''We are conscious also that your presence
here has a symbolic resonance. It speaks of the growing maturity in the
relationships between the peoples of these islands.''
Security for the visit is tight, with armed members of Ireland's
SAS-trained Emergency Response Unit acting as a royal bodyguard. Up to
4000 police and military personnel are on full alert for the visit. A
ring of steel surrounded the military air base at Baldonnel, near
Dublin, where the prince's RAF Royal Squadron jet landed.
The Prince visited Glencairn, the residence of Mrs Veronica
Sutherland, Britain's first woman ambassador in Ireland, for a reception
to celebrate the Queen's official birthday.
Opponents of the visit staged a rally outside the city's General Post
Office, followed by a march by almost 2000 demonstrators to Dublin
Castle.

Washington
BRITAIN is to set up a rapid reaction strike force to provide
additional firepower to counter attacks on United Nations peacekeepers
in Bosnia, Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind announced last night.
The new ''theatre reserve force'' to deal with troublespots which
flare up in the war zone emerged as US President Bill Clinton said he
would consider sending US troops to help move UN forces to safer
positions.
Mr Rifkind, at the end of the Commons emergency debate on Bosnia, said
the force commanded by Brigadier Graham Pringle would be able to respond
robustly to any threat and could also provide a strong escort to relief
convoys.
The UN commander, General Rupert Smith, is forming it by concentrating
units of British UN forces already in Bosnia to which will be added
artillery and armoured units on their way from Britaian or already
established in Croatia.
It will act as a bridging force until the arrival of the 24 Air Mobile
Brigade which should be assembled in former Yugoslavia in the next few
weeks.
When all units of that are available to him General Smith will have a
powerful force of around 7000 men which the Serbs are likely to think
twice about confronting.
Foreign Office Minister Douglas Hogg said last night it would be very
welcome if American ground troops were deployed temporarily to help the
peacekeepers.
''It is likely there will be a degree of redeployment if only to pull
back some of our most exposed people, for example those who look after
the weapons control points or, for example, the military observers,'' he
told BBC Radio 4.
''It is likely there will be a request to the Americans, if they have
shown a willingness to deploy American ground troops, for them to come
in and help.''
The United States' message that it might assist European allies if
they decided to regroup UN forces in Bosnia came as Britain delivered a
stern warning to Bosnian Serb forces holding hostages.
In the past, Mr Clinton had said only that the US would help in the
evacuation of UN troops if it became necessary. His statement yesterday
means that the Americans are rejecting the proposal that the UN should
cut its losses and pull out of Bosnia.
His new position implies strongly that the US would now help rescue
any UN troops held hostage by the Serbs, and at the very least provide
cover and assistance if they are now grouped together in defendable
sites instead of being scattered around Bosnia.
He said that so far the UN had not requested American help and he had
made no decision yet to send in American forces. ''We have obligations
to our Nato allies,'' he said, ''and I do not believe we can leave them
in the lurch.''
An aircraft carrier carrying an elite unit of 2000 US Marines moved to
the Adriatic this week.
The Dutch have also volunteered a company of marines and the Canadians
and New Zealanders already in Bosnia could also contribute.
The initiative by General Smith cheered many MPs on both sides of the
Commons. Others were more doubtful that it might just be another step
deeper into a Balkan morass from which it could become harder to
extricate British forces.
Mr Rifkind denied there was any question of Bosnia becoming a British
or UN Vietnam. The difference, he said, was that the US had been seeking
to defeat an enemy. That was not the position of the UN in Bosnia.
The Speaker, Miss Betty Boothroyd, disallowed a vote on procedural
grounds which Mr Tony Benn and others had hoped to force in order to
record their dissatisfaction with the Government's handling of the
situation.
Later Mr Tam Dalyell, Labour MP for Linlithgow, who would have been
one of the critical voters, said: ''The debate has left some of us with
an added sense of unease at where we are going and where we might end
up.''
Earlier, Mr John Major and Mr Tony Blair presented a united front on
Bosnia in the Commons, insisting the UN must stay to prevent war
spreading as underlying tensions on Britain's role broke to the surface.
Mr Major dismissed the possibility of withdrawal, saying that if the
UN pulled out, war would engulf the Balkans.
This was complicated by the surprise resignation of Lord Owen,
Europe's negotiator in the conflict, who said that if a political
solution was not found by the autumn, he feared the UN would have to
leave.
Mr Major's position was also opposed by former Prime Minister Sir
Edward Heath, who said the crux of the whole matter was ''are you
prepared to go to war? The answer is no''.
Unusually, he was cheered by several right-wing Conservative back
benchers who later called for British troops to be pulled out as soon as
possible.
The recall of both Houses of Parliament -- for only the 13th time
since the Second World War -- was a clear demonstration of the gravity
with which the Government was treating the crisis.
In Bosnia itself, a heavy outburst of fighting yesterday and reports
that Serbs dressed as peacekeepers were on the loose in Sarajevo added
to tensions.
Bosnian Serbs offered new talks on an old offer: releasing the
hostages in exchange for a promise of no more Nato attacks.
In the Commons, Mr Major angrily refused to bow to Bosnian Serb
''blackmail''.
He pledged ''unremitting'' secret efforts to secure freedom for the 33
soldiers and one RAF officer taken captive in retaliation for UN air
strikes on Serb positions.
Downing Street later refused to elaborate but it seemed clear that all
options -- from the use of military force to diplomatic pressure --
would be kept open.
The Prime Minister told MPs that British troops would remain in the
field unless the risks became ''wholly unacceptable''.
He assured the country and relatives of the British hostages that if
some time went by without any action appearing to be taken, this would
not mean the men had been forgotten. ''The work to secure their release
will be unremitting,'' he said.
Mr Major said the way ahead could be ''rocky and painful'' and
acknowledged that pressure for withdrawal might grow. However, he said,
''withdrawal is not a policy. No-one should believe that leaving Bosnia
would end the UK's interest in this conflict''.
The result could be loss of life on a massive scale and he doubted if
the West could stand by while a ''nightmare'' war spread through the
Balkans. They would have to find other ways to respond to such a
conflict ''which could conceivably impose a greater financial and
military burden on us than we are now carrying''.
He fiercely rejected a call from Tory right-winger Mrs Teresa Gorman
for consideration of the Serb offer to return the hostages if Nato
promised to end air attacks, telling her: ''I am not entering into that
kind of blackmailing deal.''
Mr Blair supported the Government's immediate actions and said the
Bosnian Serb leaders would be pursued ''without any let or quarter
whatever'' if any harm came to the British hostages. He branded talk of
withdrawal as ''deeply unhelpful'' and ''hardly a message of firm
resolve in the face of what is effectively an act of coercive
blackmail''.
He agreed with Mr Major that the present conflict had potential to
involve other countries such as Greece, Turkey, Albania, Bulgaria,
Romania, and Hungary. The Western allies could not just ''walk away''.
Both men stressed the need for fresh diplomatic efforts to secure a
settlement and the importance of obtaining from the Yugoslav President
Milosevic recognition of Bosnia Herzegovina which the Prime Minister
said should lay to rest ''the fears or ambitions'' for a Greater Serbia
and send an unmistakeable message to the Bosnian Serbs.
Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown declared: ''Our first duty is
quite clear at the moment. It is to those who are now in Serb hands. And
nothing we say in this debate should damage their chances of return.
''And nothing we decide to do in the longer term can be put into
practice until they have returned.''
Lord Owen, the former Labour Foreign Secretary and SDP leader, warned
that Britain and the UN were in danger of being ''sucked into'' a Balkan
war. He said increasing quantities of humanitarian aid were being
highjacked by the combatants.
He had sent his resignation as EU negotiator to President Chirac of
France which held the EU presidency, effective from the end of June.

DAVID BELCHER talks to a young musician who gives free rein to his
talents in a busy schedule
A CONVERSATION with Martyn Bennett touches on many topics. Whether or
not all horses trot in 6/8 time; the rhythmic and melodic similarities
between indigenous musics from far-off lands; how being a folk musician
is, against the odds, quite hip these days.
Bennett is a 24-year-old violin-player and piper, born in Newfoundland
and mostly raised in Kingussie. At the time of hisbirth, his academic
Scottish parents were both working in Canada. His mum was, in fact,
studying the influence of Gaelic emigrants on Newfoundland's native Mic
Mac tribe. So maybe it's no surprise that Bennett is motivated by a
spirit of pan-Caledonian cross-fertilisation.
His curriculum vitae starts by describing itself as a brief one, but
then goes on to fill seven, closely-typed pages. Martyn Bennett has
crammed a lot of musical activity into his life, you see. Here are some
selected news-highlights.
He studied classical violin at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and
Drama, graduating in 1993. Last summer he toured the American west coast
with folk-rockers Wolfstone. He has recorded with ambient-Celtic-house
merchants Mouth Music, and also featured on the music for the well-kent
TV ad for Drambuie, crafted by Mouth Music's Martin Swan.
Bennett's piping once welcomed Tanzanian President Julius Nyrere to
Edinburgh. In Auld Reekie at Hogmanay, his bare-chested fiddling warmed
80,000 revellers in Princes Street, and he scored Tom McGrath's
stage-adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson's Kidnapped at Edinburgh's
Lyceum Theatre.
He is at present involved with the theatre again which, in a
roundabout way, is why he is sure that all horses trot in 6/8. He has
composed the music for the Traverse's production of David Harrower's
Knives In Hens, opening at the Traverse tomorrow prior to a tour of the
Highlands and Islands.
Horses don't feature directly in the play's three-strong cast, but
they do figure in Bennett's music, which he will be performing on
violin, flute, viola and keyboard throughout the play's run. ''There are
two parts to the music. I draw upon a folk element because the play is
about rural tradition to an extent.
''But the play also has a sinister element, so I've sampled a lot of
ambient, organic sounds from a range of sources and looped them. The
wind blowing through a creaking tree. The jingling of horses' yokes . .
. I went out with a DAT and recorded a lot of horses, and they all seem
to trot at the same tempo.
''A lot of the play's action takes place in a mill, so I've tried to
create the notion of industrial sound with a sense of antiquity to it.
And the play's three characters -- the miller, the ploughman, and the
ploughman's wife -- are all closely integrated, so I've tried to
establish musical themes for each of them. I've linked the miller to the
viola, the ploughman to the violin, and the wife to the flute.
''I've not created a score as such, as I did for Kidnapped, because I
think it's anathema to live theatre . . . if you're controlling what the
actors are doing creatively.''
Of late, Bennett's creative processes have been taken up by his own
album, mb, recorded for an Edinburgh label and currently being
considered as a licensing proposition by a couple of major London
labels. ''I'm not an expert on hip hop or progressive house, but what
I've done is a hard progressive house LP.''
He has also written a sextet for the Edinburgh Quartet. ''I've added
smallpipes and flute, which is me, and Tom Bancroft on percussion, and
taken some traditional tunes and really screwed them up -- which might
be the wrong way of putting it.''
Bennett also plays live in Edinburgh every second Sunday afternoon at
the Basement in Broughton Street in Salsa Celtica. ''It's the baby of
Chilean guitarist Gallo Ceron. Gallo always says: ''Sure this is salsa
music . . . salsa is a sauce with everything in it . . . and this is a
Scottish salsa, even though it's Latin.''
Internationally indigenous: it's a good way to be.
