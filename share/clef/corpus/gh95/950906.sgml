Robert Dickson reveals the link between the murder of a Glasgow police
officer, and the hanging of 19-year-old Derek Bentley in 1953
A SERIES of programmes on Channel 4 last month dealt with the use of
the death penalty in various countries over the past 50 years. It
included another screening of the film Let Him Have It which recalled
the events leading up to the murder of a police officer by 16-year-old
Christopher Craig, and the subsequent execution of his 19-year-old
companion, Derek Bentley.
For Craig, a callous thug who gloried in his crime and whose only
expressed regret was that he had failed to shoot more policemen, there
was no real defence at all. Only his age prevented the court from
imposing the supreme penalty and few would have striven to save him had
he been old enough to be treated as an adult.
In Bentley's case the position was different. His involvement and what
led to his being hanged on January 28, 1953, was the jury's belief that
on the fateful night of November 2, 1952, he had incited Craig to use
the gun by shouting out the words which form the film's title. He was
accordingly held to be equally responsible for the consequences when
Craig shot an unarmed police officer after he and Bentley had been seen
during a bungled break-in to a factory.
Bentley's defence that he had not said the words, and that at the time
he had already been taken into custody by another police officer was
rejected by the jury which, however, differentiated between the two
accused by asking that mercy should be shown towards the older man.
The decision to ignore that recommendation caused, and still causes
controversy. Forty years after her brother's death, Iris Bentley
obtained a partial pardon for him when it was accepted by the Home
Office that the then Home Secretary, Sir David Maxwell Fyfe, should have
advised the Queen to reprieve him. Such a decision would, however, have
run contrary to the view of the presiding judge, the Lord Chief Justice
of England, Lord Goddard, whose authority and influence over post-war
criminal law in England was considerable.
Two of the reasons expressed at the time, and since, for the refusal
to save Bentley were the perceived needs to deter young men from
carrying lethal weapons and the requirement to show support for the
police in their difficult task. Both are laudable aims, but I wonder if
Sir David, a Scot who retained an interest in his roots and its news,
may not have been influenced by another case which had equally tragic
consequences.
Edwin Finlay had always been regarded as a normal 18-year-old. An only
child, he lived with his parents in the Broomhill district of Glasgow
and worked in the British Linen Bank as a clerk. A former pupil of
Glasgow High School, he was a regular attender at his local church and a
Sunday School teacher.
At the end of August 1952 he disappeared from his work, taking with
him a large quantity of his employer's money. With his ill-gotten gains
he went to Dublin where, unknown to anybody, he bought an automatic gun
and ammunition, pretending to be a soldier on leave. On September 4 he
returned to Glasgow where he tried to contact a female acquaintance.
Failing to speak to her on the telephone, he decided to visit a nearby
tennis club where he believed she might be.
The police were alerted as to his possible whereabouts and two CID
officers were sent to interview him. As they approached the area they
spotted him walking along Hyndland Road.
Unaware as to how dangerous he was, they approached him and revealed
who they were. Finlay produced his gun and immediately shot Constable
John MacLeod dead and seriously wounded his companion who fortunately
recovered after a lengthy stay in hospital.
The sound of the shots attracted the attention of a uniformed officer,
Charles Hill, who chased the fleeing gunman into a lane. There officer
Hill had to take cover as Finlay tried to shoot his way out of the
cul-de-sac he found himself in.
Realising that he was trapped, the gunman fired off almost all his
bullets in an unsuccessful attempt to force the officer to retreat.
Finally, a single shot was heard followed by a chilling silence. When
eventually officer Hill approached, he found that Finlay, realising that
he could never escape, had used his final bullet to kill himself.
There are similarities between Craig and Finlay. Both came from
seemingly good homes, both became greedy and dishonest, and both showed
a total disregard for the life of an innocent police officer. In each
case a young man used a firearm and, within two months, two young wives
were widowed and children orphaned.
A fatal accident inquiry into the deaths of John MacLeod and Edwin
Finlay was held in Glasgow Sheriff Court on October 31. The Herald
covered the proceedings fully and beside the report appear details of a
12-year sentence passed at the Old Bailey on a Niven Craig. It was the
downfall of his older brother which Christopher Craig blamed for his
hatred of the police and which led to the murder of PC Miles.
It is a strange coincidence that the details of the final legal steps
in the Hyndland murder case should appear next to the recording of the
start of events which culminated in Bentley's execution three months
later.
Maybe it was the public outrage following Constable MacLeod's death
which convinced the Home Office that an example had to be made in the
case of Bentley. Sir David must have been aware of the earlier case when
he came to review Bentley's file.
Before, however, too much sympathy is expended on the feeble-minded
Bentley it is worth remembering three points. The jury found that he
chose to go with Craig knowing that the latter had a gun; he chose to
have in his possession a sharp dagger and a vicious knuckle-duster with
a protruding spike and, finally, and most important of all, Constable
Miles was given no choice whether he could live or die; he was shot in
cold blood, as was Constable MacLeod, in both cases doing their duty.
Many felt at the time that if anybody deserved sympathy and
consideration it was their families rather than their killers.
Constable MacLeod's widow was not forgotten by the people of Scotland.
A contribution came from a special football match between the league
champions and the Scottish Cup holders, Hibernian and Motherwell,
attended by more than 10,000 spectators. Hugh Fraser, founder of the
Fraser stores, contributed #500 to the Lord Provost of Glasgow's appeal.
Within a month #5522 had been raised in memory of the quiet father whose
body had been taken back to his native Stornoway for burial.

THE Principal of Stirling University yesterday firmly denied that he
was trying to persuade campaigners for a Highland university to abandon
the idea of an independent university in the meantime, in favour of
Stirling providing degree level courses in the area.
At one point yesterday it had appeared that Professor Andrew Miller
was coming close to that proposition when he addressed a graduation
ceremony in Inverness. This was a joint ceremony with Inverness College
and saw 28 students receive a university degree, the first to do so
having completed courses delivered and developed in the Highlands.
The BSc in applied computing and the BA in business management marked
the end of the first three years of academic association between the
university and the college, and Professor Miller was clearly commending
it as the way ahead.
''As a result of this graduation ceremony, it is now firmly
established that there is a university in the Highlands. This is a
historic occasion when 28 graduates receive their degrees having done
all their studies in the Highlands. Inverness College and the University
of Stirling have demonstrated that there is a mechanism that works.''
When asked when he thought the establishment of an independent
Highland university would be seen, Professor Miller said: ''It could
well be a decade or slightly more.'' But it could well happen before
then, he added.
One of three people to be awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of the
University at yesterday's ceremony was Mrs Valerie MacIver, who chairs
Highland Regional Council's education committee and the steering group
of the University of the Highlands and Islands project.
Mrs MacIver said afterwards she had listened carefully to Professor
Miller's address but had not heard anything inconsistent with the
general aims and objectives of the UHI project.
''But I firmly believe an independent University of the Highlands and
Islands is only six or seven years away,'' she said.

* ADRIAN WARD must be the only Scottish lawyer whose tomes have been
translated into Russian, Czech, and Estonian. Newly back in Barrhead
from the delights of Uzbekistan (not much difference from Renfrewshire,
you might say, except that earthquakes in Tashkent are less seismic), he
was able to surprise the Clark Foundation with a copy of the Russian
edition which it had funded. A New View is his fourth volume on the law
and mental disabilities, a much-neglected area in the former Soviet
Union. He is now revising and expanding the first from 1984, Scots Law
and the Mentally Handicapped. The title, for a start, is no longer
politically correct.
Wigs and wags
* WHEN the Law Page was in its infancy, it featured regular legal
cartoons by TAK, a member of the Faculty of Advocates, who showed that
the law is not the humourless business that some suppose. Now Howgate
Publishing has produced a compilation of his funniest work.
A few samples: one advocate is pictured in his GP's waiting room,
saying: ''It's very worrying, doc. I keep believing my clients.'' A
solicitor writes to a client from his office: ''To writing to wishing
you a Merry Christmas -- five guineas.'' Two advocates, adorned with
wings as well as wigs, are standing on a cloud. One says to the other:
''So I asked the witness, 'Could you demonstrate how he stabbed you?'''
As others see us
* LAURA MacPHEE, seven, chummed her aunty Ros for a day to the Court
of Session. As well as a thoughtful portrait of Lord Penrose, looking
very imposing and slightly cross-eyed, she also produced a report: ''In
the court it was very scary. It was also because it was sort of cold.
The judge wore a red gown and a wig. But he didn't look like Santa. I
can't remember what he said. I didn't understand it. Neither did my
Aunt. I want to be a ciliseter. You get to wear nice suits if you're a
woman.''
If Laura found it that frightening as a visitor what hope is there for
child witnesses, even shielded by video links? On the plus side for her
chosen career, she writes with great clarity. Spells a lot better than
most solicitors, too.
Bastions of the law (No 76)
* MEANWHILE, there's an equally revealing perspective from the other
side of the Bar and age scale.
The second volume of Lord Stott's diaries (''It's a Stotter'', Scots
Law Times: ''Quotidian judicial extrapolations in humorous vein'', The
Sun) published by Mercat Press covers the years 1967 to 1973 when he was
on the bench.
It gives a warm, funny, and sometimes wicked look at life and the law
in the swinging sixties and sinful seventies. Perhaps because of his
slightly unprepossessing appearance, and lack of a plummy accent, many
people underestimated Gordon Stott, a son of the manse and a first-class
honours graduate in classics.
His great qualities are complete confidence in his own judgment and
the fearlessness to speak his mind, as with his run-ins as Lord Advocate
with the late Lord Clyde.
''We did not agree and we were always quarrelling, but I did not
dislike Clyde,'' Stott, now 85, recalls, ''. . . he was a very bad
judge, of course.
''I had to take out one or two little bits in the book which I thought
would cause trouble, but nothing very much. It is virtually as I wrote
it at the time.''
He is no stranger to controversy. His views on rape will not find
favour with women's groups and he is also dismissive of
solicitor-advocates and drug policy, once remarking to The Herald: ''If
you supply alcohol you probably land in the House of Lords. If you
supply heroin you'll end up in Barlinnie.''
Volume one was not a financial success, losing him #1500 in royalties
in the Maxwell publishing crash, but stand by your beds for the next
tome.
''I have been keeping a diary since I was 15. There is plenty of
material for more if this one gets a decent circulation.''

EXCLUSIVE
PLANS have been announced for a #50m office and industrial park which
could create 2000 jobs on a strategic site.
London-based developer Creston Land &amp; Estates yesterday said the
scheme, which is to be located next to Junction 9 on the M8, will be
developed in association with Glasgow District Council.
Planning consent is being sought for about 850,000 sq ft of office,
industrial, and warehouse space. It is understood that the council is
keen to see the scheme go ahead and early approval is anticipated.
To be called Springhill Park, the proposed scheme will take five years
to complete. The site was originally owned by the Stakis Group, whose
own ambitions for a massive business park scheme were shattered by the
property crash and recession.
After helping Stakis sort out its property portfolio, Creston recently
acquired Springhill Park from the hotels group. Around #3m of
infrastructure works have already begun, and the developer is hoping to
be granted direct access to the M8.
The 76-acre site has more than half-a-mile of motorway frontage.
Strathclyde Regional Cuncil is considering the provision of motorway
signs -- a first for a Scottish business park -- from the M73, M74 and
M8.
Springhill Park's strategic location and easy motorway access could
provide tough competition for other proposed schemes at Braehead,
Pacific Quay and Cardonald.
With its financial incentives for relocaters, the Lanarkshire
enterprise zone a few miles further east could prove a harder nut to
crack.
Although marketing of the site has yet to start, Creston said some
potential major pre-lets had already emerged.
Managing director Tom King said: ''We are extremely optimistic about
the prospects for Springhill Park. We own 76 acres and the city council
has some adjoining land on which we have also applied for development
consent.
''The council is convinced of the importance of this site, and we are
working closely together and are hoping to secure a couple of early
occupiers.
''There is a pent-up demand for good quality accommodation -- I
believe this is the time to come out and start building.''
It is understood that serious discussions are under way with two
potential users.
Jeff Semple of letting agent James Barr &amp; Son said Springhill Park
offered Glasgow an opportunity to win back some of the industry which
had located in new towns and the Lanarkshire enterprise zone.
''It's a terribly important site for the city and has been identified
as one of five strategic locations for industrial development, along
with Cardonald, Darnley, Cambuslang, and Robroyston.
''Springhill Park will offer very large-scale development potential to
major occupiers who want to be in Glasgow, on a prominent site, with
easy motorway access.''

THERE was not a great deal of praise being sent in Scotland's
direction yesterday when the Finnish team manager looked towards the
Hampden game between the two countries tonight. The man who still hopes
to guide Finland to the European Championship finals in England next
summer, Jukka Ikalainen, remains unimpressed by Scotland's powerful
position in the qualifying group.
The Scots may sit in second place behind favourites Russia in Group 8,
they may have a two-point lead over Finland and a stunningly superior
goal difference, and yet Ikalainen still managed to damn Craig Brown's
men with faint praise.
''We know all about Scotland,'' he smiled, ''and I don't think Mr
Brown will be able to surprise me in any way. I will wait to see if he
can produce something unexpected, but I doubt if he will be able to do
that.
''Scotland do not impress me technically. They do not have players
with the technique of players in other countries. What they have is
fighting spirit. That is what we think about most when we think about
the Scottish team. Their players will fight for everything, but
sometimes that is not enough.''
Ikalainen seemes to find it difficult to name any Scots who will cause
him concern at Hampden. Almost grudgingly, he eventually listed Colin
Hendry, Gary McAllister, John Collins and Ally McCoist as players who
may bring trouble.
He also shrugged off that staggering 6-0 defeat his team suffered
against Russia in Helsinki last month on the same night that Scotland
beat Greece at Hampden to move into the second qualifying spot in the
section.
''That will not affect us now,'' he said dismissively. ''In any case,
you must remember we were missing important players in that match. It
was a shock for us, but we did not have, for example, Jari Litmanen, and
he is Finland's top player.
''However, he is here for this game and that is very important. He is
the biggest name in our country's football and, while he is not fully
match fit, we did not want to go into this game without him.
''We are happy to run the risk of playing him even though he has not
played for five or six weeks now.
''I don't think Mr Brown will man-mark him as he did when we played
the last time in Helsinki. I think he will try something different here
and we are prepared for that.''
In that last meeting, the opening group game, Scotland won 2-0 and
Litmanen was shadowed by Rangers defender Alan McLaren. The discipline
shown that night by the young Scot was hugely influential on the final
result. With Litmanen subdued Scotland gained their most crucial result
in the games played so far.
However, it is clear the Finns believe they can gain revenge. Says
Ikalainen: ''There is still a chance that we will be in England for the
finals. A big chance. We know what MyPa did against Motherwell in the
UEFA Cup -- and we know that Motherwell were the second team in your
league last season.
''We are not saying our club football is as strong as the Scottish
game, but MyPa did win and that has given us hope. If a club team can
win here then so can the national team.
''What we must avoid is having a bad start. An ideal situation would
be to find the score 0-0 at half-time and then, perhaps, all the
pressure would go on to the Scottish players. That is what we would
like.''
While Brown guards his final team selection until just before kick-off
as usual, Ikalainen underlined his confidence by naming his side after
training yesterday morning.
Only victories over the two teams above them can carry Finland into
the Euro finals. They must beat Scotland tonight and then travel to
Moscow and defeat the mighty Russians. Which is why it is difficult to
see where yesterday's ring of confidence comes form. Or is it all just
another con trick aimed at undermining the Scots? Tonight will tell.
FINLAND -- Laukkanen, Suominen, Kanerva, Holmgren, Nieminen, Myrry,
Litmanen, Lindberg, Rissanen, Jarvinen, Hjelm.

CRAIG Brown said he picked Jim Leighton for tonight's European
championship qualifying tie against Finland because the Hibernian keeper
''is the appropriate'' player for the task. On the face of it, the
national side's manager seemed to be saying Leighton is a better keeper
than Rangers' Andy Goram, but like the rest of us, Brown knows that is
not the case.
Being a diplomat, Brown was unwilling to elaborate on his decision to
play Leighton instead of the keeper widely recognised as Scotland's
No.1, but perhaps the manager should simply have said he was unsure of
Goram's commitment to the cause.
It is not even in the vicinity of the outrageous to believe Goram
would have started against Finland in the penultimate match of
Scotland's qualifying campaign had he stayed with the squad which had
assembled for the match against Greece last month.
However, he said then his mind was not focused on his job and promptly
withdrew, leaving the country's supporters wondering exactly what was on
the keeper's mind.
Brown appeared to accept Goram's head was in a fragile state and he
was happy to welcome him back for this tie against Finland. All it took,
apparently, was a few words of chat, during which Goram said his mind
was clear again, but it would have been a disgraceful decision had the
manager decided to drop Leighton, who performed well against the Greeks.
At the time Goram was unable to state clearly why he felt he could not
play for Scotland, yet he remained in a healthy state of readiness for
Rangers in their European Cup preliminary tie against Anorthosis
Famagusta.
You may remember that initially the keeper made it clear he was
anxious about running the risk of injury while playing for Scotland, the
same risk every player who wants to wear the national jersey must run.
He may well have been in a state of confusion at the time, but it would
have been wrong of Brown had he dropped the more willing Leighton this
time around.
Goram had to understand he could not simply return when he felt like
it and it could be he has been left in no doubt he must do some kind of
penance on the substitutes' bench, which would be a fair compromise,
given that Scotland will need him.
Defeat of the Finns would ensure Scotland's place in the finals of the
European Championships in England next summer, when Brown will require
all of his best players, and even though Leighton says he intends
challenging for the keeper's jersey for the 1998 World Cup finals in
France, by which time he will be nudging 40, the fact is the country
will look to Goram.
Still, Brown should have said yesterday that he felt he owed Leighton
the jersey for this game because of his loyalty, a quality which is
seeping out of all professions and not just football. The manager might
also have made it clear no one player can pick and choose when he wants
to play, especially when his captain, Gary McAllister, was busy
extolling the virtues of team spirit.
''We've created the kind of spirit you would normally expect to find
in a club side,'' the Leeds United midfield player said when asked to
explain why a largely mediocre squad had manoeuvred itself to the point
of qualification. ''Also, this is a team which doesn't rely on any one
player, and when the manager names his sides there is no jealousy among
those left out. Nobody goes away sulking. No-one is bigger than the
country.''
McAllister again will be charged with the responsibility of
orchestrating Scotland's play against Finland, who will be more
dangerous than ever because they realise defeat would end their own
quest. The Scots, of course, could take a draw and still go through by
beating San Marino at Hampden in November.
It is possible McAllister could be joined in the midfield zone by
Rangers central defender Alan McLaren, who will probably be given the
role of marking Finland's one class act, Jari Litmanen, just as he did
when Scotland opened their Group 8 schedule with a vital 2-0 win in
Helsinki a year ago.
McLaren did not allow Litmanen any room to operate and Brown is
seriously considering employing the same tactic this time. But if the
Finn drops deep and becomes anonymous, as he did last time, the marker
could simply back up the midfield.
''We have options,'' Brown said while discussing the threat of the
Ajax player. ''We could cut off his supply, close down his space, or
mark him.''
If McLaren is deployed to subdue Litmanen it would mean a continuation
of international service for Celtic's Tosh McKinlay, who was a late
arrival at the camp for the Greece match yet one of the best players on
the night. In front of Leighton the manager might go for a defensive
line of Colin Hendry, Colin Calderwood, and Tom Boyd, with McKinlay on
the left of midfield and Stewart McKimmie on the opposite flank.
Between these two could be McAllister, McLaren and John Collins, with
Ally McCoist and Scott Booth up front. Brown said Aberdeen's Duncan
Shearer is a doubtful starter, which means he won't have a robust type
of player in the front line, but he is confident the more mobile
performers should be able to cause problems.
Besides, the bottom line is that Scotland are playing against a side
which conceded six goals to Russia in their last match and a victory
should be within the reach of Brown's players. Three points would allow
the manager the luxury of refining and experimenting with the team
against San Marino in preparation for the real thing, and three points
are what the supporters are entitled to expect.
There are only a handful of tickets left for the game and they can be
bought today at Hampden or the SFA's Park Gardens' headquarters.

THE plan by millionaire businessman John Connor to create Scotland's
first super club is still alive and kicking with Watsonians now the
front-runners, and it emerged yesterday that they had tried
unsuccessfully to attract All Black World Cup star Jonah Lomu to
Myreside.
Part of Connor's plan is to entice big-name Southern Hemisphere
players to his super club, a tactic which he is convinced would set the
turnstiles clicking and enhance the club's finances.
He said yesterday that Lomu, who has since signed a lucrative deal
with the New Zealand RFU, had been approached by former Scotland captain
Gavin Hastings, who has been closely involved in the Myreside
negotiations.
Connor, who recently sold his Gartcosh-based Stirling Fibre wastepaper
recycling business for several million pounds, said his timetable had
been disrupted by the arrival of the Kerry Packer's World Rugby
Corporation, and the pool had been further muddied by last weekend's IB
decision to scrap the amateurism regulations.
He is having further talks with club officials at Myreside on Saturday
after the premiership game against Stirling County and he revealed he
has now set a deadline for the completion of talks.
When the scheme for a consortium of businessmen headed by Connor to
inject up to #200,000 in a Scottish club was first mooted, the main aim
was said to be an effort to prevent Scottish players moving south to
wealthy English clubs.
Connor has been talking to Watsonians -- and to Boroughmuir -- but
over the past few weeks the Meggetland side, despite its connections
with Connor confidante, ex-Scotland prop Norrie Rowan, has slipped into
second place.
One of the main conditions which Connor has set before he places cash
with a club is the creation of a separate commercial arm in the form of
a limited company which would be responsible for handling all club
business.
Yesterday Connor revealed that Watsonians had already done this. ''The
marketing company was set up to attract top players to the club. The
fact that we approached All Black captain Sean Fitzpatrick is now well
enough known, but through Gavin we also approached Jonah Lomu.
''Once Packer came upon the scene, and with the IB announcement last
weekend, the whole situation became so unclear that problems arose. We
targeted Fitzpatrick, and Lomu was considered and approached by Gavin,
but we are now not sure what their contracts with the New Zealand union
permits them to do. The whole thing will probably have to be
revisited,'' he said.
''Norrie is now approaching South African players through the former
Scotland hooker John Allan but at the moment the situation is unclear.
''If we could have attracted Rob Wainwright and Derrick Patterson back
to Scotland from West Hartlepool then that would have done for starters.
Watsonians know that the money is there and they know what has to be
done for it to be released. I'm not prepared to saw exactly what the
criteria are or when the deadline expires, but I can assure you that the
plan is certainly not dead.''
Watsonians president Ian Monteath declared: ''We are still speaking to
Mr Connor. He has been on holiday but we hope to see him on Saturday. We
are not having any differences of opinion. It is a complicated process
and it is taking time to put together.''

ONE of the West End's most interesting villas has just come onto the
market. Built in 1904 and designed by the architect A.N. Prentice,
number 15 Cleveden Gardens in leafy Kelvinside has impressive arched
windows on the ground floor, a cupola on the roof and charming little
balconies -- the sort you expect to find in the stage set for an opera
-- on the first-floor windows. And that musical connection may well have
helped persuade Sir Alexander Gibson, the first native-born, principal
conductor and artistic director of the Scottish National Orchestra and
champion of Scottish Opera, to buy this prestigious residence. The wide
hall has a wooden floor, a vaulted ceiling, sandstone fireplace, and a
carved wooden balustrade on the stairs. From the hall there is direct
access to the drawing room which contains the original ceiling cornice,
the sitting room, and the dining room which has a large oriel window
looking out onto the rear of the property. A wing on the ground floor
houses the kitchen and laundry. Upstairs there are five bedrooms and a
living room. Clyde Property is seeking offers over #375,000 for the
house.

SCOTLAND UNDER-21s:
THERE may be more important matters to be dealt with today on the
international front but Tommy Craig and his Under-21 side will not be
easily persuaded that their own little European Championship exercise
this afternoon at Broadwood Park, Cumbernauld, can be treated lightly.
The young players are within sight of the quarter-finals of the
tournament and, if they beat Finland, will be just about over the
finishing line.
The meeting between them and the Finns is as close to a decider as you
can get.
Scotland's excellent record of five wins and a defeat in six games is
actually inferior to that of the Finns, who have five wins and a draw to
their credit. With one game each to come after this afternoon's clash,
the chances are that the team which succeeds today will go through to
later stages.
For the Finns there is the added incentive of a place in the Olympic
Games if they get through, and they will be trying very hard indeed to
repeat their victory over Scotland in the first game of this series.
Craig is treating it all so seriously that he again decided to
withhold his team selection yesterday, preferring to sit on his choice
until just before the game.
'''The game has more or less become a cup-tie,'' he said. ''Both teams
know victory can put qualification within touching distance and at the
same time rule the losers out.
''I expect it to be a really tight match but it is one the boys are
looking forward to immensely.''
The coach pointed out that the Under-21s, while deserving the praise
that has been heaped on them, will have to be on their very best form to
beat the Finnish lads.
He added: ''They are a very good side and we will have to play well to
win. But our boys showed with their performance against Greece that they
are a force to be reckoned with and I'm looking for a repeat of that.''
Two players already certain to play are central defenders Peter
Handyside, of Grimsby Town, and Christian Dailly, of Dundee United. But
also down on the list as starters are Aberdeen keeper Derek Stillie and
Barnsley midfield man Andy Liddell.
The boy from England, who will be earning his eighth cap at this
level, has demonstrated unequivocally that he has no doubts at all about
his loyalties. Although he was born in Leeds, where his dad, former
Hearts player Gary Liddell, ended his career, Andy has been well
schooled in his antecedents.
''From an early age I can remember my dad screaming for Scotland to
beat England when the game was on the telly,'' said Andy, in his best
Yorkshire accent, ''and I turned down the chance to play for England
Youths because I wanted to play for Scotland. It has paid off with my
Under-21 caps.''
Liddell scored against the Greeks at Rugby Park but on his own
admission should have had a hat trick. ''In fact, I did well managing
not to score one certainty.''
He admits that he takes a bit of ribbing from the Scots about his
accent -- ''they say they can't understand a word I'm saying'' -- but
suffers the other way around when he goes back to Barnsley where he is
known as a ''sweaty sock''.
''I hope to have the last laugh on them,'' he said, ''because our
keeper, Dave Watson, plays for the English Under-21s, who lost in
Portugal and now look as if they may not make it to the quarter-finals.
If we get through, I'll have a good time.''
Charlie Miller, the Rangers player who has been so impressive this
season, missed training yesterday but Craig said: ''With an extra 24
hours to prepare this time, the training was optional.''
* MANAGER Roy Aitken admitted yesterday that he is closer to clinching
the transfer targets needed to strengthen Aberdeen.
The Pittodrie club has been linked with Republic of Ireland midfielder
John Sheridan, Dundee United's Billy McKinlay, and Oldham's Paul
Bernard, but Aitken said: ''I refuse to become involved in speculation
about possible signings.
''Money will be made available from our share launch and I am
currently drawing up a list of players who might suit our purposes.''
The move to go public is expected to raise #3.5m, most of which will
go to Aitken for rebuilding his team.
* AIRDRIE goalkeeper John Martin and Dumbarton's new manager Jim
Fallon will take a special interest in the display of the Scotland squad
in the Four Nations Youth Tournament later this month.
The young Scots will meet Holland, Denmark, and Belgium in the
under-17 competition at Stirling, and youth coach Ross Mathie yesterday
included Hibernian striker John Martin -- son of the Airdrie keeper --
and Dundee United's Steve Fallon -- son of the Dumbarton manager -- in
his 16-strong squad.
Also in for the first time are Bolton defender Jim McLeod, originally
from Stranraer, Aberdeen midfielder Darren Young, and the Oldham forward
Alan Clark, who was recommended by former Scotland cap Willie Donnachie.
Squad:
Cooke (Rangers), Mitchell (St Mirren), McCaffrey (Hibernian), Borland
(Celtic), Fallon (Dundee United), Watt (Rangers), McLeod (Bolton),
Easton (Dundee United), David Young (Rangers), Galloway (St Mirren),
Darren Young (Aberdeen), McBride (Celtic), Graham (Rangers), Queen
(Hearts), Martin (Hibernian), Clark (Oldham).

Belgium v Denmark
RANGERS striker Brian Laudrup has pledged to help Denmark overcome an
attack-minded Belgium in their vital European Championship qualifier in
Brussels tonight. Laudrup has been out of action for three weeks because
of the ankle injury which kept him out of Denmark's previous qualifier
against Armenia last month, but he said: ''I've played before for the
national team after having been sidelined for five or six weeks, so it's
no big deal. I'm ready.''
Denmark's 2-0 victory against Armenia hoisted them to second place in
Group 2, three points ahead of Belgium but five behind runaway leaders
Spain. Two teams qualify from the section and Belgium, beaten 3-1 in
Copenhagen last year, must beat the title-holders this time to stay in
the race for a berth at next year's finals.
Laudrup, however, has promised the Belgians a tough time and said:
''It's the perfect match for me. The Belgians must attack, because they
have to win. We're satisfied with a draw and can counter-attack -- and
that's when I'm at my best.''
Denmark are also likely to include Manchester United keeper Peter
Schmeichel and West Ham's Marc Rieper in their side. Sheffield Wednesday
striker Marc Degryse is match fit again after missing last month's
friendly against Germany.
* THE Channel Tunnel provides an easy route to England for the French,
but their national football team are finding it tough qualifying for
next year's European Championships and making the trip. Memories of
their failure to qualify for the 1994 World Cup are still fresh as they
go into their last three championship games in Group 1 needing to win
them all.
With Romania virtually sure of qualifying, the French go into
tonight's game in Auxerre against Azerbaijan knowing that anything less
than a victory could cost them second place. A trip to Romania is
followed by a home match against Israel.
In their last game, a 1-1 draw at home to Poland, the French
squandered many scoring goal chances, yet coach Aime Jacquet, unable to
call on suspended Eric Cantona and injured Jean-Pierre Papin, has
relegated his team's most talented forward, David Ginola, to the bench
for tonight's match.

AUSTRIA v REP. OF IRELAND
MARK Kennedy is undaunted about making his Republic of Ireland debut
in tonight's crucial European Championship qualifier in Vienna.
The 19-year-old former Millwall winger, who cost Liverpool #2m last
March, will make his international bow in a match that could make or
break the Republic's chances of reaching Euro '96.
Kennedy was just 16 when he made his debut for the London club, and
has played in front of big crowds before.
Manager Jack Charlton gives Kennedy his chance in place of Aston
Villa's injured Steve Staunton, wide on the left of a five-man midfield
and with orders to launch some telling runs and crosses for the head of
giant striker Niall Quinn, a lone figure in attack.
Blunt-speaking Charlton, who called Kennedy from the Republic's
Under-21 camp on Monday night after the withdrawal of Bolton's Jason
McAteer, said: ''Mark will either play crap -- like I've seen him in a
few games -- or he'll do well, as in other matches I've also seen. You
can never be sure how younger players will perform.''
Manchester United's Roy Keane and skipper Andy Townsend of Aston Villa
are back after having missed the 3-1 defeat by Austria in June and the
dismal draw with Liechtenstein a week earlier. Last month's shock
Austrian defeat in Latvia opened the door for the Irish to qualify
behind Group 6 leaders Portugal.
Austria will miss the injured Andreas Ogris, who scored at Lansdowne
Road, but playmaker Andreas Herzog returns. The main danger is again
likely to be 31-year-old striker Toni Polster, who scored two cracking
goals in Dublin.
Meanwhile manager Maurice Setters saw his side lose 1-0 to 10-man
Austria in an Under-21 qualifier in Amstetten yesterday.
Tiny Jurgen Kauz headed home from a corner after nine minutes, but
Austrian defender Gunter Schiesswald was sent off for a professional
foul on Tottenham's Andy Turner with 26 minutes to go. However, keeper
Mario Krassnitzer broke Irish hearts with a string of brilliant saves.
* BOBBY Gould prepared for his baptism as an international manager by
issuing a rallying cry to his Wales side to show they have the passion
and skill to become a force again after a year without a win.
They take on Moldova in Cardiff, and Gould has made four changes from
the side beaten by Georgia last June. He believes today will represent
the first step back.

TRANSFER NEWS
MAURICE Johnston reckons old Rangers buddy Derek Ferguson can help to
fire Falkirk to success.
In fact, Johnston hassled manager John Lambie into making a #300,000
swoop to land the 28-year-old midfielder from Sunderland, and is
delighted at the chance to link with Ferguson once again.
Johnston said: ''I played alongside him for a couple of years and he's
one of the best midfield players in Scotland. There's no doubt Derek
will add a bit of class to the side, and I can't wait to see him in
action again.''
The deal is the biggest in Lambie's lengthy managerial career. He
joked: ''Mo nipped my head to go out and buy Derek, telling me what a
great player he was at Rangers. If it doesn't work out, I'll have to put
my head in the oven -- and he can join me.
''But I'm sure it will, and I have to thank the chairman, George
Fulston, for the drive and ambition he has shown. That's the way to take
Falkirk forward and it made a nice change for myself after all the
wheeling and dealing I've done in the transfer market.''
Ferguson, who has signed a two-year deal at Brockville, said:
''Falkirk gave me the opportunity to come back to Scotland and get back
into playing first-team football. I enjoyed my time at Sunderland, but
it became clear I wasn't featuring in Peter Reid's plans.''
He is poised to make his debut at Tynecastle on Saturday against old
club Hearts, whom he joined Hearts from Ibrox in 1990. Three years later
Terry Butcher paid out #650,000 to take him to Sunderland.

AFTER 19 years at Powderhall, Edinburgh Monarchs have had their
request to continue racing there in 1996 refused.
They had hoped the stadium owners would allow another season before
beginning developments currently being considered by planning
authorities.
But now the search is on for an alternative venue for the new season
next April, and negotiations have begun with the authorities at
Ingliston on the west side of Edinburgh.
Monarchs' chairman Alex Harkness said: ''We've been told that the
owners could reconsider if there's a delay in the planning permission,
but we can't rely on that.''

SIMON Stainrod last night bowed to fan pressure and quit as manager of
Ayr United.
But the high-profile Stainrod immediately stated: ''Doing that may
seem as if I am a failure, but I don't feel that.''
''I believe that the club now has a chance. When I went there 18
months ago it had no infra-structure. It had no youth team, no under-16
team, but now it has.''
His decision to leave comes after the side were relegated last season
to the second division and have started this campaign badly. During
Saturday's 4-1 home defeat from Berwick the home support actually
cheered on the visitors and booed the Ayr players.
But Stainrod criticised that attitude from the fans. ''I know that the
past two results in particular have been bad, and I know that the fans
pay their money and why they did that.
''But there is so much happens at a club that supporters do not see.
There is so much work going on behind the scenes to put it on the
correct lines, but at the end of the day all the fans are interested in
is the result of the first team.
''We did not have the money and had to sign free-transfer plaeyrs. If
you sign 20 of them, then you are not going to find that five are
world-beaters.
''In fact, you will be lucky to get two that are outstanding and we
did that -- for we got John Sharples and Frank Rolling, who is now on
trial at Leicester.
''I am not used to the stick I got, but I could handle that. But I had
an amicable chat with the chairman, Bill Barr, who is a first-class
individual, and decided that because of all the reasons I have gone
into, it was better that I leave.
''I also found it difficult that we had switched to part-time
football. I enjoy coaching more than anything, and believe that the only
way for players to get better is by coaching and education.''

'More people watch junior football than rugby. That's where the sport
is just now.'
DAVID Murray, the man whose vision has transformed Scottish club
football into an arena that can attract some of the world's best names,
believes professionalism could have a disastrous effect on the game of
rugby in Scotland.
''I think that it's in danger of ruining the game,'' says Murray,
himself a former rugby player with Dalkieth. ''What people have to
remember is that rugby has been hijacked onto the world stage by Rupert
Murdoch, who wants to televise New Zealand, Australia and South Africa.
Scotland is way down the pecking order.
''You have to accept that in Scotland, even on an international day,
there are only 20,000 or so rugby fans in Murrayfield watching the game
out of the 60,000 in the ground. The rest are the Barbour and
shooting-stick brigade, and on any other Saturday in the season there
will be more people watching junior football than rugby. That's where
the sport is just now.''
And that's where I wish I had a good grasp of Scottish sporting
statistics, but I don't.
It is the almost unseemly clamour for money from players that appears
to make Murray shrug his shoulders with disbelief and disappointment.
You sense he thinks that some of them do not really understand the
market they find themselves in.
''Some of my greatest friends are from my rugby days,'' says Murray.
''Take Ken Cockburn, who runs my metal side. I met him when he played
for Lassswade and I played for Dalkieth. We used to talk over a pint.
It's that kind of spirit that will go from rugby if the game is not
careful.''
I have to say I was surprised at what Murray had to say. I thought
that, being the consummately aggressive businessman -- and Gavin
Hastings' employer to boot -- he would have welcomed professionalism not
only as the logical way ahead for the game, but as a potential
investment opportunity for the more ambitious businessmen and, at last,
a chance for the players to earn what they are due.
Instead, he draws parallels with football, first explaining what he
has done to change the Rangers image for their fans, then comparing the
money side of the game in Scotland with the English game.
''What was the gate at the last Celtic home game when they won the
championship nine times in a row?'' he asked. Haven't a clue, I said.
''Celtic played Morton and they got a crowd of 8000. That's all, 8000
people, because nothing had changed,'' he said.
''We have never forgotten that. We are in the entertainment business.
If we give people a Laudrup one year, then we give them a Gascoigne the
next, and keep the menu changing or else people get bored. We will be
spending #12m on the stadium, and we want women and families interested
in Ibrox.
''But as far as rugby is concerned, you can look at English football
for an idea of what will happen. The English FA have just signed a deal
worth #100m a year, whereas we in Scotland have signed one worth #15m
over five years. That's the difference, and it always will be.
''What rugby will find is that the richer clubs or countries, your
Manchester Uniteds and Liverpools if you like, will get richer, while
the poor stay poor. We in Scotland just don't have the population to
sustain a big professional rugby game.''
Yet he does believe that businessmen will be attracted into the game,
as a purely commercial decision applies as to whether to spend the money
required for advertising boards or sponsorship logos on TV through
rugby. But the players, he believes, have taken the wrong end of the
stick.
''The talk about big money earnings for players in Scotland is
absolute rubbish,'' he says. ''Take Gavin Hastings. Even he has a
limited shelf life now.
''The claims made by some people, who think that they can earn a huge
amount of money for players, are similarly wrong. My son, David, is
friendly with some of the rugby players, Paul Jennings at Boroughmuir
and Craig Joiner, for example, and they are talking about the money that
might come into the game and wondering what to do. But I would certainly
recommend that rugby players do not give up their jobs. I would say, sit
tight. Don't forget what rugby is all about.
''The game is well administered by the SRU and they showed tremendous
realism saying what they did, but don't lets get carried away with
this.''
All of which came like a bit of a bolt from the blue. I thought he
would say that he was going to get into rugby, employ half the rugby
team, back Gavin Hastings as an agent, and buy a rugby club. So will he
get involved and do for someone in rugby what he has achieved in
football?
''Listen,'' he says. ''I employ 2700 people and I've got enough on my
plate. I need rugby like I need a hole in the head.''
That's the kind of quote I like. I take it, then, that he will be
investing. And if he did, I'd be in favour of that.

THE former Scotland and British Lions coach Ian McGeechan yesterday
dismissed as ''media conjecture'' the suggestion that he might become
the Welsh national coach.
McGeechan, who earlier this week tied up an agreement to bring Gala's
Gregor Townsend to Northampton, where he is in the second year of a paid
post as the English second division club's paid director of rugby, said:
''Nobody has been in touch with me. This just seems to have been
speculation coming out of South Africa, where Wales are on tour.
''I've had quite a lot of approaches for fairly high-profile jobs in
the past year or so, but I'm quite happy here at Northampton. This Welsh
thing is just conjecture and they have not been in touch with me.''
Wales dismissed coach Alan Davies last April and have operated with
caretaker coach Alex Evans in charge since then. The WRFU, apparently,
wishes to tailor the job for a full professional along the lines of that
which now exists in Scotland with director of rugby and national
coaching director Jim Telfer.
However, given the history of bitter in-fighting which has disfigured
Welsh rugby in recent years it would be a brave man who would take on
the high pressure job of coaching the national side.
* STEWART'S Melville FP, who opened their Premiership Division II
challenge with a win over Dundee HS FP on Saturday, have signed a
one-year sponsorship contract with Save and Prosper. The deal, which is
for an unspecified amount, links the Edinburgh club with one of the big
names in rugby sposorship, as the firm are backers of Twickenham
internationals and the Middlesex Sevens.
Team manager Alistair Napier said yesterday: ''The agreement is
initially for one year, but there is an option to continue, depending on
the performance of the team and our ability to regain a place in the top
division.''
* BATH want another double, champions Leicester are seeking more
tries, and Wasps' aim is more wins. The Courage League season swings
into action this weekend and England's three premier clubs will once
again be focussing on first place.
They are the only three clubs ever to have held the Courage Trophy and
it may once again be a case of the rest being nowhere. Avoiding one of
the two relegation slots, which threatened half the league last season
before Northampton were the unlucky losers, will be the prime objective
of the other seven sides.
The campaign begins with newly-promoted Saracens facing the daunting
trip to Leicester, Bath are at West Hartlepool, and Wasps welcome
Bristol.

ALLAN Campbell, the Scottish Badminton Union's director of coaching
and development, is leaving to take up a similar post with the Scottish
Sports Council.
In the job since 1983, except for a break of three years he spent
working in Australia, Campbell could prove difficult to replace.
''Really, we require two people, but unfortunately we just don't have
the funds,'' said Anne Smillie, chief executive of the union.
Campbell spent most of his time away from the action doing
administrative and development tasks, while Tom Courtney did the
hands-on work as unpaid coach to Scotland's national squad.
Meanwhile, play continues, with Elinor Allen, Jillian Haldane, Russell
Hogg and Kenny Middlemiss named in a Scotland squad to attend the
Wimbledon Open from September 8 to 10.

THE World Boxing Council said yesterday it had suspended former
heavyweight champion Oliver McCall for refusing to take an anti-doping
test after his title fight with Briton Frank Bruno on Saturday.
''The US boxer Oliver McCall refused to submit to obligatory
anti-doping tests after his defeat last Saturday to Frank Bruno at
Wembley,'' the WBC said in a statement released from its headquarters in
Mexico City.
''This is a serious lack of discipline and we are investigating the
matter. Meanwhile, Oliver McCall is provisionally suspended from the
WBC,'' the council said.
It added that the British Boxing Board of Council was also looking
into the incident.
McCall lost a unanimous 12-round decision to Bruno in front of a
delirious crowd at Wembley. It was the 33-year-old Bruno's first
championship after three unsuccessful attempts.
McCall, who was at one time a sparring partner for the former
undisputed world champion Mike Tyson, initially won the title from
Briton Lennox Lewis last October.
* STEVE Wilson's bid for the British super middleweight championship
has taken a new twist.
The 24-year-old Wallyford prospect was scheduled to challenge
defending champion, Sammy Storey of Belfast, in London next month. But
the Irishman confirmed yesterday that he had agreed terms to meet Henry
Wharton in York on November 1 for the European crown.

ST PAUL was converted on the road to Damascus, but Paul and Richard
Winocour have carried out their own conversion on the road to Ranfurly.
The brothers are partners in Noah Properties, a small company which
converts historic properties into modern housing.
Their latest project is at Ranfurly Church, Bridge of Weir, which has
been converted into nine imaginative homes which make good use of the
church's height.
''We have retained the graceful lines of the church while much of the
sanctuary's powerful interior and many of the original features have
been highlighted,'' says Paul Winocour.
The layout of the six townhouses and apartments within the main church
building has been designed to allow the original porch and the squared
apse area, with its vaulted timber ceiling and traceried leaded glass
windows, to become the main entrance hall.
A flood of interest followed the launch of Noah's development in the
Grade B-Listed kirk and only one property remains for sale -- a south
facing, three-level townhouse apartment at a fixed price of #109,500.
The Winocour brothers have created a double-height living area and
used natural wood finishes wherever possible -- beechwood flooring, ash
doors, pine stairs and maple kitchens. The combination of white walls
and the warmth of natural wood produces a contemporary feel within a
Victorian building.
Their last conversion, at Woodland Church on Glasgow's south side,
received the Glasgow Institute of Architects 1994 Award for Residential
Refurbishment.
Noah's specialised approach results in the company tackling only one
or two select projects each year.

BUYING a holiday house is expensive. But if you can get a return on
your investment through letting it out, the project becomes much more
viable. The newly-launched Brunston Castle holiday resort aims to supply
affordable holiday homes with the backing of a major holiday firm to
achieve lettings.
Developed by Livingston Homes UK, a Dutch firm with a track record in
similar schemes in the Netherlands, the Brunston Castle resort is
located in the valley of Girvan water in south Ayrshire. When complete
the resort will consist of 150 holiday cottages built to a European
design.
To maximise the sunlight, all of the properties face in a southerly
direction and have views of the surrounding golf course and wooded
hills.
Prospective buyers can choose between three different designs of
cottage.
The Bargany Cottage comprises: living room with verandah, an open-plan
kitchen with fitted appliances, two bedrooms and bathroom.
The Brunston Cottage is a ''T' shape cottage with a large living area
and verandah, fitted kitchen with fitted appliances, three bedrooms and
bathroom with dressing tables and an additional toilet.
The Turnberry Cottage is the largest of the cottages and is built on
two levels. The lower level has two bedrooms and a shower room. The
upstairs has a large living area, two additional bedrooms, bathroom and
fully-fitted kitchen Prices at Brunston Castle start from #45,000.
To assist purchasing with letting out their property for holiday lets,
Hoseasons has been retained to act as the letting managers for the
scheme. The firm distributes more than 1.5 million holiday brochures
every year, which are displayed in 6000 travel agents up an down the
country.
The development has views over Brunston Castle Golf Club. The course,
designed and laid out by Scottish architect MacLennan Arkley Steele, is
literally on the doorstep.
The golf courses at Turnberry, Ayr, Prestwick and Troon are all within
easy reach. There are also plans for an activity centre at the resort.
The proposals include an indoor swimming pool, gymnasium and a
recreational centre, shop, and a local pub.
Slater Hogg &amp; Howison has been retained as selling agents for the
Brunston Castle Holiday Resort. The development will be marketed through
the Ayr branch, but details can also be received from the company's
other 32 branches throughout Scotland.
Managing director of Slater Hogg &amp; Howison, Colvil Johnston, said:
''This is the first time Slater Hogg have been involved in a development
of this kind. We are confident that clients looking for a quality
holiday home will be as excited by this original concept as much as we
are.''

TENNIS: US OPEN
BYRON Black, the 25-year old farmer's son from Zimbabwe, caused a
major upset yesterday in the US Open by beating eighth-seeded Michael
Stich in the fourth round of the men's singles.
''I knew he'd get a bit tight in the fifth set,'' said an unflustered
Black, who had to survive a two-set Stich comeback before winning 6-4,
6-4, 3-6, 2-6, 6-3.
Black comes from a tennis background. His father, Don, played once at
Wimbledon and built four grass courts on the farm where Black played
barefoot as a child.
''I was three the first time I picked up a racket,'' said Black, whose
father forbade wearing shoes lest they damage the courts.
Michael Chang beat young Australian interloper Michael Tebbutt 6-2,
6-2, 4-6, 6-3 to move into the quarter-finals, and he was followed by
Jim Courier, who ousted Thomas Muster 6-3, 6-0, 7-6 (7-4).
In the women's singles, Gabriela Sabatini swept into the semi-finals
at Flushing Meadow and then proclaimed herself ready to win the title.
''There is nothing I can say about my game that is wrong,'' said the
1990 champion after routing Mary Joe Fernandez 6-1, 6-3 for her fifth
win without the loss of a set.
''When you feel good, technically, physically and mentally, that is
the key and that is how I feel today,'' said Sabatini.
In the women's doubles quarter-finals, No.8 seeds Brenda
Schultz-McCarthy (Netherlands) and Rennae Stubbs (Australia) put out the
top seeds, Czech Jana Novotna and Arantxa Sanchez Vicario of Spain, 6-7
(4-7), 6-4, 7-6 (7-3).
In the boys' singles, Britain's Martin Lee and James Trotman both won
through to the second round. Lee beat Djordje Matijasevic of Yugoslavia
6-3, 4-6, 7-5, while Trotman beat Bhee Witoontanich of Thailand 6-2,
7-6.
* SCOTLAND'S Alan Mackin helped Britain to a historic first victory in
the World 14-and-under Team championships in Tokyo. He teamed up with
Simon Dickson and Nick Hilton to beat Croatia 2-1, Australia 3-0, and
Germany 3-0 in the final.

SCOTLAND'S preparations for the World Squash Championship have been
left in disarray following the cancellation of this weekend's team trial
at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh.
With Stuart Cowie ruled out by an ankle injury and Barry Sutherland
and Dave Gordon both unavailable, there was little point in going ahead
with the three-day event.
'It is very disappointing,'' admitted team manager, Pat Nicol. ''At
the European championships we had six matches in three days, and some of
our players just couldn't cope. But you can't drag them along to squad
sessions.''
The trial will now be held at the end of this month, after which Nicol
will select the side for the World championships in Egypt from November
13 to 18. Peter Nicol, Pat's son and the world No.4, is the only
definite starter.

ENGLAND'S newest fast bowling hope is already lined up for his first
test, and if he fails it, Ray Illingworth and Co will head straight back
to the drawing board.
Richard Johnson, the 20-year-old Middlesex paceman who took all 10
wickets in a championship innings last season after twice dismissing
Brian Lara cheaply, has emerged from a pack of hopefuls to win a place
on this winter's tour of South Africa. But the very suggestion that he
might figure in the side led by Mike Atherton seems to have been enough
to attract the England injury jinx.
Johnson, whose name was mentioned before this summer's final Test
against West Indies, has been out of action since August 21 with a lower
back problem and may not play again this season. ''I'm having treatment
and I only hope it's okay,'' said Johnson.
Illingworth said: ''We've chosen Richard because he hits the deck hard
with the ball and we feel South Africa's pitches will suit him.''
Despite his injury problems, Johnson -- whose experience is limited to
27 first-class matches -- has taken 40 wickets at 20 runs apiece this
summer.
Johnson's joy was shared in the Middlesex dressing room by Mark
Ramprakash, picked again on the strength of his enormous, though as yet
unfulfilled, potential.
Meanwhile, the selectors have given Andrew Symonds 48 hours to decide
whether he is English or Australian. The 20-year-old Birmingham-born,
Queensland-raised batsman was put on the spot yesterday when England
picked him for the winter A tour of Pakistan.
Symonds told Gloucestershire colleagues yesterday that he didn't know
what he was going to do. ''If I decide my future lies with England it
will mean leaving my family, my girlfriend and my friends in Australia.
But I have got to decide where best I can earn my living as a
professional cricketer.''

Mortgage safety net slips away
TIME is ticking away for those who want to avoid the full impact of
impending changes in income support for borrowers who lose their jobs.
From October 1 new borrowers who later become unemployed will have to
wait nine months before the Department of Social Security helps with
their mortgage payments. Anyone who takes out a new mortgage, or who
re-mortgages with another lender after the end of this month will be
affected.
Existing borrowers will not escape unscathed from social security
secretary Peter Lilley's new rules. Currently they may qualify for 50%
of the interest for the first four months of unemployment, with full
interest being paid after that. From October they will have to pay their
own mortgage for the first two months of unemployment, the DSS will then
pay 50% of their mortgage for the next four months, and their full
mortgage from then on.
Mr Lilley has introduced two further twists of the screw. From next
month there will be a #100,000 mortgage cap, and mortgage interest
relief will be paid at the average interest rate -- anyone whose loan is
at a higher interest rate than the average will have to find the
difference themselves.
It is thought that the changes could save the DSS some #200m per year.
As part of the Government's drive to make us all take more
responsibility for our own lives, Peter Lilley says that it is up to
borrowers to take out their own private mortgage protection insurance to
cover them against redundancy. But a spokeswoman for the Association of
British Insurers said that the insurance industry is waiting to assess
the impact of the changes before deciding whether to introduce new
insurance products.
She also conceded that the industry was looking for ways of minimising
risk by refusing to insure people whose jobs are not secure: ''Most
insurers will refuse to insure people who are on short-term contracts or
who are self-employed.''
The major lenders lobbied hard against the removal of the social
security safety net, pointing out that a fragile housing market was not
equipped to cope with any increased costs in home ownership. A spokesman
for the TSB said: ''We are against these changes. The Government thought
that there would be a flood of new insurance products which would fill
the gap, but that has not yet happened. The market still lacks
confidence and this moves adds to the general feeling of unease.''
Both the Council of Mortgage Lenders and Shelter, the housing charity,
are predicting that changes will increase mortgage arrears and
repossessions.
Adrian Coles of the Council of Mortgage Lenders said that his members
remain opposed to the changes, especially given the tight timescale.
''Private insurance will play a part in meeting borrowers' needs, at a
price. These changes serve to emphasise the general movement to a more
risk-based environment for both borrowers and lenders, especially in the
light of the less secure job prospects for many people.''
The Skipton Building Society gained a lot of publicity earlier this
year when it announced that it would provide its 50,000 borrowers with
free mortgage protection insurance. The estimated cost to the society is
between #2m and #3m. Other lenders, such as the Halifax with some 2.5
million borrowers, have declined to follow the Skipton's lead, arguing
that the cost for major lenders would be far too high.
John Donaldson, Scottish regional general manager with the Halifax
Building Society, said: ''The removal of social security support from
next month is not going to be helpful. The national market needs a bit
of confidence, this is not a good time to make this sort of alteration.
We are looking at introducing some changes by October.
Lenders and insurers will not be able to cover us all against all of
the risks of unemployment without charging such high costs that few will
be able to afford it. The likely outcome is that they will offer
products which will ''cherry-pick'' the market -- low-cost insurance for
those who are healthy and in secure jobs, higher costs for those who
offer a higher risk. Many people are likely to find themselves refused
cover altogether.
Borrowers who decide to follow Mr Lilley's lead will find that it
currently costs around #25 per month to cover a typical #55,000 mortgage
against the risk of unemployment. Many such policies contain exclusions
which mean that there is a delay of between one month and three months
before they pay out.
Anyone who finds another job and then is unemployed again within a
short period might find that such multiple cover is excluded. People
over the age of 60 may find that they will be refused mortgage
protection insurance, as will those affected by certain medical
conditions.
Many people who are self-employed will have difficulty in buying cover
at all -- and those who are successful will find that they have to wind
up their business before their insurer will meet their claim.

ENGLAND v COLOMBIA
PAUL Gascoigne will sport a dark hairstyle when he takes the field at
Wembley tonight for the match against Colombia. The new look, however,
is staying secret until then.
The Rangers player paid #180 for a cut-and-colour by his favourite
stylist Harry Anastasi. After three hours, his golden locks were
transformed into a blue-black barnet.
Anastasi said: ''It needed cutting. It was blond but had grown out a
bit. Now it's a blue-black colour. The only problem is that souvenir
people have made up dolls based on Gazza being blond.''
With Gascoigne top of the bill, backed by a cast of Terry Venables'
bright young things, England should now avoid the embarrassment of
playing in front of the smallest Wembley crowd in their history tonight.
The FA had feared that ticket sales for the hastily-arranged friendly
against Colombia would dip below the miserable 15,628 who watched the
goalless draw against Chile in May 1989. But now they are forecasting a
steady walk-up crowd will push the attendance well past the 20,000 mark.
The Rangers player, who will start an England international for the
first time in 18 months, is joined by Venables' new generation --
Liverpool's Jamie Redknapp is given his debut and both his Anfield
team-mate Steve McManaman and Middlesbrough's new #5m striker, Nick
Barmby, their first England starts.
There is a recall, too, for Chelsea's trouble-prone winger Dennis Wise
in a dramatically reshaped line-up which sees David Seaman, Tony Adams
and Steve Howey back. But there is no place for in-form John Barnes,
while injury rules out Peter Beardsley.
However, Venables is convinced Gascoigne is fit to step up from his
three cameo appearances as substitute in the summer's Umbro Cup.
It is only the injury-jinxed play-maker's tenth start in the last 46
internationals, but he believes he is ready. ''I was strong in the
summer, but what I lacked was match fitness. I have had nine games since
I joined Rangers and I feel much fitter. I am ready,'' he said. England
team:
Seaman (Arsenal), Neville (Manchester United), Adams (Arsenal), Howey
(Newcastle), Le Saux (Blackburn), Barmby (Middlesbrough), Redknapp
(Liverpool), Gascoigne (Rangers), Wise (Chelsea), McMananam (Liverpool),
Shearer (Blackburn).

ATHLETICS: RIETI INTERNATIONAL
LINFORD Christie pulled away over the final 20 metres to capture the
100 metres at the Rieti International meeting last night. Christie
clocked 10.20 seconds in a steady downpour that forced officials to
cancel the men's pole vault and slowed times. Australian Damien Marsh
was second in 10.27.
Later, Christie again confirmed he is unlikely to run at the 1996
Olympics. ''I probably will not be competing in Atlanta,'' he said. ''I
took some sweet revenge after the World championships. I have nothing to
show at 35, except that athletics can be fun.''
World champion Michael Johnson was among those turning in impressive
performances despite the conditions, winning the 200m in 20.09, the
year's third best time.
''It's a fast track and I could have clocked a faster time, but the
weather was too bad,'' said the American.
Ireland's world champion, Sonia O'Sullivan, who had announced her
intention to try to break the women's mile world record, was an easy
winner but way off world-beating pace in 4min 29.82sec.
''It had nothing to do with the weather,'' said O'Sullivan. ''I was
just too tired.''
The second record attempt of the evening also came to nothing as
Kenya's Moses Kiptanui, the 3000m steeplechase world champion and record
holder, tried to set a world best for two miles.
Kiptanui, who ran an exhausting 5000m in Berlin last Friday, where he
was beaten by Ethiopian rival and record breaker Haile Gebresilassie,
clocked 8-13.40.
Noureddine Morceli, awarded the honorary citizenship of Rieti last
year after twice setting world records there, had a crack at breaking
his own 3000m record. The rain let up as the Algerian, with his brother
Ali pace-making, set off. Morceli hit 1000m on target and was four
seconds inside his record time at 2000m, but finished more than four
seconds outside the record in 7-29.36.
Britain's Jonathan Edwards, the world record holder in the triple
jump, did his best to warm up the crowd but his 17.29 metres leap was a
pale performance compared to the prodigious 18.29 he pulled off in
Gothenberg last month.
The Rieti meeting drew a spectacular field of 17 newly-crowned world
champions, many of them determined to show support for possibly the last
meeting in the central Italian town.
Organiser Sandro Giovannelli has said the lack of sponsorship and
increased costs of attracting a top field is likely to mean the
tenty-fifth meeting will be the last.

Fine tuning has improved Ford's best seller, says Ross Finlay
WHILE a lot of the attention being paid to Ford just now is directed
at the still to be released replacement Fiesta, the Escort remains the
best selling car of any make on the UK market, and one which has been
greatly improved by all this year's modifications.
From being a kind of lowest common denominator design, the Escort is a
much fresher car, compared with its direct rivals, than it was a couple
of years ago.
Ford has tinkered around with the front-end appearance of the Escort,
but not to my mind with much success. The current Escort look is a clear
demonstration of the fact that you simply cannot graft on a styling
element which is a mis-match with the rest of a body design, and expect
it to work fashion miracles. Where the car scores is in mechanical
refinement and interior changes.
The great blast of fresh air flowing around Ford's two most popular
model ranges is caused by the team working under the direction of
Richard Parry-Jones, who is lumbered with the corporate-speak title of
Vice-President, Ford Small/Medium Vehicle Centre. Parry-Jones himself is
very far from being the kind of stuffy character his title might
suggest.
One of his team's major projects in connection with the current Escort
range was to look at every single item -- down to individual nuts and
bolts, wiring grommets, or brackets rattling against whatever they are
attached to -- which might provoke those Three Horsemen of noise,
vibration and harshness. Even the sump was redesigned, because a certain
wind whistle was traced to the air running over its exposed lower
surface while the car was moving.
So there is no doubt whatever that the latest Escort is the smoothest
and quietest running example of this class of car that Ford has ever
built. While it is a modified version of an existing type, and not
anything like a complete re-design, it is the most sophisticated Escort
put on the market so far, with the best interior.
While there are some hot and some very hot Escorts, such as the fiery
RS Cosworth, Ford usually manages to include a mildly warmed-up version
somewhere in its catalogue, more modest in cost and insurance grouping.
That is the thinking behind the Escort Si, which comes with either a
1.6-litre or a 1.8-litre engine.
I have been driving a 1.6-litre Si, which costs #12,350 as a
three-door, #12,775 as a five-door, and #13,540 as an estate. The 90bhp
engine will take it to 60mph in about 11.5 seconds, and on to a test
track maximum of around 110mph. Fuel consumption figures are about 49mpg
at 56mph, 40mpg at 75mph and 31mpg in city traffic.
Admittedly, this is no tyre-burning specification or set of
performance figures. However, although some people enjoy coping with
cars which have more power than road-holding, I doubt that this is an
overwhelmingly popular sport. If you want to press on with the 1.6-litre
Si, you can give it the works and feel that it is motoring entirely
within its own natural limits. Driving a modestly-powered car as hard as
it will comfortably go is just as enjoyable for most of us as coping
with a super-abundance of bhp.
The ride and road-holding capabilities of the smaller engined Si are
rarely tested to the full. Neither does it get to the point of being
uncomfortably noisy or strained. That gives the driver an opportunity to
enjoy the excellent sports front seats and the much improved appearance
of the front cabin.
Instrument faces are in white, there are some stylish touches to the
switchgear, and the new fascia layout, complete with oval analogue
clock, does without the wood-effect finish which makes some critics grue
at the more expensive models in the Escort range.

ON the European Tour statistics front, most attention may have been
focused on Sam Torrance narrowing the gap at the top on Colin
Montgomerie with his top-10 finish in last weekend's European Masters,
but Scots also were involved lower down the rankings.
Aberdeen's Paul Lawrie, who has been struggling this season, picked up
#8382 for finishing joint seventeenth, and that moved him up to No.116
on just over #41,000. If he can remain in the top 120 -- and #50,000 is
the estimated minimum winnings -- he will avoid a return to the fraught
qualifying school, being held in November at San Roque and La Quinta.
Ross Drummond (No.113) and Stephen McAllister (No.108) are also in the
danger zone.
Gleddoch-based Dean Robertson lost ground in the battle to be top of
the 1994 tour school graduates. Sweden's Michael Jonzon finished joint
eleventh (#11,725) and extended his lead over the Scot, who was joint
twenty-fifth (#6825). The Swede is now #17,000 and 10 places ahead of
second-placed Robertson.
Sandy Lyle moved up to No.34 with his joint-sixth finish which was
worth #21,000, while Mike Miller, currently outside the top 150, picked
up #2200 for joint fifty-seventh. The Lenzie man was playing in
yesterday's pre-qualifying school at Slaley Hall -- where he shot a
one-over-par 73 -- as a precaution.
Gary Orr's closing 77 dropped him to joint sixty-first place worth
only #1574, but the 1993 rookie of the year is still healthily placed at
No.56, one ahead of Adam Hunter, the winner in March of the Portuguese
Open.
Montgomerie finished in joint eleventh place, bringing his prize-money
to #474,241, and Torrance's joint ninth finish took him to #444,149.

GOLF: LANCOME TROPHY
NICK Faldo has pulled out of this week's Lancome Trophy in Paris after
injuring his right wrist yesterday.
Faldo was involved in a company day in Germany when he jarred the
wrist, although a spokesman for his management company said that his
withdrawal was precautionary, with the Ryder Cup only a fortnight away.
But it is another worry that European captain Bernard Gallacher could
have done without.
There are already concerns over the state of Jose Maria Olazabal's
foot, which may prevent him playing more than one round a day, while
Seve Ballesteros, Bernhard Langer, and David Gilford have had back
trouble recently.
The Lancome tournament was to have been Faldo's last event before the
Ryder Cup in Oakhill, Rochester.
''There is nothing to panic about,'' added the spokesman, stating that
Faldo will be practising all next week in Florida with his coach David
Leadbetter.
It has been a desperately disappointing season for Faldo and the Ryder
Cup represents a chance for him to reassert himself. He will be
equalling the Ryder Cup record of Irishman Christy O'Connor by making
his tenth appearance.
Faldo rejoined the American Tour this season and won an early event,
but has not featured in any of the four major championships.
TEN members of Europe's Ryder Cup team will fly direct from Rochester
after the match against the United States to compete in the Smurfit
European Open in Ireland from September 28 to October 1.
Howard Clark, David Gilford, Mark James, Per-Ulrik Johansson, Bernhard
Langer, Colin Montgomerie, Jose Maria Olazabal, Costantino Rocca, Sam
Torrance, and Philip Walton will be challenging for the first prize of
#108,330 from a total fund of #650,000.
Gilford is the defending champion, while Olazabal and Rocca tied for
second place last year, with Montgomerie fourth and Clark equal-fifth.
Tom Lehman, a member of the United States Ryder Cup team, has also
entered the tournament at the Kildare Hotel and Country Club, near
Dublin.

SAXON Maid can spearhead Luca Cumani's two-pronged attack on the Group
3 Stones Bitter Park Hill Stakes on the opening day of Doncaster's St
Leger meeting tomorrow.
Cumani runs Saxon Maid and Noble Rose -- both in the ownership of
Sheikh Mohammed -- and although the pair are difficult to separate,
slight preference is for the former.
Saxon Maid has progressed through the ranks of handicap company,
winning three races last season, including the November Handicap here 10
months ago.
This season she has continued her progress, taking a couple of outings
to come to hand before landing the Listed Fred Archer Stakes at
Newmarket, beating Magical Retreat.
She followed up with a success in the Foster's Silver Cup at York --
also a Listed race -- and once again beat Magical Retreat, going to the
front a quarter-of-a-mile from home and staying on for a
two-and-a-half-lengths win.
It is more than likely that the ground for the Tiffany Goodwood Cup
next time was too fast for her, as she finished a below-par sixth to
Double Trigger.
Saxon Maid's disappointing showing under top weight in the Tote Ebor
at York is more difficult to explain as, even though she was handicapped
up to her best form, she was entitled to finish closer to the front than
seventeenth.
However, it may well pay to forgive that effort in this smaller field,
with most of her rivals either disappointing of late, or with
improvement to find in this company.
Saxon Maid herself has yet to make her mark in Pattern races but, over
this exended mile-and-three-quarters and with recent rain having taken
the sting out of the ground, she has the ideal opportunity here.
Of her rivals, stablemate Noble Rose may well provide the main danger.
This Caerleon filly showed very useful form last season and although
unable to cut any ice in the Lancashire or Yorkshire Oaks, is likely to
appreciate this step-up in distance.
Sailormaite is a hopeful selection in the 22-runner Tote-Portland
Handicap.
As with all the large-field sprint handicaps, punters are very much up
against it but those who get it right are in for rich rewards.
Roy Bowring's four-year-old has been in very good form of late,
winning six-furlong handicaps at Haydock and Wolverhampton, and he
showed his effectiveness over the minimum trip when a short-head second
to Name The Tune in a rated stakes at Ascot.
The trip on this occasion -- five furlongs and 140 yards -- should
suit him well and Sailormaite is taken to give Bowring his biggest
success to date.
The listed Scarborough Stakes looks a difficult race to assess but
Henry Candy's Eveningperformance will go close if reproducing his
half-length second to Hever Golf Rose in the Group 3 King George Stakes
at Glorious Goodwood last month.

Stewart Fraser finds modern marine technology plays a major role on
larger cruisers
THE modern cruiser demonstrates the steady progress in marine
technology. Compare the bigger Jeanneaus, for example, with their
counterparts of some decades back.
The Sun Odyssey 45.1 at just over 46ft overall uses its beam of almost
15ft to provide masses of room below decks. A broad stern gives an
option of two double cabins aft or a really spacious owner's cabin.
Traditional wooden hulls, with their necessarily robust scantlings,
simply did not provide such space. They are warm and cosy, certainly,
but by no means spacious.
Modern craft can often look like plastic soap dishes -- the equivalent
of jelly moulds with some cars. The Sun Odyssey will keep the
traditionalist happy, with its fine lines, moderate freeboard, and
smooth finish.
The craft looks right, and inherent strength comes from the special
Kevlar reinforced material used, laid up by hand to ensure quality.
In place of the old-style long keel there is a fin and skeg
arrangement giving sharp tacking. The deep keel takes 6ft 7in and even
the shallow version comes in at 5ft 3in.
An unusual but welcome cruising arrangement is having shrouds and
genoa track well inboard. It leaves around 2ft of walking space on the
side deck and certainly makes for ease of sail handling.
With all lines led aft to the cockpit, to six jammers either side of
the main hatch leading to a pair of Harken 44 self-tailers, with an
additional pair of Harken 53s aft of the handrails, it is a boat a
family can handle with confidence.
Three of us set out in the relatively light airs of recent days,
heading from Largs for Millport under a 622 sq ft genoa and 375 sq ft
main. Hoisting was merely a case of pulling on the sheets.
The genoa is taken in with the furling drum below deck in its own
forward hatch, leaving more space at the pulpit and keeping the sail
well down. The main, as is increasingly accepted today, is loose footed
and fully furling --within the mast in this case.
Boat handling in a good wind is pretty straightforward. Moving sweetly
in light winds is the tricky part. This Sun Odyssey ate up the space
between shore and the Cumbraes in very satisfactory manner.
An electronics expert took time off crewing to explain the extensive
instrumentation aboard. In simple terms, aspects such as boat speed,
true and apparent wind speed and angle, together with boat's heading,
have a constant interface with the boat's position, from a GPS satellite
system, and the variable radar screen picture.
In terms of boat control, it meant we could see on-screen the tidal
set, its effect on our speed and heading, and the course made good.
With an auto-pilot included, we could also set a given heading and
know the boat would retain it, or apply a tacking angle -- to take
effect when we chose. And with not one but two outside steering wheels,
line of vision was exemplary.
An 85 hp turbo-charged Yanmar (60 hp is standard) gives a top speed of
around 9 knots and makes for straight-line steering in reverse.
A visit below decks is needed to appreciate the built-in touches of
luxury living on this #185,000 craft. There are three showers, a fridge
and in the saloon a wet-bar with anti-heel glass racks.
The deck hatches have their own sunblinds, which are handy for privacy
when rafted up. And the polished woodwork positively gleams. Not
surprisingly, the navigatorium -- navigator's space -- has a full range
of instruments labelled in French and English.
About the only extra I could think of was possibly a bow thruster, for
pontoon work in boisterous conditions. And that's available as an
option.

ENGINEERING group IMI is taking the knife to a chunk of its
loss-making titanium business which supplies the aerospace industry,
writes CHRIS STONE.
This will mean a #20m reorganisation charge on profits in the second
half, but the decisive action received market approval and the shares
firmed 5p to 322p, spurred also by some encouraging progress elsewhere
in the group.
About 200 jobs will go but #12m of the exceptional charge will be a
write down of assets with the balance mostly spent in 1996.
IMI's first-half results to June 30, meanwhile, saw profits advance
32% at the pre-tax level from #37m to #39m, but this is partly due to
the inclusion of losses of #8.3m on discontinued operations in the same
period last year.
Stripping these out leaves operating profits ahead by 7% from #48.7m
to #52.1m ahead of tax and interest.
Special engineering, though, saw operating profits slide from #8.6m to
#1.4m and the company will stop manufacturing in certain unprofitable
product areas, mostly on the fringe, as it remains committed to core
contracts which supply Rolls-Royce and Pratt &amp; Whitney. These measures
are expected to bring a return to profits in 1996.
In the rest of the picture there are plenty of bright spots. In
building products, IMI Copper Tube and IMI Refiners enjoyed an excellent
half-year due to high copper prices and better margins.
The fittings activity achieved further growth in Europe, particularly
Germany, although some levelling of demand was apparent towards the end
of the period. Not surprisingly the waterheating businesses continued to
struggle in the depressed UK housing market, but recent acquisition
Andrews &amp; Homart performed well in the commercial market.
IMI Air Conditioning improved significantly following major
rationalisation in 1994. Meanwhile, in drinks dispensing, results in the
US levelled off after a steep rise in demand throughout last year but
there was continued strength in the Pacific Rim, a resurgence of
activity in Continental Europe and increased sales in the UK.
Gearing is down from 30% to 24% and the company, which is chaired by
Sir Eric Pountain, has already stated that it is looking for
acquisitions in the US and Europe.
Shareholders are to receive an increase in their interim dividend
payout from 4.4p to 4.6p on earnings per share up 30% at 9.5p.

Taunton cider, whose
brands include Blackthorn and Diamond White, is in talks which may
lead to an offer for the company.
The news saw its shares bubble up 29p to 212p. The froth in the share
price failed to be damped down by the disclosure that the talks involved
substantial preconditions.
Taunton, the UK's second-biggest cider-maker, said it had noted recent
speculation about a possible bid for the company and would make a
further announcement when appropriate.
Although consumer interest in cider has grown in the past few years,
the group has suffered from the two-year price war that has affected the
industry, leading to restructuring to reduce operating costs. Costs
associated with reorganising the business hit profits last year. In
July, the company reported a 22% drop in profits for the year to April
29 to #15.8m.
Last week chairman Michael Garner told shareholders at the annual
meeting that cider sales had boomed during the summer. ''The cider
market continues to grow strongly, with volumes up by 11% in the year to
June,'' he told the meeting.
''Since then, we have enjoyed a long period of warm and sunny weather
which has boosted sales still further. ''Our own sales volumes for the
year so far are ahead of plan and substantially above the equivalent
period last year.''
In contrast to the buoyancy of Taunton's share price, Boddington's was
11p cheaper at 281p as the market reflected its disappointment with
interim profits at the low end of expectations. The company reported
pre-tax profits for the six months to July 2 of #13.4m, a rise of 3%.
Margins in the drinks wholesaling business, Liquid Assets, fell by
more than had been anticipated. Profits halved to #1.3m. The national
brewers are doing a lot of discounting through their own wholesale
systems.
Boddington's faced a slight price increase in supplies from those
national brewers so margins were squeezed, although some recovery is
expected in the second half.
The hot weather in July and August was of particular benefit to the
pubs division. The performance of other divisions, which include hotels
and nursing homes, was in line with expectations.
A seventh Village Leisure hotel is due to open in October and another
is scheduled for opening next year, in Leeds. Boddington's remains on
the lookout for further sites.
The nursing home business performed well in the first half with
like-for-like profits up 7%.
The group purchased 10 nursing homes from BUPA last December which
boosted sales by 78% in the first half. The acquisition catapulted
Boddington's to the top of the premium sector of the nursing home market
with a large presence in South-east England.
Boddington's interim dividend was raised by 8.6% to 3.42p reflecting
the board's confidence in its future prospects.

<TEXT>
THE Halifax Building Society has decided to have just two reference
dates for checking members' savings balances to calculate their
entitlement to free shares when the group is floated.
The first will be November 25, 1994 as already announced, and members,
including those formerly with Leeds Permanent, will be given several
weeks warning of the second date. This has yet to be fixed but will be
in late 1996.
Members must have at least the same amount in their qualifying account
on the second date as on November 25 last year to receive their maximum
entitlement. The balance can vary between the dates, though Halifax
strongly recommends that at least #100 is maintained.
The number of free shares received will depend on the whichever of the
two balances is the lower.
The other important date is the ''qualifying day'', the reference date
at which the two-year condition will be fixed.
The share hand-out will be in two parts, a basic distribution of a
fixed number to all qualifying members plus a variable distribution
which will be made to those who have been members for at least two years
on the qualifying day.

THE Scotch Quality Beef and Lamb Association has reported an
encouraging response to its campaign to persuade butchers to insist on
Scottish-produced meat, writes DAN BUGLASS.
It is exactly a year since it launched a scheme to enrol butchers
throughout the UK as associate members of the Guild of Scotch Quality
Beef Suppliers.
The fierceness of the competition for markets is demonstrated by the
announcement that Marks &amp; Spencer is to begin selling New Zealand
chilled lamb next summer -- a sales period that used to be reserved for
fresh lamb.
Brian Simpson, the chief exectuive of SQBLA, said: ''The guild
recruitment has been an unbelievable success story. Since the initiative
started last year we have signed up over 700 butchers throughout the UK.
That now makes us the biggest marketing group in Europe.
''We have butchers actively promoting and selling Scotch beef and lamb
all the way from Orkney to the Isle of Wight. We even have 33 members in
Wales. So successful has the operation been that instead of us having to
go out and seek members they are now queuing up to join.''
He added: ''The importance of this to Scottish farmers is impossible
to quantify. We have established the traceability of the product, and
that is vital nowadays both to the major supermarkets and to the small
retail family butcher.
''For the farmer the message is clear -- he is seeing his product
positioned at the top of an increasingly competitive market. He has
growing protection of the brand via farm insurance, which is rapidly
gaining widespread approval, and also through the guild. There is a
long-term commitment and investment by the trade in the Scotch
product.''
It also has emerged that some of the top chefs in the UK now see the
Scotch image as one they can sell, with the Earl of Bradford, the
honorary president of the Master Chefs of Great Britain, advising his
members to join the guild as associates.
This is reflected in the statistics which show that since the launch
of the Scotch Beef Club before the Highland Show in June 1994 no fewer
than 81 leading restaurants in the UK have become members. Others
anxious to enlist are, according to Mr Simpson, ''making significant
effort to source Scottish beef''.
He added: ''The value of promotion is beyond estimate and has
strengthened our relationship with leading chefs who now regard SQBLA as
being colleagues. We are doing all we can to help those who want more of
our beef to find suppliers who can provide those requirements on a
regular basis.''

SCOTTISHPOWER shares advanced a further 5[1/2]p to 351[1/2]p yesterday
as institutional investors piled in, anticipating a successful outcome
to the company's #1000m hostile takeover bid for Manweb.
''Institutional players are increasing their weighting in
ScottishPower,'' said Bill McCall, an analyst with Edinburgh broker
Tilney.
Norwich Union and Schroders have each spent more than #15m on buying
ScottishPower shares over the last two days.
''What we have got is institutional switching from the over-performing
stocks to the under-performing ones,'' Mr McCall said.
The latest rise in ScottishPower shares brings the current value of
the company's shares-plus-cash offer for Manweb to 994p. Although Manweb
shares rose a further 7p to 991p yesterday, they still lagged behind.
''I think people are starting to look at what ScottishPower will look
like after the purchase of Manweb and they see that it's earnings
enhancing and that it's attractive,'' said Andrew Wright, an electricity
analyst at broker Smith New Court in London.
He noted that ScottishPower shares were trading above 400p only 15
months ago and said that in the current optimistic atmosphere there was
still room for them to move above present levels.
A further 6[1/2]p rise would take the value of its offer for Manweb to
more than #10 from a starting figure of 946p per share in July 24.
Manweb has until September 15 to publish its defence against the
ScottishPower bid, which was cleared by the government last week.
But Mr Wright said institutional investors were warming to the idea of
an enlarged ScottishPower with three million customers that could slash
Manweb's high electricity distribution costs.
Such a company would be equal in size to Eastern, the largest regional
electricity company at present, and well placed to face the deregulation
of electricity supply in 1998, he said.

PIG producers in Scotland can almost certainly look forward to a
buoyant market until next summer, as it is now clear that the huge
English breeding herd has contracted more than expected and a decline is
visible in the number of slaughter pigs being fattened.
Early estimates based on the June farm livestock census in England
suggest breeding pig numbers may not have fallen quite as sharply as in
Scotland, but the slide has nevertheless been dramatic.
The mid-year tally of sows being either suckled or kept for further
breeding appears to have been down by 10,000 head, nearly 8% from June
1994, and the maiden gilt herd contracted by more than 5% for the second
successive year.
Cutbacks on this scale may be slightly embarrassing for some
economists at the Meat and Livestock Commission (MLC), who were
suggesting until only a few months ago that the buoyant pig market might
have prompted a mild degree of expansion by late summer.
But even the MLC has been cutting its breeding herd forecasts
recently, and this week senior economist Mick Sloyan said: ''Lack of
producer confidence is obviously still having a powerful effect.
Producers are looking at feed prices, and they don't like what they see.
And they know the stall and tether ban is not far away.''
Even British Pig Association chief executive Grenville Welsh, who had
frequently disputed the MLC's formerly rather optimistic forecasts, was
surprised by the scale of the herd contraction evident in the new
figures. ''Judging by these census results, sow numbers have not
bottomed out yet,'' he said.
Both agree it would be almost impossible for slaughter pig production
to begin recovering until well into next year on the basis of these
breeding herd estimates.
''Even if sow numbers started rising again now, we could not see much
of a rise in clean pig slaughterings before about July,'' said Mr Welsh.
According to Mr Sloyan: ''Maybe there will be some stability by
mid-year, but even that looks doubtful.''
Their comments offer encouragement to producers who may have been
worried by recent reports suggesting a price crash is imminent because
the Japanese, who have been buying pigmeat throughout Europe in the last
few weeks, will probably pull out of the market soon. A further reason
for expecting temporary price weakness before long is the after-effect
of the heatwave.
Pigs will have grown more slowly during the hot weather, which appears
to have been confirmed by slaughterhouse through-put estimates showing
the July and August kill down by about 5% from a year earlier, whereas
the June census indicated numbers approaching slaughter weight only
about 2% lower than in mid-1994.
A temporary surge is to be expected as the cooler weather accelerates
liveweight gain and brings these pigs into the abattoir.
However, the census results also showed an extremely sharp drop,
nearly 6%, in the number of very young pigs likely to reach slaughter
weight in the autumn, taking account of the heat-induced growth
slowdown.

AYRSHIRE farmers' big effort on behalf of the Hansel Village at
Symington raised #85,000 in an auction at James Craig's cattle market at
Whitefordhill, by Ayr.
More than 200 prime lambs, 40 breeding sheep, 100 beef calves, 60
store cattle and 30 pedigree cattle came under the auctioneer's hammer.
The sale was started by Mike Craig who came out of retirement for the
occasion.
The top price of #1600 was realised for a pedigree Friesian calf which
was donated by Strutt &amp; Parker Farms in Essex. Two others of the same
breed which topped the #1000 mark came from the Yates brothers of East
Logan, Castle Douglas, and from Logan Kennedy, chairman of the steering
committee of the farmers' appeal.
The money raised will go towards a #500,000 appeal for the
redevelopment of Wilson House, one of Hansel's residential units.

IVORY &amp; Sime's Pacific Assets Trust has turned in a sterling
performance in its latest six months, confirming its position as the top
investment trust in its sector.
The #156m trust, which is managed from Ivory's Hong Kong office,
increased its net asset value by 23.2% to 131.2p over the six months to
July 31. Shareholders had a total return of 49.5% in the value of their
investment.
The shares were split into four new shares of 12.5p for every old one
and new warrants were issued on the basis of one for every five new
shares.
Pacific Assets was the best performing trust in its sector during the
six months. Over one year it was second only to TR Pacific. It also
leads its peer group over 10 years.
Ivory &amp; Sime investment trust director, Gordon Neilly, said: ''These
excellent shorter term results and Pacific Assets Trust's fine 10-year
record demonstrate the considerable strength of Ivory and Sime's
investment team in the region.''
Mr Neilly attributed the trust's strong performance to its 32%
exposure to the Hong Kong market, the top performer in the region, and
gearing of just under 30%.
Pacific Assets achieved a double-digit return from every country in
the region, except Taiwan.
Earnings per share dropped from 0.55p to 0.50p.

Hillsdown Holdings' chief executive David Newton said sales in July
and August of Cadbury's chocolate covered biscuits fell by 9% while
sales of drinking chocolate slumped by 24%.
The group came under unremitting margin pressure in the first half of

write-offs on disposals of #125m.
The interim dividend is held at 2.2p.

THE Nationwide Building Society has undercut its two biggest rivals in
the mortgage market, the Halifax Building Society and Abbey National, in
the latest round of home loan rate reductions.
The society, Britain's second largest, reduced its variable rate for
mortgages by 0.49% to 7.95%. On Friday the Abbey National reduced its
rate to 7.99% in a move to stimulate the moribund housing market and on
Monday the Halifax, the largest building society, matched it.
The Nationwide's new rates are effective from today for new borrowers
and from October 1 for existing borrowers. The society has also launched
a new range of preferential fixed and variable rate offers aimed at
those moving house.
Among other lenders cutting rates were the Dunfermline from 8.45% to
7.99% and Barclays Bank from 8.35% to 7.99%.

<HEADLINE>Depressed results reflect decline in housebuilding. No recovery yet for Wimpey</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>CHRISTOPHER SIMS</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>19</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>976519335</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE recession in the housebuilding industry was highlighted yesterday
by official figures showing a decline in starts in recent months and the
biggest housebuilder, Wimpey, reporting a little more than break-even
position in the first half of the year.
Housing starts in the three months to July were 2% below the previous
three months and well down on the same period in 1994. In July
completions were slightly ahead of the same month last year, but new
starts were 19% down.
With construction still also deeply depressed, Wimpey made profits of
just #1m in the six months to June, down from #7.5m. But it is holding
the interim dividend at 2p.
In contrast with other leading housebuilders, such as number two in
the industry Tarmac and Balfour Beatty, who want out, Wimpey has every
intention of hanging in there and is pinning its hopes on an upturn next
year ahead of the election. But with John Major apparently turning a
deaf ear to the industry's clamourings for help in the November Budget,
there could be only a shallow recovery in 1996, which would be
insufficient to justify Wimpey's land purchases.
The group geared up to increase its landbank last year and early this,
starting 1995 with 20,500 plots -- enough for three years work at rates
then prevailing. It spent a further #53m in the first half. Land values
were bid up as other builders anticipated a better market. The danger
now is that if there is no recovery landbanks will have to be written
down.
Wimpey started the year with virtually no gearing and now has 38%
which is still relatively modest. But it could have done without the
higher first-half financing costs of #7.5m against #4m.
The group managed to maintain sales volume but at the expense of
margins as selling prices were flat. It builds 1400 homes a year in
Scotland where it has 13% of a market which is marginally more active
than in England. Overseas completions were down but are expected to
improve in the second half. Housebuilding profits overall were 23% lower
at #8.1m.
While committed to housebuilding, Wimpey is prepared to pull out of
contracting which remains as difficult as ever. It has always been a
low-margin business but compensates for this by being cash generative.
However, this is changing. While margins are likely to remain tight
for the foreseeable future, it is starting to generate less cash. So
another round of job cuts is in prospect, with Wimpey chief executive
Joe Dwyer anticipating a staff roll 10% to 15% smaller than the current
worldwide total of 5000 direct employees. This implies at least 200 job
losses in the UK. The bulk of the labour comes from sub-contractors.
Wimpey intends to concentrate on partnership arrangements, design and
build, property trading and the private finance initiative. Mr Dwyer is
positive about this, if only the Treasury mandarins will provide enough
financial support.
It is the interface between the guardians of the public purse, who
have no experience at all of business, and the industry which is the
problem. Mr Dwyer reckons that unless the logjam is broken within a year
the Government can forget about the whole idea.
Wimpey's order book has been maintained at #595m. Work on the M77,
which was disrupted by environmental protesters, is now going well.
Its saviour in the first half was the minerals division which
recovered sharply from break-even to profits of #6m, helped by the March
purchase of McAlpine Minerals, which is performing as hoped. Volume and
prices moved forward and the positive trend should continue.
Mr Dwyer accepts that full-year profits will not match 1994's #45m.
Analysts were perturbed by the #39m cash outflow from construction and
cut their estimates.
Some #40m may be all Wimpey can muster and it is too early to view the
shares, down 2p at 102p, as a recovery punt.

TULLOCH Construction Group is following up five years of rapid growth
in Scotland with a move into England.
The Inverness-based construction company has landed an #8.5m contract
to build a shopping centre in Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria.
The deal with London-based property developer Teesland is the biggest
single contract ever signed by Tulloch in its 70-year history.
''Our controlled growth, which has seen turnover rise by 400% in the
past five years with profits maintaining momentum, inevitably has
brought England increasingly into our consideration,'' said managing
director David Sutherland.
Tulloch aims to establish a permanent presence south of the Border by
setting up a joint venture with Warwick Construction, a small building
company based in the Wirral peninsula with an annual turnover of #9m.
The joint venture, known as Warwick Tulloch Developments, will
undertake projects in the Manchester and Liverpool areas and North
Wales.
''We are actively progressing with specific projects in those areas,''
Mr Sutherland said.
Tulloch has expanded from the Highlands into the central belt since it
was bought out by its management in 1989. The company made a pre-tax
profit of #900,000 on turnover of #46m in the year to March 31.
The move into England has prompted a management reorganisation.
George Fraser, who until now was director of the Highland division,
has been appointed deputy managing director with special responsibility
for operations in Scotland.
This will allow Mr Sutherland to concentrate on drumming up new
business.

MURRAY International Holdings, the owner of Rangers football club,
returned to profit last year after a solid performance by its metal
stockholding yards.
The group owned by millionaire David Murray made a pre-tax profit of
#2.3m in the year to January 31 after a loss of #1.8m previously.
Group turnover was little changed at #215.5m, up from #213.8m,
previously.
But sales by the metals division rose 11% to #121.4m, offsetting an 8%
decline to #67.4m in the electronics and electrical retailing division.
Turnover at Murray International's football division rose 10% to #19m.
Strong growth in the metals division was helped by the opening of a
stockholding yard in Singapore and another in Stavanger, Norway, serving
the offshore oil industry.
The group's Austin Tummans subsidiary also expanded its metal
stockholding business into South-west England and Ireland.
Murray International's return to financial health followed the
disposal of its office equipment businesses over a period of two years.
''The strategic move away from non-core activities is almost complete
and has been vindicated by solid performances in all key operating
areas,'' Mr Murray, the group chairman, said.
Despite the move back to profit last year, the volume of debt falling
due within one year increased sharply to #46.1m from #35.1m.
But Mr Murray said an encouraging start to the current financial year
should help the group to reduce its debt burden.
Managing director Jim MacDonald said Murray International was
performing strongly across the board. ''Underlying trading is
excellent,'' he said. Mr MacDonald predicted ''very positive results
this year''.
He highlighted a strong improvement at the Mimtec electronic factories
in Livingston and Gourock, which mainly manufacture personal computers
for IBM.
The two plants had taken on several hundred new employees this year to
cope with an increased workload, Mr MacDonald said.
Murray International currently employs 2700 people worldwide, of whom
2000 work in Scotland.
The group sold its Electric City music stores in New Zealand three
months ago to concentrate on building up its Bond &amp; Bond chain of
electrical retail stores in the country.
Mr MacDonald said the restructuring of Murray International was more
or less complete and from now on the group would concentrate on organic
growth in its core activities.
He said Rangers remained in profit last year and should do even better
in 1995 following the club's entry to the European Champions League.
Rangers play their first Champions League match against Steaua
Bucharest in Romania on Wednesday.
Mr MacDonald declined to specify the level of profit at Ibrox, saying
the club's results would be posted to shareholders within the next
fortnight.
But he said Rangers had spent #8m on new players over the summer, of
which the lion's share -- #4.5m -- was spent on securing Paul Gascoigne
from the Italian team Lazio.
The club was also spending a further #4m was on fitting 4000 extra
seats into the corners of Ibrox stadium and installing large corner
video screens, he added. These improvements, which will raise its total
seating capacity to 51,000.
David Murray, who founded Murray International in 1974 as a one-man
steel stockholding business, still owns an 88% stake in the group. Noble
Grossart Investments and Bank of Scotland own the remainder.
Mr MacDonald said there were no plans to float the company on the
stock exchange ''for the forseeable future''.

LORD Fraser, the Department of Trade and Industry Minister with
reponsibility for the Offshore Supplies Office (OSO), yesterday said
there was a #50bn-a-year export opportunity for UK supply companies,
writes GRAEME SMITH.
During a visit to Offshore Europe, Lord Fraser said his remit in the
new Government position was to ensure that Scottish and UK companies
gained as big a percentage of that global market as possible but
declined to set any targets.
He said the #50bn was what was available after taking account of the
proportion of work domestic companies in each country might be expected
to win.
He announced that he would be setting up a ministerial office within
the OSO in Glasgow because of the importance of the offshore markets to
overall UK exports, and said he had been impressed with the OSO
operation in the city.
''I am confident of the level of expertise and the quality of contacts
that are maintained with the oil industry in the United Kingdom and I
would hope to be able to give my support and warm encouragement to all
that is done there,'' he said.
He welcomed the announcement of the award of a #60m order for the
Kvaerner yard at Govan for a roll-on, roll-off ferry as a support vessel
for a satellite-launching installation and said that the company's bid
had been supported by both the Scottish Office and the DTI.

SHAREHOLDERS in Shell Transport &amp; Trading, the UK arm of the Royal
Dutch/Shell Group, were told yesterday that they can expect to receive
dividend growth at a similar rate to previous years despite the stronger
pound.
Speaking in Aberdeen at a news conference at the Offshore Europe 1995
oil and gas exhibition, Shell UK chairman and chief executive Chris Fay
said: ''We will achieve it by stronger performance.''
He acknowledged that UK shareholders over the past few years had
received higher dividend growth than investors in Royal Dutch due to the
weakness of sterling against the guilder.
Some analysts had expressed concern that the rate of dividend growth
would be difficult to maintain now that the pound appears to have
stabilised against the mark-bloc currencies.
Mr Fay said cost cutting in the UK operation improved the cost base,
but noted that there were more cost reductions to come. Earlier this
year Royal Dutch/Shell said it would undertake a sweeping reorganisation
of its global management structure.
The company has already announced that the new structure, due to come
into force early next year, should save some #188m. About 1200 jobs are
expected to go. Mr Fay said yesterday, though, that he expected the new
organisation would be in place by January 1.
He also said that, while the British oil refining sector is labouring
under excess capacity, simply closing capacity may not be the solution.
''My biggest fear is that if we're not careful we will end up exporting
yet another industry outside Europe.
''We won't just have overcapacity, we will end up closing down too
much capacity because the industry doesn't know what to invest in at the
moment,'' he said.
He was unwilling to endorse a recent call by Total chairman Thierry
Desmarest for a co-ordinated move to reduce the estimated 20%
overcapacity in West European refining capacity. ''Well, co-ordinated
move is a very dangerous statement,'' he said.
* MEANWHILE, Dr Fay issued a warning to Shetland Island Council that
no-one could remain in the ''golden world'' and if it did not drop its
charges oil would no longer go to the Sullom Voe terminal, writes GRAEME
SMITH.
Operators in the Northern North Sea are looking at the feasibility of
offshore loading as a more cost effective method of exporting oil after
2000 when the existing contracts run out.
Negotiations have been going on over possible reductions, but Dr Fay
said the Sullom Voe terminal had ''an awful long way to go'' before it
became competitive.
''There is no unique position which says that one party to the total
industry is still in the golden world,'' he said.
''They have got to be competitive and if they compete I would suggest
this industry will give them the work. If they cannot compete then I
would suggest this industry will be obligated to its stakeholders to go
other ways.
''I am not so sure they have totally woken up to how far they have to
go yet, but I welcome the move in the right direction. I personally
believe that deep down they understand the question and how long the
game goes on is interesting.
''I still maintain it is in their interests to go quicker rather than
slower.''

DON Coutts's description of John Macleod's world was chilling
(September 1). Only in Scotland where the sick of Calvinism has still to
be recycled could such an exchange take place.
Readers not infrequently refer to John Macleod's rantings and ravings
but few try to understand them or to have compassion for him.
Such rantings are usually associated with the turmoil of an
unconscious mind which dreads and hates elements of itself and projects
these vehemently on to others.
It is never surprising that a mind in such a quandary links
frenetically with its word-store to give it off-centre and novel
expression. To be a repressed Calvinist must be true torture,
desperately in need of aid and succour.
No, the target should not be John Macleod. It should be the media that
give him outlet -- especially The Herald.
Normally such a person would resort to the pulpit but John Macleod has
been landed also with a level of arrogance which doesn't allow him to be
satisfied with such a limited platform.
One would hope to see someone like this being guided by paternal
balance. But his father (Professor Donald Macleod) is himself embroiled
and scrabbling among the footnotes of this same Calvinism, and his
attempts to clothe its remnants in new light resulted in a thuggish
onslaught on him from the fundamentalist hard-core earlier this year
which nearly annihilated him. And we all felt for him.
Getting dogma out of one's system is never easy once one has made the
necessary public statement of acceptance of it. One can cope with it
only by compartmentalising the mind. Iain Crichton Smith may write that
''it is time to turn the blow-lamp on dogma'', but he has not found
himself locked within its terrible paradigm.
The dying screech of our Calvinistic hegemony is what is being heard
from John Macleod, and it must give rise to disgust and even anguish in
some readers, while it fills others with pity for the ''sinful
sufferer''.

THE martyrdom of the Baha'i religious minority at the hands of an
Islamic government is an awful example of the fate which may await the
Orthodox Serbs at the hands of an Islamic government in Bosnia.
Even moderate Islamic governments, as in Algeria and Egypt, can offer
no high probability that fundamentalists will not have their way
eventually (as the Coptic Christians in Egypt know to their cost).
Is the Islamic religion inherently evil, and only showing a
presentable face in Scotland because of the huge majority of Scots who
want a basically Christian country, or is the religion inherently good,
but the good men in it are too weak to control, by excommunication or
otherwise, their murderous fundamentalists?

I READ the essay by Will McMillan with incredulity (September 2). Is
he trying to tell us that paid employment is the be-all and end-all of
life on the planet? He even brings in a spiritual dimension to work.
Perhaps Arbeit macht frei?
I would suggest an alternative to his argument. The worst thing that
ever happened to Scotland was Knox and the Protestant work ethic. That
ethic gave us the Victorian hell-holes called factories in Glasgow and
Lanarkshire. Gave us children working a 60-hour week to enable Sir Fred
Catherwood to live a life of luxury with the spare time to pontificate
on the Protestant work ethic.
There can only be one criterion for work, that is how much is my
employer willing to pay? After all it is my time he is buying. All work
is ''mundane and boring'' where you work for a wage.
At one point in his essay he brings in the Government. What has
employment got to do with the Government? If you have a house, money to
buy food and clothing, what else does he want?
He lives in Edinburgh, a city stuffed with libraries and museums, most
of them free of charge. If he is on income support he can get help with
bus passes, reduction in community charges, free medical treatment and
so on. Hunger and want have been taken out of the equation.
If he is seeking spiritual enlightenment I am sure there are a
multitude of kirks and chapels in Edinburgh where he can seek solace.
It might be a good idea to combine John Macleod and Will McMillan.
What a team they would make. We could return to the days of the
Covenanters and cleanse Scotland with the slogan: ''Those who will not
work neither shall they eat.''

I WASN'T surprised when I heard of the turnabout by the Constitutional
Convention regarding the proposed financing of Labour's Union Jock
parliament. What was surprising was the timing.
I know there will be some sincere and dedicated devolutionaries who
honestly thought the Labour Party was prepared to hammer out an
agreement. I know some of them have experienced what my colleagues and I
learned the hard way at Westminster between 1976-79.
New Labour/Old SDP has no intention of bringing about any kind of
Scottish parliament other than one of a Mickey Mouse variety, a
reincarnation of Strathclyde Regional Council writ a bit larger.
Those members of the convention and your readers will, I think, come
to the same conclusion once they perceive that there are absolutely no
powers of entrenchment of the proposed new parliament.
This means that any subsequent Westminster Parliament, Labour or Tory,
can do just the same as Mrs Thatcher when she took power in 1979. Her
first act in government was to kill off the Scotland Act which too might
have brought Scotland some kind of assembly.

YOUR report (September 1) of Sir Alick Rankin's remarks at the annual
meeting of Scottish and Newcastle reveals the most pathetic and
far-fetched of all scare stories against self-government. He is
apparently afraid than an English ''backlash'' would damage the sales of
his beer.
Apart from anything else, this is an insult to the English and even
more so to the Scots. Has any other country even been given such an
abject reason for suggesting that it should not advance towards the
democratic control of its affairs?
Has it not occurred to Sir Alick that the sales of Scottish and
Newcastle beers are much more likely to be damaged by the news that
their customers are making an involuntary contribution to the funds of
the Tory Party?

SINCE 1981 the Conservatives have sold nearly half a million acres of
our public woodlands with massive loss of public access. Once the land
is privatised there is no guarantee of good conservation management.
In July 1994, after a public outcry against the sell-off, the
Government deceived the public by stating: ''The Forestry Commission
woodlands should remain in the public sector.''
Two-hundred-and-three of our FC woodlands (53 in Scotland, the largest
being Scoor and Beach in Strathclyde -- 3337 acres) totalling 28,000
acres were privatised last year. For the first half of this year a
further 20,000 acres have been on the market.
Our public woodlands are currently being advertised as ''Government
Surplus Land''. In fact, of course, it's this socially and ecologically
destructive Government which is surplus, not our land.

HAVING been fortunate enough to see the magnificent film, Braveheart,
in Canada some months ago I must disagree wholeheartedly with your
critic, William Russell (September 4).
As a piece of modern cinema, Braveheart is a brilliant movie full of
action, wide-ranging emotions, and beautiful scenery. In addition Mel
Gibson's accent is as good as we'll ever get from a non-Scot.
Of course, there are historical inaccuracies but the main theme of
Wallace, the true patriot, shines through and will convey to many,
important untaught knowledge of our greatest hero.
William Russell in contrast appears to believe that the term critic
means you have to criticise and never praise. What a pathetic stance
from a nit-picking writer.
The proof of the puddin', of course, will be when the overwhelming
majority of Scots find Braveheart thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable.
Hopefully Mel Gibson will ignore the odd carper and return to make
subsequent films in Scotland.

he at tha same film that I, along with another 700, saw on Sunday night?
No-one expects 100% historical accuracy. What we all saw was a
magnificent epic, superb acting, a first-class storyline, and a splendid
setting. It is not too long. I am not the most frequent filmgoer but for
me the three hours passed so quickly.
Don't listen to William Russell's baloney -- go and see a first-class
action film.

ONE could feel the premeditated glee in William Russell's diatribe on
Braveheart (September 3) -- an intellectual among all the silly
proletariat who know no better than to enjoy such rubbish!
Shame on him. What a sour, carping criticism when all around were
obviously relishing the fun. Authentic or not, the film is going to be a
big success for Scotland, Scottish film-making, and tourism.
If he wants to get down to hard facts, he managed to get a few of them
wrong himself. The church in Lanark to which he alludes -- ''in which
Wallace wed'' -- is now a small ruin well back from the main street and
not the large stone edifice referred to, erected much later.
It has also been established that, contrary to popular belief,
Ellerslie in Ayrshire is more likely to have been Wallace's birthplace
than Elderslie.
Perhaps William Russell should read James Mackay's Brave Heart, one of
the most authoritative books on this fascinating man, as he brings
together all the known facts in a concise, unromanticised manner.
That said, surely film-making can be allowed some licence with the
facts in the interests of entertainment.

SORRY to poop on Mel's party, but William Wallace was Welsh, not
Scottish. At least that is the claim made in a book held in no less a
Scottish institution than the Clydesdale District Council library in
Lanark.
In A History of Scotland by Rosalind Mitchison, published by
Routledge, is contained the outrageous suggestion: ''In the ninth
century there were also British or Welsh tribes in the south of
Scotland, still holding a line of principalities from the outskirts of
modern Edinburgh to Carlisle. The British strain in Scotland was later
to produce one of the country's greatest heroes, William Wallace, whose
name means 'The Welshman' and whose family came from Wales.''
William Wallace a Welshman? What next? Alex Salmond a secret Tartan
Tory? Brian Meek a red-blooded Socialist? Or Michael Forsyth actually
coming up with serious incentives to encourage film-makers, not just of
the Hollywood variety, to invest in Scotland?

ARE there no depths the Unionist parties in Scotland won't sink to?
Have they no shame or embarrassment? They turned the premiere of
Braveheart in Stirling into a farce, a betrayal of all that William
Wallace fought and died for so long ago.
Why did Michael Forsyth, George Robertson, and others of the Unionist
cause bother turning up? They represent the British State. They work to
prevent the Scottish nation from regaining its freedom by constantly
indulging in scare tactics, attempting to strike fear into the Scottish
people.
In addition Unionist Labour has an appalling record of conning the
Scots by promising various types of Scottish parliaments but never
delivering.
Wallace has always lived in the minds of ordinary Scots, in spite of a
thorough attempt by the British State to eradicate Scottish history and
supplant it with a phoney British/English past.
We in the SNP who are the custodians of the modern-day struggle for
Scottish freedom, just as Wallace was in his day, have every right to
take inspiration from his heroic efforts to free his country in the only
way available in his time.
The Unionists are obviously afraid that Braveheart might attract more
Scots into the ranks of the SNP and eventually threaten their hold on
the levers of power.
Surely it must have been the free booze and high-powered knees-up that
attracted them and not any desire to pick up the cry of freedom and cast
aside Mother England's Union Jack.
Whatever else we may dispute in Scottish politics, let us have no more
of this type of hypocrisy. The Unionists are today's tartan traitors.
They should at least do the decent thing and stop taking Wallace's name
in vain.
Scottish freedom will eventually come when our people see through the
sham of the tartan Uncle Toms and rather than having to die like
Wallace, they can put aside their faint-hearts and vote for Scottish
independence.

I RECENTLY visited the birthplace of William Wallace in Elderslie,
Renfrewshire, and was very disappointed indeed to find it in a very sad
state. The monument panels have been vandalised by graffiti, and the
surrounding area is littered with papers, bottles, etc.
Considering the current interest in Wallace, due to the film
Braveheart, surely the tourist industry in Scotland could bring pressure
to bear on the appropriate authority to make this monument a place of
pilgrimage for Scots. At present it is a public disgrace.

CONCERNING the bridge to Bute, the solution instead is a ferry service
between Ardyne Point and Port Bannantyne (a 10-minute crossing).
This would link Bute with the much later ferry services run by Western

As I understand it, Western Ferries have tried for some time to get

THE improvement in the health of the people of Scotland is welcome,
especially as we have become gloomily familiar with news of a different
sort. Infant and neonatal mortality rates have improved, life expectancy
at birth has been raised, and heart attack rates are lower. Good health
education and information is responsible for much of this, although some
credit must be given to advances in medical care. Nevertheless, if
health advice and good information have been sufficient to persuade some
people to alter their diet or way of life, why have they not succeeded
with others? Figures for cot deaths have fallen dramatically through
health education programmes, and much the same can be said for the
successes achieved through needle exchange schemes and other health
promotions in lowering the rate of HIV infections contracted through
intravenous drug use. Deaths under the age of 65 from heart attacks are
lower and this is likely to be linked to changes in diet and lifestyle
by significant sections of the population. If this continues the target
of a 40% reduction in heart disease deaths by the year 2000 may be
attainable, however unlikely it may have looked in 1990.
Unfortunately, not all people seem willing to absorb good advice.
Cancer death rates in men fell in 1994 but rose slightly for women. This
sex difference is probably because men have reduced their smoking in the
past 20 years while women have not done so. Similarly, drug misuse is
increasing and is now common throughout the country. Both of these
latter problems have been addressed by health promotion campaigns. It
seems obvious that clear information on the damage caused by smoking and
drug-taking should have an effect on women and youngsters, but it does
not.
The message is surely that health education programmes are the best
way to persuade people to change their ways, but that devising the most
effective educational promotion is difficult. Research into this complex
area is needed and this will inevitably involve finance. The evidence of
the successful educational activities is that it will be money well
spent.

BRITISH GAS is maintaining its reputation for getting things wrong,
certainly in public relations terms. Its latest proposed 10% increase in
the cost of servicing central heating systems annually has raised a
storm of protest because of its size, three times the present rate of
inflation. The service has been costing more than its prices, according
to the company, and the move is partly a corrective, although it is also
designed to meet the cost of new investment in improvements. It seems a
ham-fisted move, exposing the company's management to criticism on two
counts, first, in letting such a position develop, and secondly, in
moving to change things at one go.
Some customers will find such an increase unaffordable, others will
resent its extent strongly. Many in both categories will be tempted to
switch to smaller independent operators in the field where there is
often competition. Some users of gas central heating systems will simply
economise, and avoid the annual inspection of their installation, for
which the British Gas service agreement provides. They might switch to
biennial inspections. Some could simply stop until a specific fault
develops. In each case they will be compromising their own safety. In
choosing cheaper, smaller operators they could be doing the same, for
British Gas has built up a solid reputation for safe and skilled work in
this area. Many good and reputable competitors do exist, but British Gas
was able to profit from its outstanding ''brand image'' for safety in
this business, and the way it had to protect it.
For these reasons the public reaction should have been anticipated by
the British Gas management which might then have staggered any increase
over two or three years. As it is, the announcement seemed designed to
provoke the maximum discontent among consumers: it is a marketing man's
nightmare. The company, which reports second quarter results this week,
has had a difficult time of late (much of its own making) but one
prediction for its future is that whenever domestic customers are free
to change their supplier they will desert British Gas in droves.

WHEN my grandfather told me the names of everyone from the town who
had helped Bruce's men recapture Linlithgow Palace it didn't occur to me
to ask him for his historical sources. When he took me to where Edward
camped his army on the night before the battle of Falkirk I didn't
quibble over which field was which.
He told me tales from his knee as generations of grandfathers had done
to generations of grandsons. I never did find out whether his sources
were Walter Scott, blind Harry, or hundreds of years of local and oral
tradition. I am sure that it doesn't matter one whit. The fire that he
lit still burns.
I found schooling in Scotland a ''Wallace-free zone'', although I
recall colliding with a bit of Bruce at primary school via Scots Wha
Hae. In sixth-year studies at Linlithgow Academy I could (but didn't)
have taken the Wars of Independence as an optional subject for a
dissertation, a choice that was available to the remaining four of my
classmates still studying history out of a primary school intake of some
150.
When I went to St Andrews University I was taught English
constitutional history masquerading as British history, but by some
manipulation of the timetable managed to study the independence struggle
as an option in my honours year under Geoffrey Barrow, the historian who
has perhaps more than any other raised the quality of interpretation of
the period.
Perhaps in the intervening quarter century things have improved in the
schools, although I doubt it. They have to be fair at St Andrews, which
now boasts a school of Scottish studies.
But overall the education system has failed to maintain the continuity
of what centuries of oral and popular tradition had safeguarded for all
Scots. And therefore we should hang our heads in shame when Randall
Wallace, the author of Braveheart, tells of how he met young Scots in
the shadow of the Wallace monument and they had no idea of who the
monument commemorated. This was a monument, remember, built by public
subscription last century when the opening was attended by tens of
thousands of people.
And that is why the experts who have split historical hairs with
Braveheart start in rather a poor position. Randall Wallace has written
a work of drama, not of history, and that is a perfectly legitimate
thing to do. Macbeth, after all, was a pretty decent king by most
accounts, rather than the Shakespearean usurper.
The film, however, captures the essence of the Wallace story. And in
so doing, Randall Wallace and Mel Gibson have given us back a part of
our history and of ourselves that was in danger of dying despite the
commendable efforts of some fine historians, the Wallace Society, Nigel
Tranter, and everyone else who has cared enough to tell this tale. It is
a reasonable bet that within weeks the name and fame of William Wallace
will be back on the lips of every youngster, not just in the shadow of
the monument but in Scotland and internationally.
The film itself is much, much better than we had any right to expect
from Hollywood history. In among all the blood and guts is both humour
and an extraordinary emotional power helped by some fine acting
performances. Critics who were not moved at the premiere must be dead
from the heart up.
It even manages to get some of the key messages spot on. For example
that Wallace's central problem in sustaining independence was not the
English but many of the leaders of Scottish society who have been
selling us short for centuries and still are. Among the VIPs at the
premiere there might, who knows, have been more than a few guilty
consciences, in sharp contrast to the enthusiastic crowds outside.
Nor should we accept from anyone that our history or our heroes are
second rate. The Unionist historian Alan Massie tells us that Scots
should be careful of Wallace because he had blood on his hands. This
unusual qualification for being a hero clearly does not extend to great
Brits such as Wellington, Wolfe, or Nelson, although the causes for
which they fought were somewhat more equivocal than that of Wallace.
I would plead guilty to the SNP hijacking Mel's photo and thought his
description of it as a ''bit cheeky'' to be just about right. But this
imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.
However, as to hijacking William Wallace, as claimed by our political
opponents, then let their words speak for themselves. George Robertson
talks of Wallace fighting for Scottish ''identity''. And then there is
Michael Forsyth, the only person to provoke a bigger reaction from the
Stirling crowds than Mel Gibson, albeit in entirely the opposite
direction.
Michael speaks of Wallace standing up for Scottish ''interests''.
Significantly both Unionist politicians found ''i'' words short of the
independence that Wallace was actually fighting for -- as evinced by his
actions, his own words, and by the accounts of every subsequent source.
Perhaps it was just the afterglow of the film, but I got the distinct
impression that both George and Michael looked a shade uncomfortable on
Sunday night. As well they might, because for three hours they had been
in the re-created presence of a man of whom the sixteenth-century
Scottish historian, George Buchanan, wrote:
''He stood alone, unsubdued and free, and neither could awards induce
nor terrors force him to desert the public cause which he had once
undertaken and his death was the more grievous because, unconquered by
his enemies he fell, betrayed by those from whom it was least to be
expected.''

IT IS impossible to have a summit on the Northern Ireland peace
process if the negotiating table is to be infested by ghosts from the
past. Like malignant ectoplasm, the attitudes and prejudices which have
bedevilled Irish history for generations wove themselves between the
sinews of the formula which the British and Irish governments were
attempting to build for today's planned summit. Inevitably it collapsed.
The British Government knows well that Ulster Unionists will not join
talks with Sinn Fein until there is clear and indisputable proof that
the IRA will not resort to arms once more. This proof can only
reasonably be discerned in the progressive abandonment of arms. The
Irish government is just as aware that the IRA will not abandon as much
as a bullet until it has an unconditional entry into all-party talks,
and perhaps not even then. In these cicumstances it is perhaps as well
that the summit has been postponed, for to meet and then to fail might
have been more embarrassing than the present situation. Nevertheless, it
is a difficult position in which the two governments find themselves. Mr
Major and the British negotiators could be forgiven for feeling
aggrieved this morning. Most of the concessions which have been made in
recent months have come from the British side. It is only reasonable
that clear and tangible proof be furnished of the abandonment of weapons
over a period of time if peace talks are to go ahead. Yet Britain is
continually asked to go further, and criticised internationally for not
doing so yet again.
Ironically, there is agreement that an international commission
chaired by Mr George Michael on the question of arms would be a good way
to proceed, yet even here differences have emerged. The Irish, clearly
nervous of IRA reaction, want terms of reference for the commission
which would deal with principles and perhaps a declaration of intent,
while the British position is that the commission should discuss a
concrete process of abandonment of arms. A commission as a mere talking
shop, or as a method of twin-tracking to oblivion the question of arms,
would not be helpful. In these circumstances the question of a firm date
for all-party talks is difficult to envisage. Somehow a way must be
found around this deadlock. Let the IRA, so cynical in other respects,
surrender some mouldy Semtex and let the British Government offer a date
for talks. If cynicism is the only way to banish the ghosts, so be it.

Falkirk temple is just one of around 580 buildings across Scotland
taking part in Doors Open Day over the next couple of weeks. Craig
Watson describes the growing popularity of the event
THE mysteries of the Masonic Order were always considered secure
behind the heavy wooden doors of the unobtrusive building in Falkirk
town centre.
Passers-by wouldn't give the plain doorway, flanked by sturdy pillars,
a second glance. But the Masonic temple in Lint Riggs is unique in the
region and one of only a small number in Scotland.
An inscription on the door reads ''Lodge Callendar 588'' and a close
look at the first-floor level, above a bookmakers and several shops,
shows five decorative stained-glass windows. Inside lies the history of
the order dating back to 1876.
The activities of the lodge are shrouded in secrecy. But now the
organisation is among an increasing number opening its doors to the
general public.
The Falkirk temple is just one of about 580 buildings across Scotland
taking part in Doors Open Day during the next couple of weeks.
The event, part of the annual European Heritage Days programme
involving more than 20 countries, is now in its sixth year in Scotland.
It was established in Glasgow during the city of culture year in 1990
and has since spread to 23 other Scottish areas.
Organisers say it allows access to a vast range of historic and modern
buildings which would normally be difficult to explore. The fact that
Masonic temples in Falkirk and Aberdeen -- seen by the public as
adopting the ultimate closed-door policy -- are taking part illustrates
the growing popularity of the event.
A member of the Falkirk order explained that the temple, which opened
in 1906 after a two-year building programme, differed from most Lodges
because it was a detailed copy of the biblical temple of King Solomon.
The large interior is fronted by a raised platform and lectern. Above,
the all-seeing eye stares down at a large Bible placed on a special
ledge. Around the ceiling are symbols of the moon, the stars, the sun,
and tools of trades and crafts.
''It's part of the town, and Doors Open Day is for buildings of
historic importance,'' the member said. ''This is the second year we've
taken part and last year it went very well. History is not everyone's
favourite subject but we have been pleased and surprised by the
response.''
Mr Ian Scott, chairman of the Falkirk Local History Society, helped
organise the town's open day. Last year he conducted tours around the
temple.
He said: ''I was tremendously impressed by the building. The sheer
historical power of the organisation is of interest because of the money
and influence involved. People have been very surprised to find this in
their midst.''
The organiser of the Glasgow event, Liz Davidson, said it was expected
to be a big success. Davidson, director of the Glasgow Building
Preservation Trust, said up to 100,000 publicity leaflets would be
distributed.
She added: ''There are 90 buildings taking part in Glasgow, making it
easily the largest in Scotland and the biggest event we've ever done.
Interest has been quite extraordinary -- it has obviously grown in
popularity a lot. Attendances are up 10% every year.
''This year we are trying to do a lot more modern buildings and have
the architects on hand to give talks.''
She said interesting buildings included The Herald office in Albion
Street, the ''gory'' police museum in Pitt Street (described as ''not
entirely suitable for children under 14''), and even the sewage pumping
station in Partick.
But there were signs that the event could become increasingly
political. There is an annual attempt to persuade Rangers to forgo
commercial opportunities and open up Ibrox, so far without success. Yet
rivals Celtic have, in the past, opened the doors at Parkhead to allow
fans a taste of Paradise. And forward-thinking interested parties have
already suggested that all the buildings along the route of the proposed
M74 should be opened up before the controversial motorway is built.
And the event, although widely praised, is not without its critics.
Ken Andrew, of Prestwick, has accused national organisers of leaving
Ayrshire out in the cold because of a bureaucratic mix-up. He claims it
was agreed well in advance that the Ayrshire open day would take place
on September 3.
Local organisers prepared for the big day and drew up publicity
material with last Sunday's date. Later, the national event was set for
this Saturday and Sunday and the following weekend -- and Historic
Scotland said they could not allow Ayrshire to be included in the
official arrangements because the Council of Europe allowed a maximum of
only four days.
Andrew said: ''Ayrshire has been left as an unofficial participant
this year through no fault of its own, and as a poor reward for its
speedy efficiency in pre-planning long before Historic Scotland came
round to considering the details. We are the victims of an
over-bureaucratic system.
''This is a terrific event but it should all be sorted out well in
advance next year.''
A spokeswoman for Historic Scotland said the organisation was simply
carrying out publicity work on behalf of the European organisers.
John Hume, chief inspector of historic buildings for Historic
Scotland, said the emphasis should be on the variety of fascinating
buildings.
He said: ''There's a very good selection of buildings this year --
probably the best yet.''
He said some of the more memorable buildings included Alexander Greek
Thomson's house at Holmwood, Netherlee, in Glasgow -- closed to the
public for many years until it was acquired by the National Trust for
Scotland recently.
He added: ''This event gets bigger every year -- it is tremendously
popular. Last year there were queues right down the street outside some
of the Glasgow buildings and the same could happen again. It should be a
great success.''

Alan Masson argues that employers can avoid industrial tribunal
proceedings by taking advice before problems arise
AN unfortunate misconception prevails among some employers that an
industrial tribunal is a form of ''kangaroo court'', inherently
prejudiced against them. Usually, but not generally, they are managers
of small or medium-sized enterprises who have a fantastic approach to
staff and workforce relations, tending to affect their handling of
employee problems.
Too often, many of them plough ahead, regardless of the consequences,
and so fail to conduct matters affecting employees' interests with due
fairness, as is highlighted by a recent Labour Party report which
indicates that successful unfair-dismissal claims have risen by 50% in
what is described as the current ''hire and fire'' era.
Such employers live in the shadows of labour relations, where the
outdated concept of master and servant still lingers. However, changes
in employment law over the past few decades, much of it driven from
Europe, have sought to redress the balance between employer and employee
to some extent and, consequently, emphasise fairness in dealing with
issues of discipline, dismissal, and redundancy. Bias and discrimination
in respect of sex and race have been addressed. Yet, although it is
naive for an employer to assume that he or she has a free hand in the
treatment of employees, there are those who persist in that approach.
Increasingly onerous penalties are now imposed upon those who fail to
grasp that times have changed or who neglect to observe the multifarious
changes in the law. The introduction of the Sex Discrimination and Equal
Pay (Remedies) Regulations 1993 and the Race Relations (Remedies) Act
1994, removed the upper limit of compensation which can be awarded by an
industrial tribunal in sex or race discrimination cases, thereby
increasing the risk to the erring employer.
That risk may be set to increase dramatically following the recent
decision of the English Court of Appeal that the two-year qualifying
period of continuous employment for the purposes of bringing industrial
tribunal proceedings is itself discriminatory against women and cannot
be justified. While the decision is to be appealed, the position remains
that it is likely that the qualifying period for bringing tribunal
applications will fall to one year.
The awards made to former members of the armed forces in recent cases
against the Ministry of Defence should have signalled to employers the
risks they run (albeit that some cases were special and the awards are
unlikely to be repeated).
Industrial tribunal statistics show that, in 1993/94, the median award
for compensation in sex discrimination cases almost doubled. While over
the same period only one case qualified for an award of #8000 or more,
the following year saw 20 such cases reported. Evidence shows that,
without the statutory limits, awards are seven times greater than
previously -- if the substantial compensation awards obtained by some
Servicewomen are taken into account. Now, an employer charged with
sexual or racial discrimination may well face having to meet an award in
excess of the former ceiling of #17,150.
(Currently, that level of compensation remains in unfair dismissal
cases but will shortly rise to #17,600 with an increase in the statutory
limit on a nominal week's pay to #210. That limit is itself outdated and
likely to be challenged since there is pressure to bring compensation
for unfair dismissal into line with that awarded in cases of sex and
race discrimination.)
Accepting that, heedless of the consequences, employers' behaviour can
place them at serious financial risk, how can they protect themselves?
How can they be fairly represented at an industrial tribunal?
Take advice as soon as a problem manifests itself; don't wait until
the chips are down. By immediately adopting fair and reasonable
procedures, the employer will be better placed if challenged before a
tribunal.
Many businesses need education in the crisis management of employment
relations. If an organisation does not have the time, the skills, or
even the awareness to cope with the constraints which affect this
fundamental aspect of its affairs, these resources can be obtained
externally. Not the least of these is the solicitor who, while
specialising in employment law, readily understands a business and the
way it is run. By carrying out an employment audit, an experienced legal
adviser can reveal organisational deficiencies early enough to minimise
the risk of claims.
Why gallop into danger when, with a little foresight and planning, the
dangers can be identified and avoided? In 1993/94 there were 42,757
unfair dismissal claims. Of these, 15,249 were settled through Acas and
12,680 were withdrawn. Almost 6000 were successful at tribunal hearings,
the balance being dismissed or disposed of otherwise. It may be assumed
also that, in most Acas settlements, the employer had to pay some
compensation. Additionally, about a further 27,000 claims were raised
under other aspects of protective legislation.
So, industrial tribunals are busy places. Cases take longer than one
day to resolve. The cost of representation is not cheap. The drain on
management time in preparing and presenting a defence at a tribunal can
be heavy -- a hidden but nevertheless material cost. Employers should
bear in mind that the cheque, signed to pay an award, acknowledges work
undone, opportunities missed, and self-inflicted damage. With foresight
and appropriate advice such conflict can be avoided.

THERE was at least one gross logical absurdity uttered by Tony Blair
in his interview yesterday with Radio Scotland, while he sought to
reassure us on Labour's commitment to devolution. It was an absurdity so
gross as to make me wonder whether he has understood, or at all thought
about, where he stands after his party's recent twists and turns.
It came when he was pinned down on a future Scottish parliament's
taxing powers. He scarcely bothered to argue with the interviewer's
contention that, under the latest ideas bruited about Labour, the
present system of financing public expenditure in Scotland would in all
essentials continue. That is to say, it would be done by means of a
block grant voted at Westminster. There would have been no point in
arguing with this contention because it is as a matter of fact true,
even if denied by George Robertson and others.
But, Blair maintained, there would still be some ''small amount of
leeway'', to assure a measure of fiscal responsibility by the Scottish
parliament. This is the famous power to vary income tax up or down by
3%.
Asked then what would happen if the Scottish parliament exercised its
option to cut income tax, and whether Westminster might as a result take
money away from Scotland, in other words reduce the block grant, Blair
firmly answered no. By way of explanation, he offered the analogy of
local government. Every authority gets most of its revenue through an
annual grant from the Exchequer. Every authority also charges a council
tax on top. But pitching it high or low, or varying it from one year to
the next, makes no difference to the grant. If mere local government can
be entrusted with this degree of responsibility, said Blair, then how
much more can a future national government in Scotland.
His analogy is false. Under the system of financing public expenditure
in Scotland which his party apparently now plans, there is no equivalent
of local government's central grant plus council tax, the one fixed, the
other variable. There is, in effect, only central grant.
Here I must bring in, and apologise for doing so, the controversy of
the past few weeks over assigned revenues for the Scottish parliament.
Arcane it may be but, once the layers of jargon are peeled off, it takes
us straight to the heart of Labour's true attitudes to devolution and of
their bogus nature.
To assign revenues, in this case the whole or a large share of income
tax and value added tax, means to make them in some sense the Scottish
parliament's own. While the taxes might be collected through the
existing channels, the Inland Revenue and the Customs and Excise of the
United Kingdom, they would by definition belong to Scotland.
There could be no haggling every year with Westminster over at least
that part of the Scottish revenue, and no chance for English MPs to
squeeze it, with all the trouble and tension which must surely result.
Arguments would doubtless go on about whatever degree of equalisation
was deemed necessary to top up the revenue and cover the expenditure
planned in Scotland. But this would be a different, and lesser, matter.
If revenues are assigned, it seems obvious that they can be varied up
or down by 3%, or in principle by any other percentage. If the Scottish
parliament raises tax by 3%, it gets that much more revenue. If it cuts
tax by 3%, it gets that much less revenue. Scots MPs would have to
decide for themselves, and account for their action to the voters. This
is what you call responsibility.
But what happens if the revenues are not assigned, if instead there is
an ''assigned budget'', in other words, a central or block grant voted
at Westminster? Then, it seems just as obvious, there will be little or
nothing for the Scottish parliament to decide. Unlike even local
councils, it would be getting no fixed grant plus variable tax, but only
fixed grant. Of course an arrangement can be made for the Scots MPs to
raise a small supplement, to put an extra penny on the tax for education
or some other worthy purpose. Why should they, though, under the scheme
outlined by Blair in his interview?
What he said, after all, was that if they cut the tax then this would
make no difference to the block grant handed down from Westminster.
Here is the gross logical absurdity, and the political outrage
besides. An upward change in the Scottish rate of taxation increases
Scottish revenue, but a downward change has no effect whatever.
This is certainly what you call irresponsibility. In such
circumstances, which Scottish Cabinet is going to miss the chance to cut
the tax by 3%, and for good measure to hold it at 3% below the English
rate of income tax in all time coming? In a sense it is the eternal
Scottish dream: screw the English, and keep the money. It may sound a
grand idea to us, but somehow I do not thnk it will go down too well
south of the Border.
So far, then, from having cleared up doubts over devolution, Blair has
made his plans even messier, and thus more impractical, than before. I
have always believed the tax-raising powers he proposes for the Scottish
parliament to be unusable. Higher tax, the tartan tax, is obviously a
loser. Lower tax in the form he sets out will have the English up in
arms, and quite right too. It is almost kinder to conclude that he just
does not know what he is talking about, that it is all just blether,
soothing noises to catch votes.

THE gloves are off boys. You asked for it. In fact, you practically
begged for it. The sexist backlash is upon you and you lot deserve every
last innuendo-laden comment. For years women have had to listen to men
commenting upon their appearance, and not only from the chaps on the
building sites with their ''cor, luv-a-duck'' wolf whistles but also
from business colleagues old enough to know better (with an emphasis on
old), sports commentators who think it's a-OK scathingly to remark on
the physique of female athletes, and the kind of newspapers which
witheringly bluster about the homely appearance of Kenneth Clarke's
wife. That'll be Kenneth Clarke, sex god of Parliament, hmm?
Well take cover 'cos we're taking up your weapons and using them
against you -- and a quick glance in the mirror will convince you that
we have ammunition aplenty. Be warned; if the women in your workplace
are gathered together and sniggering it's not about their horoscopes.
It's over your polyester suit, paunch or truly pathetic tie. No longer
will we submit to the gruesome sight of you parading yourselves in
shorts during the summer months. From now on, when you stroll down the
street, arrogantly unaware of your deficiencies in the thigh muscle
department, be prepared to be greeted by cries of ''nice face, shame
about the legs!''
Because if you shower can bleat on about plastic Pamela Anderson and
the bits of her anatomy that few of us can ever attain -- or should that
be afford? -- then we shall rave about hunks, finding you sadly wanting
in the Adonis department. And you won't like it, not one little bit.
We hoped it wouldn't come to this, truly we did. In an ideal world we
would all judge one another on fairer terms than that of physical
perfection, and for a little while, in the halcyon politically correct
era of the 80s, when women were emboldened by their assertiveness
training courses and when men, reckoning that the only way they would
ever get their Nat King Cole was to emulate a psychological makeover,
put on a mask in front of women, pretending that they were deeply
sensitive souls who agreed with every dot and comma of The Beauty Myth
and who were deeply disgusted by any sexist comment uttered by the old
guard of chauvinist pigs. They were a new breed, the little porkers
assured us, and we fell for their New-Man rot hook, line, and sinker.
And were duly sunk.
Then they all got bored with the effort of this charade, the style
mags announced the birth of the New Lad, and men, with a mass sigh of
relief, took off their New-Men masks and chucked them in the bin and
regressed into banter about booze and birds, believing that this time
around it was sanctioned by the saving grace of ''ironic detachment''.
Cobblers.
Leering with even more enthusiasm and chauvinism than that of the
generation before, they had forgotten that this generation of women has
more balls. If we sat back and listened with an indulgent smile, if we
flicked through the pages of Viz and loaded with them it was only to
lull them into a false sense of security.
Silly boys -- you forgot that a lifetime of oppression and simmering
in the background has made us so much sharper than you, our
sociopolitical skills are much subtler, and we're smarter at the act of
subversion; our backlash was duly unleashed.
So, when the men abandoned the nappy-changing classes in favour of a
return to footie duty we duly trooped along to the terraces with them.
After decades spent puzzling over the fascination of watching 22 men
kicking a football around, the penny finally dropped. Forget the ball,
watch the bods. Drool over all those athletic physiques. ''Ooh, aah,
Cantona,'' indeed. And there was even more bulk to be found on the rugby
fields. Scores of women suddenly developed a keen interest in the fate
of the Five Nations.
This year, during the battle between Scotland and France, the
inhabitants of a pub in Elie were dismayed to have to listen to me and
my mates slavering (I use the word advisedly) over our favoured hunks.
There is nothing more calculated to crack male bonding than sitting in
on their televisual appreciation of a sporting activity and interrupting
it with shrieks of, ''Look at the buns on him! Tasty!'' at crucial
moments. Ah, the sweet taste of revenge.
All those theories about the cult of the Chippendales signifying an
expression of dormant female sexuality are way off mark. We really buy
the tickets and pin up the calendars to give men a taste of their own
medicine . . . a treatment which admittedly has some pleasing side
effects for us. Pass the Kleenex.
Men are starting to find out what it's like to be on the end of an
objectifying gaze. The country's annual beauty pageant was staged last
week but no-one was interested in the statistics, vital or otherwise, of
Miss United Kingdom. Nope, the cameras were all trained on the winner of
Mr UK, and the judge interviewed was not the usual seedy George Best
clone but Barbara Windsor, a proponent of the delights of toy boys, who
in characteristically saucy style declared that while it was a hard
choice the winning lad would be ''ooh, er, whoever catches your eye''.
In July a male writer in the magazine New Women whined that one of the
things men hated about women was their increasing habit of making sexist
comments: ''Whereas most men now think twice about dismissing women as
bimbos, the reverse doesn't seem to apply -- as men are often shocked to
discover.'' Too true, Jon Courteney Grimwood -- wonder what you made of
an article in the glossy Company, which ran a feature in its August
issue explaining Why We Love Himbos. Which is tame compared with this
month's coverline for the raunchy More! magazine -- Show Us Your
Hosepipe, a feature about ''hot and horny'' firemen.
MEN detest hearing themselves discussed in the kind of sexist language
they unthinkingly use themselves, I recently mused during a telephone
call. No we don't, my male friend countered. Yes you do, I insisted. No
we don't, he laughed insistingly. Well, what about when we talk about
size, and I ain't talking body weight, I cunningly parried. He audibly
gulped. ''I've got to go now,'' he said shortly. And hung up.
You all might live to regret the day you invented the New Lad chant of
''get your tits out for the boys''. Like I mentioned, the gloves are
off. We're sparing your egos no longer. We've no qualms about hitting
below the belt. And boy, can we pack a powerful punch.

THIS is back to school time in America, and with President and
Congress back in town, everyone is confidently predicting a train-wreck
in November. That is when the government will run out of money unless
President Clinton and Congress can agree on spending priorities.
The Republicans in the House of Representatives have passed a number
of money Bills that include cuts in spending, and social and
environmental policy changes that President Clinton has promised to
veto. If the Bills get through the Senate and the President carries out
his threat, there will be no money in the kitty to pay for the
government.
In a spirit of compromise, the political issue could be settled until
the next election. But there is no spirit of compromise, partly because
there is to be an election. There's more: the size of the national debt
is set by law, which means that once a year Congress has to pass a new
law raising it. The present limit is $4.9 trillion and government
borrowing will hit that figure at the end of October.
If the conflict between President and Congress is not settled,
Republicans are threatening to refuse to raise the limit. That would
mean that the government would not be able to pay $26bn in interest due
on November 15. It would then default -- and just imagine what that
would do to the world economy.
No-one believes it will come to that, but then again no-one is quite
certain. We assume that the ideologues in Congress can be brought to
swallow their principles and raise the debt ceiling even if the
President refuses to accept their fiscal and social agenda -- but we're
not absolutely sure.
Meanwhile, Congress is going to be tied up with a number of noisy and
secondary matters. Here's a measure of the state of American politics:
Senator Bob Dole, leading candidate for the Republican presidential
nomination, and party leader in the Senate, is so worried about the
ultra-conservative wing of the party that he has promised to make a top
priority out of passing a constitutional amendment against flag-burning,
and laws to make English the national language and banning affirmative
action. He also wants to revive the proposed balanced-budget amendment.
These things will keep Congress tied in knots -- and prevent serious
debate on welfare reform, budget reform, reform of the Medicare and
Medicaid systems (the two programmes that cause most of that inexorable
increase in the national debt), and all the other serious items that
confront the nation.
When Senator Dole is reduced to supporting a nonsense like this, you
know he is losing control.
As for the fiscal question, which really is important, Senator Dole's
rivals, including Senator Phil Gramm, believe there are votes to be won
by bringing the government to its knees. Senator Gramm promises to
balance the budget, come what may, and a good, though drastic, way to
start is to forbid it to borrow any more money.
What it all adds up to is the possibility that the Republicans, who
won control of Congress in November 1994, are going to blow it in 1995.
It does not mean they will lose Congress next year, but it does mean
that the public, which is expected a sweeping reformation and an
immediate return to the good times, is going to be very disappointed.
It would be most unfair to blame the Republicans for not achieving
everything they promised in six months, provided they continued
single-mindedly to work through the main items of their election
platform. It would be altogether fair to blame them if they allowed
themselves to be side-tracked into ultra-conservative absurdities.
The President is all geared up to do just that. He blames grid-lock in
Washington on the Republicans, and it's quite persuasive. Newt Gingrich
and his cohorts have succeeded in persuading the country that they run
Washington, so of course they will get the blame for everything that
goes wrong and for everything they fail to accomplish.
Mr Clinton might even benefit from vetoing major spending Bills, and
defying Congress to close down the government. The environmental laws
are popular and so are the programmes the Republicans want to cut. The
White House has already prepared plans for shutting down everything
except the armed forces and the FBI.
The extremists might call his bluff, and let him shut it all down. Mr
Gingrich is pretty extreme himself, and if Mr Dole has not yet sold his
soul, he has at least drafted the contract, and initialled it.
It's a game of chicken, and the ultimate dare would be letting the
federal government default on its debts. They couldn't do that, could
they? Actually, they could.

I fear being used as a political football and, speaking as a football,
I have been kicked around quite enough
With the publication of his new novel, Salman Rushdie looks back over
his difficult years in Britain and discusses with William Russell the
echoes calling him to India
SEVEN years of fatwa and Salman Rushdie has a sense of ''some clouds
blowing away''. The author of The Satanic Verses, the cause of his
troubles, admitted it was a mystical remark, but he believed the change
in the atmosphere was the result of the publication of his acclaimed new
novel, The Moor's Last Sigh. The past had been put in the past.
''I am doing my job, which is much the best thing for a person to do,
and it is a matter of some satisfaction for me that I have been able to
do that,'' he said.
They had been difficult years. The most difficult thing in a
day-to-day sense had been the loss of spontaneity, not to be able to get
up and say one was going for a walk. It was a matter of saying one would
like to go for a walk, and then being told one could do so an hour
later, which was not the same thing if one was in the middle of a
writing day and simply wanted to clear one's head.
Some of his initial problems he blamed, not on the policemen guarding
him, but on people at the top, now retired, who were unsympathetic to
his plight. The restrictions he had been placed under were too extreme
and may even have been unnecessary, although one would never know, he
said. ''I try not to complain. It is difficult, but I have just made 48
and there was a time when I thought I would not reach my 42nd birthday.
It is a struggle, but I set myself the task at the very beginning of
getting my life back as swiftly as I could.
''But the issue in the Rushdie affair is not how good or bad my social
life would be. It is easy after all these years to lose the fact there
are important issues involved, not least the right of citizens to walk
around the streets without being attacked by a foreign power. One of the
attitudes very common among people who think about this issue is that
they believe there might be a lot of individual fanatics who would carry
the fatwa out.
''In my view there is some truth in that, but in this very long period
of time there has been no individual freelance activity. Given the
obscene amount of bounty money, there is no evidence of bounty hunters.
Everything is directly traceable to the actions of the Iranian state.''
One of the things he looked forward to doing was describing the
process by which someone went underground. ''England, Scotland, and
Wales are small countries and I have been in all of them,'' he said.
''Unlike the United States, which has many open spaces, it is not easy
to go underground here -- in the cities the people next door know, in
the villages everybody knows everything. The fact we have achieved this
for six and a half years obviously demands a great deal of skill and a
certain amount of luck and so far we have pulled it off.''
He has kept a diary and intends to write a book, not exactly an
autobiography, but equally not a work of fiction, about what he called
''these plague years''. The policemen guarding him had told him
everybody, the Foreign Secretary, the Northern Ireland Secretary, who
was obliged to have protection found it extremely difficult to cope
with, as did their families. It was the loss of privacy that hurt most.
He had done his best to lead as normal a life as possible because it
was important to show he was not a prisoner of the fatwa, that a foreign
power had not managed to jail him in his own country, that he was not
seen to be running scared, he said. There were important reasons to be
seen in public. The issue was not whether he could go to a book party,
but freedom of speech -- and the need to fight an attempt by a foreign
power to affect the working of British society. ''That is what it is
about, not whether I am a nice guy or have a good time,'' he added.
The book is set in South India, in Cochin, although he has not been
back to India since the fatwa. To say he missed the country was an
understatement, he said. ''It has been a gigantic loss for me, as a
person, let alone as a writer. Although I have not lived in India for a
long time (he has lived in Britain since 1965), I went there every year.
This is the longest period in my life I have been unable to visit the
sub-continent or Pakistan.
''One of the difficult things about writing The Moor's Last Sigh was
this was the first time I had a sense of writing from a position of
exile. Living in England and zooming back and forth there is no problem,
but when you cannot do so it changes your relationship with the place
and makes your need greater and more desperate. I was worried for a long
time whether I would be able to pull off this book.
''I was very conscious when writing it that unless it started to
become possible for me to come and go to India again it might be the
last novel about India I could write for a while. In that sense it is a
last sigh. The next one will not be about India, but, if we are here in
two or three years' time, and it is, you can remind me I said that.''
There was no reason for not returning to India. He did not imagine he
would be refused a visa, nor had he any fears about his personal safety.
The reaction to The Satanic Verses there had been unlike that in Iran.
''But I fear being used as a political football and, speaking as a
football, I have been kicked around quite enough,'' he added. ''Maybe
two or three extremist politicians would seek to use the occasion to
whip up demonstrations and I could not bear to return to that phase. I
would have to feel reasonably certain things like that would not happen,
but when I do I will be on the first plane.''
He conceded there were echoes of what had happened to him in the story
narrated by the Moor, Moraes Zogoiby, but he was not the Moor, although
all books came from things that had happened to the writer. If people
read some coded message into it about his own circumstances they would
be wrong.
Salman Rushdie first visited Kerala in the early 1980s when he was
very struck by the story of the Cochin Jews and the spice trade and
thought he would try to write a novel that grew out of a grain of
pepper. He had also wanted to write a love story. What intrigued him was
this one grain of pepper and the extent to which nothing that followed
-- Vasco da Gama, the British Empire -- would have happened without it.
''I would not be sitting talking to you now, certainly not talking in
English,'' he said. ''All this is the direct result of pepper. I knew
the Jews and Christians had both been very active in the spice trade and
I made a marriage between them to explain things thereafter. I thought
it would be good to try to make the whole density and immensity of
Indian culture grow out of the experiences of these tiny minorities.''
The book had been rapturously received in India, which pleased him. As
for how it will fare here, possibly some people would read it out of
curiosity, although he doubted whether anybody would read a 450-page
novel because they were curious about the peculiar life circumstances of
the author, he said. If they did, well and good.
''I may as well have the up side as the down side. I hope people will
read it because they like it. That would be the best possible reward.''

IT'S about time. After decades of controversy -- OK, tiny huffs --
over the lack of a suitable memorial to Robert Louis Balfour Stevenson
in the city of his birth, action is at last being taken.
True, there is nothing very wrong with Ian Hamilton Finlay's cute
little marker stone, tucked away as it is in a grove in Princes Street
Gardens. The thing is so thoroughly out of sight, however, that it is
also generally well out of mind. Alongside the monstrosity dedicated to
Walter Scott (otherwise known as ''Thunderbird III'') it doesn't really
cut the mustard.
Now, finally, a group of Stevensonians from both sides of the Atlantic
have put their heads together and come up with a commemorative wheeze of
which we feel Lou, as we long ago came to think of him, would have
approved.
The plan is to mount a plaque in the vicinity of Rutherford's bar in
Drummond Street. This might not seem like much of an idea, but given
that Rutherford's was one of the howfs the writer is known to have
frequented when he should have been wasting his time at the near-by
university, it seems entirely appropriate.
The Diary has no news yet of the precise wording planned for the
plaque, but the possibilities are endless. Something along the lines of
Robert Louis Stevenson Was Steaming Here has its appeal. Equally, Home
is the boozer, home from pubs/ and the tippler turfed from the bars
might do a turn.
We now look forward to other memorials to Lou's louche and legendary
youth, though the tourist authorities might not be too keen on plaques
marking the sites of long-gone Victorian brothels. Here Laid Robert
Louis Stevenson? Perhaps not.
Change of Hart
SOME of you, no doubt, have been impressed by the force of Foreign
Secretary Malcolm Rifkind's rapid reaction to the bombing of the Bosnian
Serbs. The man who, when Defence Secretary, informed the world that
air-strikes were in all circumstances a complete waste of time and
effort suddenly seems to have discovered the virtues of a ''robust''
response to Serb aggression.
Unkind souls might regard this as scant comfort to the Bosnians who
have suffered 41 months of genocide and British platitudes while Riffers
struggled to see sense. More worrying is the thought that throughout his
coma the Duddingston Daredevil enjoyed the unofficial and unpaid advice
of one Mr David Hart.
This property millionaire-cum-frothing Thatcherite scrambled to
prominence, you may remember, during the miners' strike as an
unofficial, unpaid etc go-between whose mission it was to help the UDM
understand that strikes were in all circumstances a complete waste of
time and effort. This he did, at least to his own satisfaction.
Quite how he then won the ear of Rifkind is something of a mystery.
Nevertheless, Hart is also known as a sincere enthusiast for the cause
of the blameless Serbs. It is further believed that he did not follow
Malky from the MoD to the Foreign Office. Hey, as they say in diplomatic
circles, presto.
Not totally tropical
IT IS, as you might expect, a very nice letter, and comes complete
with the noble crest of the University of Edinburgh. Still, it is not
exactly the sort of missive we are used to receiving in the moist depths
of the capital, even as ''the householder''.
''Dear Sir or Madame,'' writes Dr Gareth Edwards-Jones of the
Institute of Ecology and Resource Management, ''Research into tropical
rainforests.
''The University of Edinburgh is conducting research into people's
attitudes into (sic) tropical rainforests. As part of this work we would
like to talk to you, or one of your family, for about 10 minutes.''
This, it is safe to say, is a new one, tropical rainforests being a
little on the scarce side in these parts. Morningside might be a jungle,
but only in the queue at the post office is that fact obvious. True, we
have a damp course that perhaps needs a little attention, and a couple
of potted plants whose condition owes less to global warming than to
brutal neglect. Even so . . .
Dr Edwards-Jones is leaving nothing to chance, however. He goes on to
reassure us that the ''work is for research purposes only, and the
results will be kept entirely anonymous''.
Never fear, doc. We don't care who knows it: we're all in favour of
tropical rainforests, every last hot and sticky one of them. We are even
prepared to travel at short notice to the appropriate tropical beach at
the university's expense to discuss the matter further.
Now, ask us another.
On the march
BERWICK held its second annual military tattoo at the weekend and it
was, by all accounts, a lot of fun for the sort of people who like to
watch others marching up and down while attempting to play musical
instruments. Given that the event was in aid of the Soldiers', Sailors'
and Airmen's Families Association, however, we at the Diary will keep
our own opinions of such affairs to ourselves.
We couldn't help but notice, however, that the occasion attracted
several fine bands, including the Highland Band of the Scottish
Division, the Military Band of the Royal Scots (East Division) TA, the
Pipes and Drums of the Scottish Transport Regiment, the Pipes and Drums
of the King's Own Scottish Borderers, and so forth.
Given Berwick's location in the debateable lands, we feel obliged to
add that this act of homage to Scottish martial valour was organised by
English Heritage.
Awash with puns
THE East Lothian Courier has been unable to contain itself in its
coverage of the closure of North Berwick open air pool. Apparently there
has been a wave of protests. Not to be outdone, the East Lothian News
remarks that on its last open day the pool was flooded with customers.

A shell-shocked Bruton realised that he could not produce a formula
acceptable to an implacable
John Major
John Cooney describes the embarrassment caused by the postponement of
today's scheduled summit at Chequers
CAST in the uncomfortable role of the piggy in the middle between
Britain and Sinn Fein on the pivotal question of an IRA surrender of
some of its vast stock of arms and weapons, the Irish Government
yesterday played for more time at the trough. Once again at a critical
juncture in British-Ireland relations, ancestral instincts took a grip
of events as London championed the red, white, and gold of Ulster
Unionism, and Dublin played the green card.
Rather than risk a farmyard brawl of Orwellian proportions that would
seriously undermine the one-year-old IRA ceasefire, the Irish Government
moved to prevent a showdown by calling for the postponement of today's
scheduled summit at Chequers between premiers John Major and John
Bruton.
This dramatic and embarrassing retreat came after a lunch-time
telephone conversation between Major and Bruton during which the
Taoiseach failed to secure a commitment from the Prime Minister of a
target date for all-round talks among the political parties in Northern
Ireland.
With US President Bill Clinton due to visit the Irish Republic in late
November, Mr Bruton was pushing for political progress by that date.
However, according to diplomatic sources in Dublin, Mr Major refused
to make such a commitment until he had received a firm promise from Sinn
Fein that the IRA would begin the process of surrendering some of its
arms and explosives.
It was shortly after three o'clock yesterday afternoon when a
shell-shocked Bruton and his increasingly agitated Foreign Minister Dick
Spring realised that they could not produce the formula that would be
acceptable to an implacable John Major. Frantic consultations with John
Hume, the leader of Northern Ireland's Social Democratic and Labour
Party, and the Sinn Fein President, Gerry Adams, confirmed the engulfing
pessimism felt by Bruton and Spring that a postponement was necessary to
avoid a highly embarrassing diplomatic set-back to the fragile peace
process.
Dublin was caught in the middle between London's demands for the IRA
to begin the decommissioning process and Sinn Fein's equally
intransigent insistence that the IRA will not hand over one gun or a
single piece of Semtex ahead of an invitation to enter round-table
political talks unconditionally.
Although word of the postponement quickly swept Westminster and
Stormont around four o'clock, the Government spin-doctors in Dublin
refused to confirm the postponement. News bulletins on RTE, the Irish
national broadcasting network, continued to talk in speculative terms as
late as six o'clock.
Throughout a crisis-ridden day, Irish officials consulted with their
opposite numbers in London by telephone, and were making discreet
soundings with Sinn Fein leaders to guage whether the Republican
movement could make any concessions to ease the pre-summit tension.
And getting into the act -- if only by accident of his presence in
Dublin on an official visit -- was the Labour Leader, Tony Blair, who in
numerous media interviews backed John Major's demands for a move by the
IRA to begin the destruction of its vast arsenal of arms and explosives.
All of this took place against the backdrop of grim warnings from Sinn
Fein leaders, Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness, that they had no room
to manoeuvre.
Following Monday's inconclusive meeting between Mr Spring and the
Northern Ireland Secretary of State, the Irish Government was furious
that it had come out into the open that they had not yet agreed on the
terms of reference for an international commission to tackle the arms
issue.
The sudden frenetic mood of uncertainty in Dublin was in marked
contrast to the optimistic signals which Irish Government officials gave
journalists over the weekend. A flurry of leaks had predicted that
Bruton and Major had reached a private understanding on the arms issue.
It was left to Sir Patrick Mayhew to begin the process of disabusing
Dublin of this delusion.
Both Governments are agreed on the setting up of an international
commission, to be chaired by George Michael, President Clinton's special
adviser on Northern Ireland.
Dublin wants both Irish Republicans and Ulster Loyalists to give an
unequivocal pledge to the commission that they have renounced violence
as a method of securing a united Ireland or of keeping Northern Ireland
in the Union. Such a pledge would allow the former paramilitaries to
enter the democratic process.
However, this pledge failed to meet fully the three principles
announced last spring in Washington by Sir Patrick. Namely, that the IRA
and Loyalist paramilitaries subscribe to progressive decommissioning,
work out ways of dumping the arms, and make an immediate gesture by
destroying a specific quantity which lie hidden in the Republic as well
as in Northern Ireland.
Well aware that Ulster Unionists will not sit down with Sinn Fein
until they have proof of the IRA's abandonment of ''the armed
struggle'', Mr Bruton favours the first two principles. But he realised
that the third option of an arms surrender, no matter how cosmetic in
public relations, has no precedence in the history of Irish
Republicanism.
While Mr Bruton might like to see Sinn Fein make such a gesture, he
was hemmed-in by the outright refusal of Republicans to begin to destroy
weaponry ahead of their admission to talks.
Mr Bruton was sensitive to the gibe of ''John Unionist'' -- the term
of abuse hurled at him by Sinn Fein -- for his readiness to see the
Unionist viewpoint when he was leader of the Opposition. He knew that if
he failed to accommodate Sinn Fein, he would be castigated by
Republicans as the man who sold out the nationalist cause.
The moment of truth came when a crestfallen Bruton called off his
debut visit to Chequers.

DESPITE Eurotunnel's upbeat announcement yesterday, its business is
lagging a very long way behind the projections made in May last year,
when the company went for its last rights issue. At that time they
suggested that Le Shuttle would carry 8.9m passengers this year and
650,000 lorries. Even including the brighter figures for July and
August, current projections are for just 2.7m passengers and 370,000
lorries. The passenger figure is 70% below projection and freight 43%
below.
Eurotunnel point out that their original projections were accompanied
by a ''health warning'' and that delays and teething troubles have
thrown the figures off course. ''These figures were based on a projected
start for the tourist service in the autumn but it didn't begin until
December 22,'' said a spokeswoman. The official line is that things are
starting to come right in the past couple of months.
Some observers aren't so sure. Richard Hannah, transport analyst with
stockbrokers UBS, says: ''Whatever, they are saying today, the figures
are way behind the preliminary forecasts puts out by Eurotunnel just
over a year ago. They have also had to trim fares. Their first-half
results showed a turnover of #104m, instead of the #513m expected.''
Hannah predicts that another refinancing is in the offing:
''Eurotunnel's long-suffering shareholders should expect another knock
on the door in the near future.''
In the event of a vicious price war clearly Eurotunnel will be unable
to respond. They are banking on selling their service as a completely
different product. Yesterday their spokeswoman put it like this: ''It's
like the underground and the bus. If you want to enjoy the view and
don't mind traffic jams and windy bus shelters, you take the bus. If you
want to get there, you take the tube.'' The ferry companies might use a
different analogy.

Although it has failed to meet predicted figures for the year,
Eurotunnel is claiming a victory in the cross-Channel war. Anne
Johnstone examines the claims and counterclaims
EARLIER this year Eurotunnel warned that the summer would be
''make-or-break time'' for the #11bn Channel Tunnel. Well, it looks as
if they've made it -- but only just. A surge of passengers in July and
August has given the troubled company a vital boost.
Yesterday it announced that its Folkstone-Calais car-carrying Le
Shuttle trains carried 145,861 cars and 2728 coaches in August, an
increase of 30% on the July figure and 47% on June. At the same time its
two main competitors on the short-hop route, Stena Sealink and P&amp;O
European Ferries, admit that their car traffic is slightly down on last
year.
Eurotunnel was so delighted to have some good news for a change that
their ecstatic chief executive, Georges-Christian Chazot, exclaimed that
the figures confirmed ''our arrival in first place in the carrying of
private cars'' on the route.
This claim sent the faxes flying yesterday as P&amp;O tetchily retorted
that they were still ahead. ''We carried 176,590 vehicles on our
Dover-Calais service in August and even if you subtract caravans and
trailers, that still leaves 160,078 cars, so we don't know how
Eurotunnel can claim to have beaten us,'' said P&amp;O's spokeswoman in
Dover, Nicola McShane from Motherwell. Besides, she said, their
cumulative total of cars carried this year was still way ahead.
Undeterred, Eurotunnel's Allyson Andrews, bounced back with a claim
that their spies had been out counting caravans and campervans down at
the P&amp;O terminal and had totted up 11,000 over a 10-day period in
August. Ergo, P&amp;O must have carried at least 31,000 ''non-cars'' during
August and this should be deducted from the vehicles total. (Eurotunnel
doesn't officially carry caravans and the like until the end of this
month.) If you accept this logic, Eurotunnel beat its rival last month
by the princely total of 271 cars.
More significant and not in dispute is that Eurotunnel consolidated
its position in road freight during the summer, which is traditionally a
slack period for freight on the ferries. Stena have yet to issue figures
but P&amp;O were down around 20% on the previous month. It's also down on
last year. By contast, Eurotunnel carried almost as many lorries in
August as July. Yesterday the company was trumpeting that their share of
the freight market via Calais is now ''approaching 50%''.
Up to July the story had been very different. Last year there were
gloomy predictions about dramatic contractions on the short
cross-Channel ferry routes. Instead, Stena Sealink's passenger and
car-carrying volumes actually increased in the first half of this year.
The number of cars carried rose by 3%. P&amp;O figures showed only a
slight dip. During that period the Chunnel carried only 1.27 million
passengers, just 13%. Even freight, which the ferry companies frankly
expected to lose to Eurotunnel in large measure, increased slightly.
''We are delighted with the performance of our business which shows
market growth in all sectors despite the Channel Tunnel,'' said Gareth
Cooper, Stena Sealink MD.
So where is the Eurotunnel business coming from? There are probably
two answers, says Andrews of Eurotunnel. First, there are new
passengers, travelling via the Tunnel because of its novelty value.
Secondly, over recent years the Dover-Calais route has seen phenomenal
growth. Between 1984 and 1994 the number of passengers per year shot up
from 7,500,000 to nearly 19,000,000. The number of cars carried has more
than trebled. Coaches and freight have more than doubled. Each of the
past five years has seen a 20% growth in the market as a whole. The
market is now valued at #600m a year. The ferry companies now believe
they will hold or slightly improve on last year's figures. That means
that this year's growth is being absorbed by the new player in the
field.
Of course, turnover is vanity. Profit is reality and there isn't much
to be had for anyone on the Dover-Calais route this year. Eurotunnel is
struggling to cope with its #11bn construction costs. The ferry
companies are maintaining their volumes by some spectacular discounting.
Stena was offering 20% off advance bookings even in August.
From September 9 to October 31 an offer currently running in several
national newspapers invites readers to Channel-hop for the day for #15
per car, plus #5 per passenger. Stena's standard day trip this month is
#72 for a car and up to nine people.
From the end of this week P&amp;O will be charging #19 per car and #4 per
passenger for a day-return. Eurotunnel can't afford to play this game.
Their cheapest short-break return fare this month is #115 per car (#54
for a motorcycle).
The price war is likely to intensify next year. Yesterday, Stena
Sealink, which is dropping Sealink from its title, announced a major
expansion on the Dover-Calais route next year, with the introduction of
a fast ferry service. Stena Sea Lynx II, a giant catarmaran, will do the
trip in 45 minutes. It may not match Le Shuttle on convenience but it
will come close to matching it on speed.
Meanwhile, the French company, SNAT, which has operated the route
jointly with Stena up to now, will be launching an independent service
on the same route next year. Will there be enough passengers for all of
them and the Tunnel as well? Many have their doubts.
Meanwhile, there are likely to be bargains galore, with ferry
operators clinging on, desperately trying to maintain market share and
make their money from feeding and selling to their passengers on board
what have become plush floating restaurants and shopping malls.

Stephen McGinty looks at the man behind the illusion and finds a
consummate showman with an appetite for fame
DAVID Copperfield is slurping down vegetable soup and bread rolls. But
it's not a scene from a Dickens novel. The American magician's PR person
is making windmill motions with her hands. If she goes any harder she
will take off, which is not good, it would be more than her boss will do
tonight at Glasgow's SECC. The problem is the roof, it's too low.
''My arms are too tired after the tour . . . no that's not it. It's
the roof. I will bang my head, it's just a little low. I won't be flying
but all the ghosts will. They will be swirling around the heads of the
audience, it's fantastic.'' The ghosts come from the burnt down Barkley
House Brothel, truly now ladies of the night.
It's just a part of the blurring of fact and fiction, reality and
illusion; the line along which Copperfield walks like a trapeze star.
And he is, make no mistake, a star. Scottish audiences on his first
British tour will witness his efforts to avoid a six-foot circular saw;
to walk through a giant rotating fan, and to slice a woman in half --
vertically.
Audiences in America have long been familiar with the master
illusionist to whom the Statue of Liberty is but a prop to make
disappear and the Grand Canyon, not much more than a crack to levitate
over. His annual CBS-recorded TV shows can capture high ratings, but he
is a demon live. Five hundred shows a year is a figure regularly quoted
-- yet he insists he has cut down.
''BC . . . Before Claudia . . . (he is also engaged to supermodel
Claudia Schiffer) I was on the road all year round. Now I'm taking it a
little easier. I'm going on two-week vacations and enjoying myself. I
couldn't really do that before. I had girl friends but I've not really
had that much motivation to spend so much time with one before.''
It would seem that gentlemen do, indeed, prefer blondes. Copperfield
is a contrast, wearing black. Black leather jacket, black jeans, black
T-shirt, and big, black pointed silver-tipped cowboy boots. It's hard to
tell his height, as he was always sitting, lounging or propped on the
edge of a deep sofa on the 15th floor of Glasgow's Moat House Hotel.
Nice room, though. Copperfield has been sandwiched by bad press,
presenting him as nasty, aloof, a man surrounded by sycophants who hang
on his every word. The man responsible for the caricature, was publicist
Max Stafford Clark, who refused to work with him, preferring the company
of such bastions as Antonia de Sancha.
Copperfield does seem slightly shy, painfully polite and rather
relaxed. Answers do have to be goaded from him, and when they emerge
''woolly American'' is embroidered round the edges, but at least it's
natural fibres not barbed wire. For example, when asked whether he
wished to live in a world where real magic could exist, he answered:
''I wish! I would love to find real magic. But I think it does exist .
. . within each one of us. We just haven't figured out the way to
externalise it. But I think it's amazing what you can accomplish if you
believe in yourself. Get motivated! So far magic in that point of view I
think really does exist.
''Things have happened in my life just because I have wished for
them.''
Like what?
''Meeting people.''
Who?
''Famous people.''
Which ones?
''I never would have thought I would get to meet my idols.''
Which idols?
''Gene Kelly, Orson Welles . . . I didn't get to meet Fred Astaire or
Walt Disney. But it's great having royalty come to see you. You know?''
Well, not really, having only been the background in a picture of
Prince Edward.
''It's very validating.''
I'm sure it is, David.
''But there is enough to bring you back down to earth. You can't
please everybody. Certain people are not going to respect you, so you
have to work twice as hard.
''It's motivating when you see the lady in the front row who isn't
smiling. The whole audience can be applauding and cheering but all you
see is that one lady. I suppose, it's human nature.''
Magic, mystery and the elevation of his ''art form'' as he describes
his show five separate times, is the motor which rolls him along. He's a
showman sawing a sceptical audience in half, stitching them together
again, and praying they are impressed. ''I want people to appreciate
magic as they do the theatre, Broadway or the West End.''
The appeal of magic and illusion is mental. ''People are fascinated by
magic because it comes up at times of stress. It's a transporter. What
dancing is to the eyes and music is to the ears, magic is to the brain.
It captures the mind and wills you into a suspension of disbelief.''
David Copperfield plays God each night but during the day he prays.
Between bites of roll he explains: ''I just pray for help like everybody
else. Help for getting on with the day.'' With the PR person playing
whirlybirds to motion the time has now all but wound up, I ask what
magic trick remains unproduced.
''A family,'' he says with a smile. Claudia will be flying.

With every passing day, it seems, the public respects us less and
suspects us more
THE highly-respected Boston Globe newspaper recently drew attention to
the fact that, during the O J Simpson trial, the American Bar
Association commissioned a public opinion poll. Understandably, about
41% of those questioned admitted that they had lost what little respect
they had for lawyers.
But, perhaps more significantly, a greater number -- 56% -- said that
they now thought a great deal less of the country's news media. This
sorry state of affairs should come as no great surprise to anyone who
has had the misfortune of either watching American television or reading
American newspapers for any length of time. Both leave a great deal to
be desired.
Take television. From top to bottom, it is a disgrace. With the
honourable exception (at any given time) of a handful of programmes,
mostly superior drama and comedy, it is a diet of undiluted and
unadulterated drivel. You really can zap through more than 100 channels
and still find nothing worth watching.
But it is in the sphere of news coverage that it reaches its nadir.
Puerile, insular, vacuous, sensational, and just plain warped. It treats
stories as sales products, no different from soap or candy bars. The
news agenda is seldom concerned with proper news values and even less
with the provision of information to the public. The tales they tell are
simply weapons in the ratings war.
The more titivating and sexy the piece-to-camera, the more appealing
it is to the simple-minded mugs who watch it. The sad truth is that they
get what they want which, therefore, is no more than they deserve.
American news programmes aspire to nothing more than the supply of
banality. It is television of the lowest common denominator.
On a recent visit to the east coast of America, and as a journalist
with a professional interest in television, I took the opportunity of
watching what was on offer. Fortunately, since the trip was a holiday, I
had no great burning desire to find out what was happening abroad (news
junkie I ain't). This was just as well, really, since all of the major
networks appear to go out of their way to ignore international news.
Rupert Murdoch's giant Fox TV station, which covers the country,
probably offers the best shot with its World Minute segment on its
nightly news flagship programme. This is exactly what its name suggests
-- a 60-second round-up of international events. Go for a pee and you
will miss it. Then it's back to more important affairs -- like the
weather in Pawkepsie, or the traffic hold-ups on the Bronx Crosstown
Expressway, or perhaps the latest news from the Red Sox game. And all
the time, centre screen, are the interchangeable Barbie and Ken, the
slick airhead presenters of this notional news.
And notional news it most certainly is. It tells you absolutely
nothing. You, the viewer, are left asking more questions than the
answers any given story provides. During the recent east coast heatwave,
which saw temperatures soar to 108 degrees, one network reported that
more than 45 people had died in the Chicago area alone.
An important story? Certainly. But that was it. Not even the briefest
explanation as to how these poor people had met there fate. Had they
succumbed to heat stroke? Heart attacks? Skin cancer? Had they all been
trapped on board a subway train and slowly boiled to death like
lobsters?
You might say, of course, that this sorry state of affairs is entirely
up to the Americans; that it is none of our business. But it is
frightening to consider that America, the major player and the biggest
influence upon global events, forms its opinions largely through the
television news medium. It is no surprise, therefore, to find that your
average American citizen has a desperately myopic view -- if he or she
has any view at all -- of world affairs.
And yet, despite it all, more and more Americans are relying on
television to keep them up to date on current affairs. Fewer people than
ever are buying a daily newspaper. Circulation, or the lack of it, has
reached a crisis point. All over the country regional papers are closing
down.
Why? Well, part of the reason is because people have lost faith in the
American press. A recent Gallup poll suggested that 60% of the
population believed that the nation's media was ''out of touch with
average Americans.'' In another poll, a similar percentage considered
newspapers to be too cynical and too adversarial and actually ''got in
the way of society solving its problems''.
As Mark Jurkowitz, the readers' ombudsman for the Boston Globe, put it
in a recent article ''With every passing day, it seems, the public
respects us less and suspects us more.''
There is, he says, ''an epidemic of disdain'' in America with the
public even more cynical than the press about the honesty and ethical
standards of everyone from public officials to religious leaders to the
chief executives of major companies. If there is to be a cure for ''the
toxic levels of polarisation and incivility wreaking havoc with all
aspects of American life'' then, according to Jurkowitz, it will come
only when the messengers (the media) have reconnected with their
audience.
But it cannot all be put down to a lack of faith in newspapers. It
must also be said that the American press, both quality and tabloid, are
poor products -- and getting poorer by the day.
If nothing else, three weeks of American television and newspapers
serves to make one eternally grateful for one's own. Our newspapers may
have their faults but they are infinitely superior to their American
counterparts. Likewise, ITV, the BBC, and C4 are not without their
shortcomings but at least they provide a quality service which, by and
large, is reliable, truthful, informative, and at times groundbreaking.
They also realise that the world doesn't end at our national boundary.

LABOUR yesterday called on the Nolan Committee on standards in public
life to review its ''anti-sleaze'' guidelines on Ministers taking
private sector jobs.
Shadow industry spokesman Brian Wilson said the case of former Trade
Minister Richard Needham -- who is taking on three directorships two
months after quitting -- raised important questions about the
effectiveness of the rules.
But former Public Service Minister David Hunt, whose job it was to
implement the Nolan recommendations, said the changes would prove a
turning point in public attitudes to politicians.
Mr Needham has defended his right to join the boards of GEC and the
Mivan engineering and construction company, and to look for a third post
in his Wiltshire North constituency.
He insisted he was acting as if the Nolan recommendations -- due to
come into force next month -- were already in place.
Mr Needham consulted and was given clearance by both the Cabinet
Office and Lord Carlisle, whose Advisory Committee on Business
Appointments will vet ex-Ministers who wish to take outside jobs.
Mr Wilson said: ''Essentially Lord Carlisle is saying that Mr Needham
would have been able to behave in the same way post-Nolan as pre-Nolan.
''One really has to wonder if that is good enough to meet the public
concern which Lord Nolan's report recognised and sought to act upon.''
But Mr Hunt said the Nolan changes would prove effective.
''We will not see a situation any more where there is criticism of
Ministers because it will all be above board, cleared and checked out,
whether it is for Labour or Conservative politicians,'' he said.
A spokesman for the Nolan Committee said it was always made clear the
committee would assess the effectiveness of its recommendations after a
year and it had no intention of changing that timetable.

ROB ADAMS talks to a musical adventurer
TWENTY-FIVE years ago Hugh Hopper played the Royal Albert Hall Proms
with Soft Machine, the first rock band ever to do so.
Last month he played two Scottish dates in rather more modest
surroundings with a new band, North and South, the latest in a Rock
Family Trees-defying succession of line-ups that has grown, and
continues to grow, out of the so-called Canterbury Scene.
So-called because although the bands -- Soft Machine and Caravan --
which founded this very English brand of rock, with its insinuating
melodies, complex time signatures, daffy lyrics and phased Hammond organ
solos, started life in Canterbury, and in some cases continues to live
there, the Kentish town is not exactly a thriving musical metropolis.
As legions of Japanese tourists, who have taken this music to heart
and who arrive, agog, like Beatles fans doing the Merseybeat tour, have
discovered, and as Hopper cheerfully concedes, Canterbury is a handy
label that enables Hopper and former members of Hatfield and the North,
Gong et al to work, sometimes together but mostly abroad.
Indeed, North and South's concerts at The Lemon Tree, Aberdeen and
Edinburgh Book Festival's Spiegeltent trebled Hopper's British
appearances this year. With his ''Franglodutch'' band he tours France,
Belgium, and Holland, which were always receptive to the Canterbury
sound, up to three times a year, and he has trips to Japan and America
planned this autumn.
It's a living, not a luxurious one perhaps, but Hopper wouldn't have
it any other way, and if he has to take a job driving a taxi, as he has
done in the past, so be it.
When he left Soft Machine after their album Six, in 1973, he was
beginning to feel like a civil servant. ''I knew exactly where I was
going to be a year ahead and I didn't like that. Also I didn't like the
musical direction the band was heading in, and I wasn't personal friends
with the rest of the band.
''You can play with your worst enemy if the music's right, and you can
play music you're not happy with, if it means playing with friends. But
if you're not at one with the music or the people, you've had it.''
Post-Soft Machine, he has managed mostly to concentrate on musical
adventures of a friendly nature. He still writes songs, occasionally and
by post, with fellow former Soft, Robert Wyatt, and he contributed songs
and bass playing to fellow Canterbury resident, former Caravan and Camel
bassist, Richard Sinclair's 1994 album, R.S.V.P.
North and South reunites Hopper with Edinburgh drummer Mike Travis.
They worked in Japanese percussionist Stomu Yamash'ta's band and Travis
played on Hopper's Hopper Tunity Box album in the mid-seventies and have
been talking about doing something together again ever since. The band
also features keyboardist Paul Flush and saxophonist Steve Kettley, two
musicians who, although he hadn't worked with them before this week's
rehearsals (like Wyatt, they have been musical penpals so far), Hopper
suspects fall into his favourite musical category: hooligan romantics.
As he explains: ''Any rock musician can blast away all night (and that
can be great). And a lot of jazz and classical music is soft and tender.
No problem. But the musicians and writers who give me most pleasure are
those who have both ends of the spectrum and know instinctively when to
use the sledgehammer and when to use the delicate paintbrush. I hope I
am also one of them.''

A GOLF trade initiative aimed at gaining a share of the American
market, worth up to #2000m a year, was launched yesterday by Mr George
Kynoch, Industry Minister.
The first outing of the Scottish Golf Trade Association's ''Links of
Scotland'' initiative will be next week's US PGA golf exhibition in Las
Vegas.
Around 40 manufacturers, producing a variety of equipment from antique
and hi-tech clubs to towels, brollies, and golf art, have joined the
association.
Among the more unusual products are a range of preserves linked to
famous courses.

A VICTIM of playground taunts carried out a glass attack on his former
tormentor during a chance meeting eight years after they left school.
Mr Albert Young lost the sight of an eye after he was struck in the
face in a Fife bar.
His attacker, Andrew Anderson, 24, of The Ark a' The Cross, Culross,
Fife, was jailed for three years at the High Court in Edinburgh
yesterday, after he admitted assaulting Mr Young to his severe injury
and permanent disfigurement.
The assault took place at the Tanners public house in Blairhall, Fife,
on September 11 last year.
Mr William Totten, Advocate-depute, told the court the two men had
been at secondary school together, where Mr Young admitted he had given
Anderson ''a bit of verbal hassle''.
Eight years after leaving school, the two met again for the first time
in the bar. Staff noticed some tension in the air before Anderson struck
Mr Young on the head with a glass.
Anderson told police: ''I am sorry about that. I had the tumbler in my
hand. I didn't mean it with the glass in my hand.''
Mr Totten said Mr Young, 24, was taken to hospital, but the attack
cost him the sight of an eye.

AN ACTION group was formed last night in Thurso to counter the bad
publicity the County of Caithness has attracted in recent years because
of media interest in Dounreay and the plant's problems, but not to act
as a mouthpiece for the nuclear plant.
The idea originally came from Thurso councillor Falconer Waters, who
was recently elected to represent the area on the new all-purpose
Highland Council.
Mr Waters said last night: ''When we were canvassing round the doors,
the biggest issue was the Dounreay situation and particularly the bad PR
and media hype about the spots of contamination found within restricted
areas at Dounreay.
''This was held to be seriously undermining the confidence in the
community. It was felt to have an adverse effect on tourism and
therefore on the business community which would drain the county quite
unnecessarily.''
He added: ''We all felt that the publicity had been blown out of all
proportion. We have had people asking if it's safe to walk on the
promenade. Are the beaches safe from contamination? Are you people
contaminated? Some of the things that have been said are completely
unfounded.''
It was not the intention to try to defend Dounreay. The plant itself
employed people to do that. They would not be Dounreay's lap dog.
Mr Hugh Manson, secretary of the Thurso Community Council, who is also
employed at Dounreay and is chairman of the CPSA union branch there,
agreed: ''The problems are beginning to affect the whole community.
''It affects tourism to a certain extent, because people don't want to
come north, because they possibly think all our beaches are
contaminated. They possibly think the whole county is contaminated. They
forget that Dounreay is only a very small part of Caithness.
''The people in Caithness know what is going on at Dounreay. We have
suffered no ill-effects ourselves -- so it is to counteract that
impression which is given further south.''

A MOTHER whose son has been left brain-damaged has demanded a
top-level inquiry into the cause.
Three-year-old Fraser Imrie has been left with cerebral palsy after he
was struck by the E-coli 0157 bacterium.
His mother, Mrs Fiona Imrie, said yesterday that little appeared to
have been done to detect the source of what she believes is a growing
public health problem. She said that she would be writing to a Commons
select committee, set up to look at children's diseases, to demand an
investigation.
''I'm planning to write and find out what will be happening.
Obviously, this is a disease which affects children and the elderly. We
have got to find out what causes this disease and why some people are
more affected than others,'' she said.
Mrs Imrie, 32, who also has a six-month-old son, said the infection
could be passed in other ways as well as through meat and dairy
products.
''You can get it from animals, including cats under a year old, young
lambs and cows,'' she said.
One of the possible causes Mrs Imrie wants to see investigated is the
effect of slurry spraying. The cause of her son's infection remains a
mystery.
He spent three months in hospital after his parents noticed blood
during a diarrhoea attack in June. The bacteria attacked his kidneys and
his heart and affected the flow of blood to the brain, causing the palsy
and leaving him in need of a kidney transplant.
Mrs Imrie, a dentist, from North Berwick, East Lothian, claimed that
Scotland had the worst figures the world in cases of the disease.
The bacteria claimed the life of a West Lothian child and affected 69
others in an E-coli 0157 outbreak stemming from a local dairy last year.
Dr John Cowden, consultant epidemiologist at the Scottish Infection
Control Unit at Ruchill Hospital in Glasgow, said every case of E-coli
was followed up individually by the unit, but unless there had been an
outbreak affecting a number of people, it would be difficult to trace
its source.
E-coli 0157 was first identified in Canada in the 1970s and its
occurrence has increased significantly in Scotland in the last five
years.
Since 1989, the number of reported cases has more than trebled, from
87 to 236, Dr Cowden said.
A spokesman for the Scottish Office denied that little had been done
to investigate the cause.
''Wide-ranging research is being sought into E-coli, its prevalence,
treatment and how the population as a whole might be advised to counter
it,'' he said.

FROM Venezuela to Ukraine, from China to Finland; in 19 countries, 36
young hopefuls are at present packing their bags, their music, and their
worry beads. Destination? Glasgow. Beginning on Sunday and running for
almost a week, the city will resound to the clatter of keyboards as the
fourth Scottish International Piano Competition (SIPC) is staged in the
city.
It was tempting to write that the city will be gripped by SIPC fever
during the next week. Certainly, during the past three competitions, a
degree of partisanship towards this or that pianist has developed
through the knock-out rounds, that -- at its peak -- has been
reminiscent of the gladiatorial arena. (Not least when one team of
incensed supporters turned up at the main door of The Herald to do
damage to the present writer for his views, and had to be repulsed by a
senior executive of the company.)
Perhaps in the coming competition, which opens on Sunday, the fever
might not be so rampant; in the past it was undoubtedly stoked up by the
nightly television coverage on BBC Scotland, which will be sadly missing
from the arena. (Claims by the BBC that their production resources were
fully committed led to MP John Maxton raising the issue before a Commons
Select Committee; to no avail.)
Anyway, towards the weekend, the young hopefuls -- all between the
ages of 17 and 31 -- will descend on Glasgow, where they will be given
accommodation, hospitality, and pianos galore, by residents of the city.
On Saturday night they will be feted at a reception at the Royal
Scottish Academy of Music and Drama, where the eliminatory rounds of the
competition will take place. And then on Sunday, jaws clenched and
fingers flexed, the playing will begin.
More than 200 pianists from around the world applied to compete (or
participate, as the organisers would probably prefer to say). Of these,
36 pianists, from the full range of continents (including one stateless
East European), and all of them already prize-winners in one competition
or another, have been chosen to appear.
All of them have one target: to survive the opening round recital
(where, it has been proved in the past, even the most capable can
stumble), get through the semi-final recitals, and aim for a coveted
place in the final itself, where four pianists will each play a full
concerto with the Royal Scottish National Orchestra in Glasgow's Royal
Concert Hall on Sunday, September 17.
There is, for the young pianists, big money at stake. The competition,
sponsored by BT, carries a total cash prize for the winner of #10,000,
with #5000 for second place, and #2000 each to the two other finalists.
But there's more here than the money, the trophies (including the
elegant winner's trophy, commissioned by BT from Glasgow School of Art
student, Carol Holloway), and the gold medals.
Apart from the chance of a finalist being talent-spotted, there are
the opportunities of engagements -- and not necessarily just for the
ultimate prize-winners -- deeply cherished by the competition organisers
as a crucial, structural part of the whole event.
Offers of engagement, in principle, have been made by the BT Scottish
Ensemble (a concert tour), by Enterprise Music Scotland (six
engagements) by the Montreal Chamber Orchestra, the Prague Chamber
Orchestra, the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, the Royal SNO, the Scottish
Chamber Orchestra, Mayfest, the MacRobert Centre in Stirling, and a host
of music clubs and societies.
The week of the competition is a gruelling and hair-raising week for
all concerned: for the jury, which is graced by the presence of such
pianistic luminaries as John Lill, the greatest of all British pianists,
and the Armenian pianist Seta Tanyel; and for the young pianists
themselves, of course. Inevitably there will be some shattered nerves
and egos at the end of it all -- and there will be tears.
And for the diehard audience, that, if previous patterns are followed,
will build (in numbers and intensity of support) throughout the week
--there are two long playing sessions every day, except Wednesday, and
all rounds are open to the public.
And spare a thought for the Royal Scottish National Orchestra and its
conductor Christopher Seaman. By late Friday night, four pianists will
have made it to the final. Their chosen concerto (from a list of 21)
will be announced to the orchestra who, with Christopher Seaman, will go
in at the deep end on Sunday with one-shot rehearsals.
By that stage, the emotional temperature will be near boiling point.
Nobody, present at a concerto rehearsal in an earlier competition, will
forget the late conductor Bryden Thomson's reaction when faced with a
young prima donna of a pianist who first wanted it this speed, then that
speed, and finally he wasn't sure at all what speed he wanted it at.
Thomson, stoical to a fault, finally cracked: ''Listen sonny,'' he
snarled, with his famous rictus of a grin. ''We're very flexible here,
but what d'you think we are? An effin' rubber band?'' Result: one young
punctured ego.
* Scottish International Piano Competition at the RSAMD:
Stage 1 -- Sunday to Tuesday, 1.15pm and 6.45pm;
Stage 2 -- Thursday and Friday, 1.15pm and 6.45pm;
Finals -- Sunday 17, Royal Concert Hall, 6.45pm.

MORE than 900 jobs are to be created in Glasgow after the opening of a
#17m TSB tele-banking centre yesterday.
The centre, in Atlantic Quay, will employ around 250 operators
initially, expected to rise to around 900 over the next few years. It
will be the bank's main outlet to dispense financial advice and sell
mortgages to customers across the UK.
The investment marks the third significant expansion in the call
centre industry in Scotland in the past month, following projects by BT
in Motherwell and IBM in Greenock.
Around 5000 people now work in the sector, in more than 50 exchanges,
with 4000 jobs based in and around Glasgow.
At the opening, Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth said it was the
sound of Scotland that drew investors north.''A skilled and flexible
workforce together with one of the most advanced and comprehensive
telecommunications networks anywhere in Europe has made Scotland the
obvious choice for such projects.
''If somebody gets a Scottish accent on the telephone they feel more
secure. They identify with our reputation for financial shrewdness and
even caution.''
Mr Peter Ellwood, TSB group chief executive, called the centre ''a
significant new chapter'' in his bank's long association with the city.
He confirmed the company had chosen Glasgow over several rival sites in
the North of England, adding: ''Scotland has simply got some very good,
high-calibre people who have proved successful in this sector.''
However, he said that tele-banking procedure would be tightly
monitored in future, in the light of an award made in the High Court in
Leeds against Lloyds Bank on Monday. The bank was forced to pay more
than #77,000 to a couple who claimed they had received negligent advice
about a loan.
Mr Ellwood said: ''We are looking at a transcript of the hearing.''

A FATHER and his young son have died in Lanarkshire in a road accident
in which a car and a motorcycle collided and caught fire.
The boy's mother, who managed to get clear, was unable, despite
frantic efforts, to save them from the blazing car in which they had
been travelling home after a family funeral.
The 32-year-old motorcyclist, whose fuel tank exploded on impact, was
thrown from his machine and was also killed in the accident on the A70
Edinburgh-Ayr road on Monday night.
Yesterday a spokesman for Strathclyde Fire Brigade described it as ''a
tragic accident''. He said that firefighters who attended the scene had
been confronted by ''a ball of fire''.
Farm manager Alan Dunlop, 49, of Boreland Farm, Eddleston, Peebles,
died instantly in the wreckage of the blazing Ford Orion.
Eleven-year-old David Dunlop was taken, along with his mother
Jeanette, 44, to Law Hospital. He had suffered severe burns across his
whole body and yesterday morning died in the Carluke hospital.
The Honda motorcyclist who was killed at the scene of the accident,
about half a mile west of Sandilands Road End near Lanark, was named as
Mr Robert Tough, of Silvermuir Avenue, Cleghorn, Lanark.
Last night Mrs Dunlop, who was treated in hospital for arm and ankle
injuries, was preparing to tell her nine-year-old son Gordon of the
tragedy.
Mr Dunlop, who had been attending his father's funeral in Ayrshire,
was a member of Ayr Rugby Club and on the local primary school board at
Eddleston.
Mr Tough, whose body landed in the garden of a house where he had been
fitting carpets the day before the accident, was said by relatives to
have ''lived for the bike''.
Strathclyde Police have appealed for witnesses to the accident, which
happened around 7.45pm on Monday. Anyone with any information is asked
to contact police at Motherwell.

After three hectic weeks of reviewing superb music, MICHAEL TUMELTY
congratulates Festival director Brian McMaster for an audacious
programme
LAST Saturday morning, on the closing day of the Edinburgh Festival,
and at the last round of awards of Herald Angels at the Festival
Theatre, one of the coveted winged sculptures was presented to festival
director Brian McMaster. The inscription said, simply, Festival Music
1995.
Of course there was more to it than that. It wasn't merely a good
music programme; there have been plenty of them. And it wasn't just the
structure, which was superb, and which I've written about before. As
well as being stuffed with goodies -- a few of them by now well in the
past but indelibly burned into the memory -- this was a festival music
programme that in an unspectacular way was quite audacious.
It became known in music circles as McMaster's Revenge on the Critics.
Seldom have such marathon programmes been staged -- with some shows
running to four hours and more. Lengthy though these may have been to
the public with a bus to catch, they had a special piquancy for hacks.
It was rumoured in bars at large that McMaster had taken the trouble to
find out deadlines for late editions of newspapers, and then constructed
a series of music programmes to finish 15 minutes before those deadlines
fell.
And, at that point, apologies to the people I mowed down every night
while exiting at high speed from the Usher Hall, and, particularly, to
the dedicated Herald reader who innocently stopped me, while I was in
desperate search for a taxi, to ask my opinion, and got her head bitten
off.
The point, anyway, wasn't just the length of these programmes; it was
the challenge they represented to listeners and to the orthodoxies of
concert planning -- from four hours of non-stop Bach to undiluted
programmes of Dvorak concertos, to unremittingly tough programmes of
modern music, Scottish and German.
The ultimate risk in all of these was to the box office. Confounding a
number of predictions, and I think to everybody's surprise, attendances
seemed not only to hold but to soar. Two weeks into the Festival the
administration was reporting 82% average attendances at the Usher Hall.
I can't remember when I've seen so many full houses at such unlikely
events.
Everybody who stayed the course at the Festival has their own special
memories: moments when you drop your guard, let the critical objectivity
slide and the tears flow. Most of these, by their nature, you want to
keep private. But few rival the intense flow of emotion at the recital
by the delectable soprano Galina Gorchakova, who, soaring over the
residual effects of her bronchitis, gave a molten performance at the
Queen's Hall which culminated in an encore of Puccini's Vissi d'arte
that utterly dissolved her audience.
Gorchakova's one nod towards her illness and the prima donna
temperament, incidentally, led to her cancelling the scheduled live
broadcast of that recital on Radio 3. The BBC, completely unfazed and
with considerable dexterity, promptly fished out of the archives the
same lady's recital at last year's Festival and broadcast that one at
the scheduled time.
As to next year; no-one knows what Brian McMaster has under his hat.
It will be the 50th Edinburgh Festival. Something special will be
planned no doubt. If it involves more marathons and the nightmarish race
to the deadline, then, personally, I quake at the prospect. The man has
a wickedly mischievous grin. I don't trust him.

FORMER Tory MP Alan Amos has defected to the Labour Party. He accused
the Conservatives of hating minorities such as homosexuals and blacks.
He also attacked Tory parliamentary selection committees, saying they
were dominated by straight-laced elderly women.
Mr Amos, 42, was elected MP for Hexham in 1987 and stayed in the job
for five years until he resigned following his arrest and cautioning for
alleged indecency on Hampstead Heath.
He disclosed that he had joined the Labour Party last October and
wants to be a Labour MP.

HANGER 13, the Ayrshire rave venue where three youngsters took the
drug ecstasy and subsequently died, is under consideration for a new
licence under altered terms. It would not be used for raves.
Nor would the name be used again, stated Mr Fraser McIntyre, who ran
the dance club in the council-owned Pavilion.
He was appearing yesterday with his mother, Mrs Christine Ridha,
before Kyle and Carrick's licensing committee in support of their
application for a renewal of the entertainments licence previously held
by McCall's Entertainments Ltd, of which both are directors.
He accepted that there would be no more raves at the night spot.
Councillor Robin Reid proposed that the licensing committee should find
its own definition of a rave.
Provost Gibson MacDonald told mother and son: ''We want to see you
back in business -- but in a way that is acceptable to the public.''
The committee decided to grant a new entertainment licence. But
details of what events that will cover are subject to further
discussion.
Last night, Mr McIntyre said that although he was disappointed it had
taken so long to reach a decision, he was satisfied that it would allow
them to reopen in the near future.

PARENTS last night called for a full scientific investigation into a
cluster of eye deformities among children in Fife, after a health board
study proved inconclusive.
The study found no evidence to prove or disprove a link between
agricultural chemicals and the incidence of children born with rare eye
defects.
It was launched earlier this year after six children were born in the
Ladybank area of Fife with poorly developed eyes or no eyes at all. Fife
Health Board yesterday approved a further study into the causes, but the
parents fear it will not go far enough, and want full laboratory tests
to be undertaken.
The parents believe the conditions microphthalmia, anophthalmia, and
coloboma are due to exposure to two fungicides, benomyl which is
routinely available in garden centres, and carbendazim.
Dr Mike Roworth, consultant in public health, said there had been 22
cases of the conditions in Fife between 1981 and 1993, when 15 could
have been expected.
''This is likely to be a chance finding, and may be an artefact
created by improved recording and/or recollection of more recent
cases.''
However, he said the birth prevalence of the conditions in Fife was
relatively high.
Although the use of the chemicals on farmland in East Fife was also
higher than the Scottish average -- in 1991, nearly 60 times higher for
benomyl and for carbendazim five times higher -- the last four cases of
microphthalmia in Fife occurred in the west.
''It is not possible to say, from the information available, to what
extent mothers of affected children would be exposed to these fungicides
during the relevant period of pregnancy,'' Dr Roworth added.
The health board accepted his recommendations for a further study to
find out more accurate information -- particularly relating to where
mothers stayed during pregnancy -- and continued monitoring of the
conditions.
However, Mr Peter Attenborough, fundraiser for the Micro and
Anophthalmic Children's Society, said: ''The recommendations have not
gone far enough.''
''What we really need is a proper independent scientific study with
laboratory tests, to make a detailed and exhaustive investigation,'' he
added.
The Fife cluster is centred around six cases in the Ladybank area.
A test case brought by parents against US chemical giant Dupont, which
manufactures the pesticides, is due to go before a grand jury in Florida
later this year.
''If this is successful, the floodgates will be open worldwide,'' Mr
Attenborough said.
Professor John Forrester, of Aberdeen University's department of
ophthalmology, said the absence of sufficient data for scientific proof
did not mean there was no link.
Meanwhile, a mother whose son has been left brain-damaged has demanded
a top-level inquiry into the cause.
Three-year-old Fraser Imrie, from North Berwick, East Lothian, has
been left with cerebral palsy after he was struck by the E-coli 0157
bacterium.
His mother, Mrs Fiona Imrie, 32, said yesterday that little appeared
to have been done to detect the source of what she believes is a growing
public health problem. She said that she would be writing to a Commons
select committee, set up to look at children's diseases, to demand an
investigation.
* The Health and Safety Executive has warned farmers to be careful
when spraying crops, after new figures showed a rise in the number of
people complaining of being made ill by pesticides.
Last year, there were 251 pesticide incidents in the UK, 41 of them in
Scotland. People complained of illness in 128 cases, compared to 88 in
the previous year. A total of 31 cases went to court, after which 27
people were found guilty and fined an average of #433.

THE concept of supermarket fashion is this, that along with a pound of
mince, alcohol, disinfectant, and a microwave, you can buy a bra or a
suit for the office. Like the Scouts, today's supermarket is always
prepared, with products which are ready to cook, ready to use, ready to
eat, and now ready to wear.
It was with this in mind that a Herald entourage appeared at the door
of Peter Fay's office, store manager of the Tesco Metro on Argyle
Street, Glasgow, for a photo-shoot. It was clear, if high fashion can be
bought in a supermarket, then it can stand being worn there too.
We had been escorted to his room by a member of staff, who put us in
an industrial lift. We were then submerged below floor level. The
photographer became a tad nervous, saying the scene reminded him of the
film Angelheart, and we then experienced much trepidation about our next
stop. A quick tramp through the bowels of the building and we arrived.
The paper was represented by a model, a photographer, and myself, and
not only did Fay, who far from resembled any malevolent force
considering the depths of his location, grant us full and proper use of
his supermarket, but he assigned us a helper too from his own staff, a
woman called Ann Barnardo, who was as friendly and humanitarian as her
surname suggests.
''I'm quite happy to be here,'' she said, smiling, as we went into our
next hour, ''otherwise I'd be lifting heavy weights.''
As it was, Ann's remit was to smooth down rumpled packets and tidy
pokes and generally preen any background which might appear in shot. A
job she did so very well, in fact, she appears in many of our rolls of
film.
It was raining outside, so we were glad we had an inside venue.
Supermarkets are like the pub. A mass of individuals gather to consume,
and you couldn't mix with such an unknown quantity if you ripped a page
out of the phone book. We first had Sam, our model, in a twinset and
pearls, perusing the fruit and vegetables. Then browsing through
magazines, selecting meat produce in black, and chatting up men at the
till. All the way through the three-hour shoot she had the undivided
attention of all shoppers. The aisles became constipated with trolleys.
''Is that Madonna?'' inquired a woman all of four feet and 60 years. I
didn't ask her why on earth she'd think a pop star would be endorsing a
supermarket, but she obviously thought that Tesco was bigger than
Madonna.
''I wish I had a figure like that,'' sighed one of the staff.
''What's her name?'' the old bird insisted, who, by this time had
managed to squeeze in front of me, to get a penguin's view of the
circus.
''Sam,'' I humoured. ''Sam?'' she returned. She went quiet. ''Sam
who?''
All around, people passed by or stood transfixed. You know when
someone is mesmerised when they don't see you staring right at them. I,
of course, took a back seat, which I am not accustomed to, but I did
learn much about the power of beauty. Because even those who pretended
they didn't care, or thought our presence a minor inconvenience, stopped
at the nearest corner shelf and swatched a quick ogle at our model.
Sam was a star. She adopted serene, moody poses, or flashed her pearly
whites and gullet in mock amazement. To express the busy nature of the
supermarket, we collared a young German, browsing through cereals with a
rucksack on his back, and asked him if he would hold a conversation with
Sam for the sake of the camera. Shock registered on his face. He took so
long to answer the pics were taken anyway.
''I hope zey do not have zis paper in Germany,'' he said. It wasn't
until another guy, who was accosted at the till, expressed the hope that
his girlfriend never saw the photos that we cottoned on to the reason
why men were so reluctant to pose. They thought it might look as if they
were out and about with another woman. (What does this mean, we wondered
-- that one is unfaithful if one goes out shopping with someone else?)
We pitied them, they flattered themselves, cos Sam would have had more
taste.

POLICE are searching for a child abductor after a four-year-old girl
was seized overnight and left wandering streets 35 miles from her home.
They said the incident mirrored the kidnapping of a five-year-old girl
in May. Both girls were found in the same area.
Detective Superintendent Dave Wilson, of Northumbria Police, said:
''There is a very dangerous man on the loose.''
The victim in the first incident was found two miles from the area of
Darlington, Durham, where the four-year-old was found yesterday.
She went missing on Monday evening while playing outside her home in
Newcastle-upon- Tyne.
The child, who was examined by doctors last night, was found following
an extensive search launched after she was seen walking hand-in-hand
with a man in his 40s.
Mr Wilson said: ''She has been recovered alive in Darlington. She was
found wandering lost and was reported to the police, and is now reunited
with her mother.''
The abductor had dark, untidy hair and was clean-shaven, wearing dirty
flared trousers and a black-and-white checked shirt.
The girl was found 17 hours after the abduction. She was wandering in
Bulmer Square, Darlington.
The child seized in May from another part of Newcastle was found near
a churchyard in Vane Terrace, Darlington.
The four-year-old was back with her mother yesterday afternoon after a
reunion at Darlington police station.
Meanwhile, the mother of the girl taken in May said: ''Thank God she's
OK I'm so pleased for the mother and father.
''They will have gone through hell in the past few hours.''
The five-year-old girl abducted in May was approached by a man as she
played with friends near a shopping centre in Blakelaw, Newcastle.
He pushed her into a car and drove off. She was later found wandering
in Darlington, uninjured but traumatised.
The girl found in Darlington yesterday knocked on the front door of a
house in Bulmer Square.
Resident Jacqueline Coates, 33, said: ''The knocking got louder and
when I opened the door I saw a little girl standing there. She was
crying.
''She just said: 'I have lost my daddy, I can't find my daddy'.''
Mrs Coates gently led the child into her home. She realised the girl
was lost and disoriented and gave her a packet of crisps and a drink.
She then contacted the police as she remembered a girl had been
reported missing on TV news bulletins.

TIM MOYNIHAN gauges the reactions of RAF and US pilots after the air
raids
RAF pilots yesterday carried out a successful mission to bomb an
ammunition dump in Bosnia.
Two Harriers and a Jaguar flew out from Gioia del Colle, southern
Italy, as Nato air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs resumed.
The Harriers dropped two 1000lb laser-guided bombs each, under
direction from the Jaguar, hitting two bunkers in the dump south of
Sarajevo.
A follow-up wave of three Harriers and a Jaguar put back to Italy
without dropping their bombs, though, as the weather closed in and on
the receiving end of anti-aircraft fire.
The Harrier pilots, a 29-year-old from Portsmouth and a 32-year-old
Londoner, who as is customary cannot be named, had not dropped bombs in
last week's strikes.
The 29-year-old said: ''It hasn't really sunk in yet. We do a lot of
training with live weapons, but it's not the same as dropping it on a
live target.''
He added: ''We will have a beer together tonight, but we have to be
ready for tomorrow.''
The Jaguar pilot, a 34-year-old living in Norwich, carried out a
similar role in a raid last week, and said: ''The mission went very
well.''
The sortie lasted one and a half hours after the planes set off at 3pm
local time. They taxied out to the runway at the Italian base after
last-minute checks to the machines.
The bombs carried messages such as ''If you can read this, then you're
probably standing too close'' and ''Ethnic cleansing doesn't pay''.
The Harrier pilots agreed they felt some fear and tension as they
headed for the target but that gave way to total concentration on
hitting it when they got close.
The 32-year-old said: ''After hitting the target you realise you have
not yet finished the job as you have to get out safely without any of
you being shot down, and the fear returns, to a certain extent.''
They felt sympathy for the pilots in the second ''package'' of
aircraft who had to abort their mission to bomb another ammunition dump
elsewhere in Bosnia.
''It's frustrating, you have the adrenalin to go and do the job, then
you end up not doing it,'' the 32-year-old said.
Both Harrier pilots suffered similar frustration when a mission they
were on was aborted last week.
Detachment commander Group Captain Graham Cullington said: ''The first
attack sortie was very successful, the second hampered by the weather.
''The equipment is working very well, the crews are performing
extremely well, we could gear up even more if we needed to.''
Asked how long they could continue the operation if need be, he said:
''The aircraft are all serviceable, the crews are being rested where
possible, and we could continue almost indefinitely.''
It was handshakes and thumbs-up signs all round when a second wave of
planes returned safely to base on the US aircraft carrier Theodore
Roosevelt in the Adriatic.
The cheerful scenes belied days of waiting and long hours on alert as
the clock ticked past the Monday night deadline.
''I got four hours sleep,'' said one pilot, who was among the first to
scramble when the strike call came.
He said he was ''up pretty late last night'' and plans were changed
repeatedly. He finally went to bed expecting no action.
When the order was given to shift from regular flights to air strikes,
he said: ''My reaction was, okay'.''
The pilot said his mission, a strike against a vehicle storage
facility, went very well.
''I had a good hit,'' he said. ''They didn't know we were coming, they
didn't expect us.''

BRITAIN sent a powerful message last night to Bosnian Serb army
commander General Ratko Mladic: withdraw your heavy weapons or face the
consequences.
Defence Secretary Michael Portillo, speaking in an exclusive interview
with PA News, said Nato and the United Nations were firm in their
resolution.
''Mladic will realise that his ability to wage war is all the time
being reduced by the damage inflicted in weaponry, ammunition dumps,
command and control centres, radar equipment and anti-aircraft
equipment,'' he said.
''All these things damage his ability to fight on or to come to the
negotiating table in a strong position.''
Asked what would happen if General Mladic continued to defy Nato and
the UN, Mr Portillo emphasised: ''He must face the consequences.''
He gave a warning that the air strikes would continue until the
Bosnian Serbs fully comply with the demands of Nato and the UN to
withdraw heavy weapons from the 12-mile exclusion zone around Sarajevo
and guarantee the safety of all the UN-declared safe areas.
''Our objective is to make Sarajevo a safe city and it cannot be safe
while Bosnian Serb artillery can open fire at any moment,'' he said.
Mr Portillo revealed there had been ''intense communications'' between
the UN commander, Lieutenant General Bernard Janvier and the Bosnian
Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, this morning before the order to launch
new air strikes was given.
''But they were evidently not enough to convince the UN they were
serious about complying.''
Mr Portillo emphasised there were only weeks to go before a resolution
to the crisis would have to be found.
The new American peace initiative, spearheaded by Assistant Secretary
of State Richard Holbrooke, coupled with the new robust military
strategy, will be crucial to the future of the entire UN mission in
Bosnia.
Mr Portillo said: ''I have a very strong sense of matters being
brought to a head.''
He said decisions would have to be made over the next few weeks before
the harsh Bosnian winter sets in.
''If we are not successful then certainly the question of whether the
UN can continue in the former Yugoslavia will be raised more accutely
than ever before,'' he said.
''The UN will have to assess whether it is right to go on and do its
job. My hope is that the UN will be able to.''

THE pilot of the British jet that plunged into Lake Ontario during a
weekend air show said days before that he would perform tricks that
would test the plane ''close to its limits''.
''We're going to be doing some maneuvers that aren't really typical of
the normal job we do,'' Dom Gilbert, 31, said in a television interview
last week. He was one of seven airmen killed on Saturday as thousands of
spectators watched.
''We'll be maneuvering this airplane close to its limits -- both in
speed and stall and center of gravity limits -- and, as well, the
G-limit, the actual stress on the airframe,'' Gilbert told CHCH-TV.
When asked about the highlight of the show, he described the final
move that ended in tragedy.
''We go as vertical as we can and we turn the airplane as far upside
down as we dare,'' he said. ''Sometimes we're lucky enough to draw a
heart in the sky as well. It depends on the wind, so we'll see what
happens.''
About 48 hours later, the Royal Air Force Nimrod, with Gilbert at the
controls, plunged into the lake in front of more than 100,000
spectators.
One body was removed from the underwater crash site on the weekend.
Defense Department officials said two more bodies were located today.
They said pinpointing a cause of the crash will take weeks.
Theories include an aerodynamic stall or a loss of power because of a
flock of birds sucked into engine air intakes.
Angus McPhee, RAF squadron leader, said Gilbert was displaying the
kind of ''bravado'' typical of pilots trying to hype interest in an air
show.
''When pilots are explaining what they do, at times they're likely to
exaggerate a bit,'' he said. ''It adds a bit of mystique.''
''There was no way that man was overstressing his aircraft during his
display,'' McPhee said. ''Everything that was done was well within the
capabilities of the aircraft.''

HILLARY Clinton gave China no respite at the world women's conference
today, making thinly veiled attacks on Beijing's human rights and
population policies.
On the first full day of debate about women's issues at the United
Nations' gathering, the First Lady set the meeting alight with one
message: human rights are women's rights and women's rights are human
rights.
She said: ''We women come together every day to talk: about our
aspirations, concerns, families, work. There is far more unites us
around the world than divides us as women.''
Addressing an overflowing meeting with as many people crowded around
TV screens in adjacent rooms as were in the auditorium which seats 5000,
Mrs Clinton said: ''This conference gives a voice to the experience of
women that would go unnoticed. It makes her words heard which would be
unheard. It is important that all governments accept the responsibility
to protect international human rights.''
To loud applause at each point, she went on: ''For too long history
has silenced women.
''Even today there are those who would silence our words. But I say
loud and clear it is a violation of human rights that babies are denied
food and water, suffocated, and have their spines broken because they
are born girls.
''It is a violation of human rights that women and girls are sold into
slavery for human greed -- that should not be tolerated.
''It is a violation of human rights women are doused in petrol and
burned alive because their marriage dowry is too small. It is a
violation of human rights that thousands of women are raped as a tactic
of war.
''It is a violation of human rights that the leading cause of death
worldwide for women aged between 14 and 44 is violence in their own home
from a relative.
''It is a violation of human rights that girls are brutalised by
genital mutilation. It is a violation of human rights that women are
denied the right to plan their own families and are forced to have
abortions or be sterilised against their will.
''I have one message today: human rights are women's rights and
women's rights are human rights, once and for all.''
She concluded: ''That is our vision from Beijing. We must move beyond
the rhetoric now.''
Her hard-hitting speech, clearly directed at China, came as Sino-US
relations have plunged to what Beijing has called their lowest point
since they were established 16 years ago, chiefly over disputes about US
policy towards Taiwan.
Many who wanted to participate in the sessions, held once every 10
years, said they had been denied visas, while others said they were
harassed by police and were under surveillance when they reached the
event.
''It is indefensible that many women in non-governmental organisations
who wished to participate in this conference have not been able to
attend or have been prohibited from fully taking part,'' Mrs Clinton
said to cheers.
She declared: ''Freedom means the right of people to assemble,
organise, and debate openly. It means respecting the views of those who
may disagree with the views of their governments.''
Professor Mary Ann Glendon, head of the Vatican delegation, fought her
corner on the population issue.
''The Holy See joins with all participants in the conference in
condemnation of coercion in population policies,'' she said.
Professor Glendon also launched the Vatican's pro-life campaign with a
plea for greater male sexual responsibility and action to end reasons
for abortion.
''All who are genuinely committed to the advancement of women can and
must offer a women or a girl who is pregnant, frightened, and alone, a
better alternative than the destruction of her own unborn child,'' the
first woman to head a delegation from the Holy See told delegates.

HURRICANE Luis took aim at the US Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico today
after howling through several resort islands, killing a French tourist
and terrorizing thousands of others.
In Guadeloupe, waves as high as nine feet swept the 29-year-old French
tourist from a jetty while he was trying to photograph the sea.
Thirteen people were hurt as the hurricane brushed past the island.
The 140mph winds destroyed several hotels and nightclubs overnight on
Antigua.
Among hundreds of British tourists forced to flee the Caribbean island
was Labour deputy leader John Prescott.
Mr Prescott, 57, and his wife, Pauline, cut short their holiday by two
days, flying back to Britain on Monday as the 140mph storm hit.
Back in his Hull constituency yesterday, he said there had been little
panic among the estimated 1500 British tourists on the island, although
some had been understandably nervous.
Meanwhile, US Virgin Islands Governor, Roy L. Schneider, declared a
state of emergency and imposed a curfew to prevent looting.
Airports were jammed by those trying to flee, but time was running
short.
The airports in the US Virgin Islands closed at midday and the last
flight out of Puerto Rico was scheduled for 6:45pm, hours before Luis'
expected arrival.
People on several islands that Luis battered experienced sheer terror.
''At one point during the storm I thought 'Just get me through this
alive,' ' said Kim Derrick, who survived the storm with her two
daughters and husband in St John's, Antigua.
At least two hotels were washed away, a nightclub was flattened, and
hundreds of homes were damaged, Derrick said.

A JEWISH settler from England was stabbed to death and his pregnant
American wife seriously wounded today in the West Bank. She lost the
baby as a result of the attack.
Local residents identified the dead man as Daniel Fry, 28, who arrived
from England seven years ago and had lived in the settlement since 1992.
He was said to be from the London area.
His wife was identified as Mara Fry, also 28, a recent immigrant from
Chicago.
Mrs Fry, who had been three months pregnant, was later in stable
condition at Jerusalem's Hadassah Hospital after undergoing surgery for
multiple stab wounds in the right side and arm.
The couple also have a one-year-old daughter who was asleep at home at
the time of the attack and was unhurt.
The radical Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine said it
carried out the attack. The PFLP opposes the Israel-PLO peace deal.
The official PFLP spokesman in Damascus said one of its operatives
''carried out a heroic operation in Maaleh Michmash near Ramallah,
storming the house of a Zionist settler . . . and stabbing him to death
and seriously wounding his wife''.
Settlers' leaders and some Israeli opposition politicians demanded a
halt to the Israel-PLO negotiations on expanding Palestinian self-rule
in the West Bank.
However, Israeli foreign Minister Shimon Peres rejected the demands.
''There was terror before the peace process, and if there will not be
peace, there will be even more terror,'' Peres said on Israel radio.
The Frys live on the outskirts of Maaleh Michmash which, unlike most
settlements, did not have a perimeter fence. Police said Mr Fry heard a
noise and went outside to investigate. He was stabbed to death. When his
wife followed him outside, she was also attacked.
After the attack, troops backed by helicopters searched the area and
imposed a curfew on Arab villages nearby.
Soldiers also set up checkpoints at roads leading to the PLO-ruled
West Bank enclave of Jericho, apparently to prevent the attacker from
seeking refuge there.

A GRANDSON of former Prime Minister Harold Macmillan was declared a

charges of smuggling hashish out of India, government officials said.
Mr Patrick Heath was granted interim bail in February after he was
arrested in June last year for allegedly smuggling about 10lbs of
hashish.
''He was given interim bail after he said his wife was suffering from
a psychological disorder, and he was required to return to court to
answer charges that we will level against him,'' a spokesman said.
''He has been missing since February. The next step is normally to
seal all exits and alert international law enforcement agencies.''
He said requests for Mr Heath's extradition and an international
arrest warrant could be issued shortly.-Reuter

Rwanda, Tuesday
THE country's president today appealed to two million reluctant Hutu
refugees to return home, and promised his government would do its utmost
to protect them from any reprisals for last year's massacre of the
country's Tutsi minority.
President Pasteur Bizimingu issued his appeal before the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Mr Sadako Ogata, who is visiting
Rwanda and neighbouring countries in an effort to push forward the
flagging repatriation programme.
UN officials said Western donors would provide more funds to help the
refugees return home.
''The Rwandan government appeals to all its nationals outside (the
country) not to lose this momentum,'' said Mr Bizimungu, a Hutu in the
mostly Tutsi government which came to power after the Hutu regime, which
orchestrated the genocide, was overthrown in July 1994.
''The government reiterates its determination to do everything
possible to enable the return of Rwandan refugees. No efforts will be
spared to ensure that every Rwandan enjoys equal right to citizenship
and protection by the government.''
Up to two million Hutus are languishing in camps in Zaire, Tanzania,
and Burundi. Most fled after the slaughter of one million Tutsis and
moderate Hutus, fearing the victorious Tutsi-led rebel army would kill
them in revenge.
But their welcome in host countries is wearing thin. Zaire began
forcibly expelling them last month, although later halted the operation,
and Tanzania has hinted it might do the same if they do not start moving
back voluntarily.--Reuter

A BRITISH soldier pled not guilty today to killing his estranged
German wife, who died when a hand grenade exploded as the couple argued
in the bedroom of their German home.
Lance Corporal Phillip Eddowes told a court in Muenster, western
Germany, that his wife Anke had died after a heated row last October
when she told him she wanted to leave him.
However, prosecutors allege Eddowes planned to kill his wife by
detonating the grenade after locking her into the bedroom of the flat in
the town of Osnabruck. He lost an eye and a hand in the blast.
Eddowes, 29, told the court that he reacted badly when his wife told
him she wanted to leave him.
He told her he could not live without her, producing the hand grenade
to make his point. He said a violent argument ensued and, as they
fought, the grenade exploded, killing his wife.
He said he did not know exactly how the grenade had gone off.
The soldier, from the small town of Downham Market in Norfolk, was
testifying on the opening day of his trial.
He told the court he had found the grenade while cleaning out a tank
during the Gulf war.
An interpreter provided simultaneous translations for Eddowes, dressed
in a dark jacket, of the court proceedings.
The soldier faces a prison sentence of between five and 15 years if
found guilty.
Eddowes, who also served in Bosnia, was in the process of leaving the
Army.
However, he was assigned to the 32nd Engineer Regiment near Hanover at
the time of the incident.--Reuter

AN explosion ripped through a market-place today in the capital of
Russia's breakaway Chechnya region. Witnesses said one person was killed
and several were injured.
It was not immediately clear what caused the blast, which occurred a
day before defiant Chechens hoped to celebrate ''Independence Day'', the
fourth anniversary of the region's unilateral declaration of
independence from Moscow.
The blast sent people streaming out of the makeshift market, which has
sprung up in Grozny's shattered centre in the past few days since the
closure of the main central market, reportedly for cleaning.
Witnesses said they believed the explosion was caused by an artillery
shell, although fighting has eased under a shaky ceasefire between
separatist forces and Russian troops sent in last December to smash
Chechnya's campaign for independence.
''I saw one dead person and several others were hurt,'' Ismail Akayev,
a construction worker, told Reuters.
Another man's shirt was covered with blood after he helped take some
of the wounded to hospital.
Several women who had been selling eggs, fruit, and meat said they
believed they had seen an object hurtling through the air before the
blast.
Russian officials did not comment on the incident.
Much of Grozny's centre remains in ruins since heavy fighting,
shelling, and bombing at the start of Russia's intervention.
The rebels have said they will take no action against Russian troops
to mark ''Independence Day''.
However, a representative of the Russian military told Interfax news
agency that rumours of a ''day of vengeance'' were circulating in
Grozny.
Thousands of rebels, Russian soldiers, and civilians have been killed
in seven months of fighting.
Skirmishes have continued since an agreement in late July under which
the rebels are to surrender most of their weapons in return for a
partial Russian withdrawal.
Little progress has been made towards implementing the agreement and
the two sides have yet to begin substantive talks on the region's
future.--Reuter

A POTENTIAL environmental disaster in the River Tweed, one of
Scotland's best fishing waters, has been averted by the release of
millions of gallons of reservoir water into the system.
A report to the Tweed River Purification Board reveals this week that
drought and chemical conditions at the end of last month posed a serious
threat to plant and fish life.
With rainfall at only 11% of the normal August average, levels in some
parts of the river fell to their lowest points since records began. As
water temperatures rose to an abnormal 26[DEG]C the decision was taken
to activate an emergency plan and release more than 300 million gallons
from the Meggett, Talla, and Fruid reservoirs in Tweeddale owned by
Lothian Regional Council.
Mr Ian Currie, board director, said yesterday: ''In our judgment the
dry weather had brought the chemistry of the river to a critical
condition. The extreme sunlight and low river flow had affected the
levels of dissolved oxygen and the whole range of flora and fauna of the
river were at risk. At one point 100 dead salmon were found in one
stretch of the lower Tweed.''
The emergency release -- in addition to smaller routine releases made
earlier -- raised the level of the river by 5.5in.
''This was not done at the expense of domestic water supplies,'' said
Mr Currie. ''Thanks to the wet winter the reservoirs were well
stocked.''
Yesterday nature added its contribution as more characteristic
Scottish rainfall brought the rivers of the Tweed system back into
spate.

THE ingenious eleventh-hour compromise that averted damaging
industrial action by NHS workers was well received yesterday by almost
all parties, most of whom were quick to claim victory in the
six-month-long wrangle over Government attempts to introduce local pay
bargaining.
The only sour note came from the non-TUC Royal College of Nursing,
which did not take part in the talks. The RCN said it was pleased
industrial action had been averted but it felt that the talks did not
involve an agenda for nurses.
''We feel there are still discussions to be held about what is good
for nurses,'' commented a spokeswoman, who denied that the RCN had in
effect been sidelined.
Unison's head of health, Mr Bob Abberley, described the proposals --
which centre on the acceptance of local pay but within a national
framework -- as a real breakthrough that would preserve a national
framework of pay-and-conditions negotiations until after the next
General Election.
He claimed the proposed deal would give health staff the best of both
worlds -- the benefit of being able to increase basic earnings by local
negotiations, with the absolute protection of nationally set pay and
standards below which no-one could fall.
His union's health executive agreed with him, the 40-strong lay body
yesterday voting unanimously to recommend acceptance to Unison's 440,000
NHS members, who are to be balloted over the next few weeks.
He maintains that automatic upgrading of national pay scales to
reflect the outcome of local bargaining effectively establishes a
minimum wage in the NHS while entrenching the independent pay review
bodies at the centre of the negotiating machinery and that the proposals
are ''light years'' away from the Government's original position of last
February.
Mr Ken Jarrold, NHS director of human resources, who devised the
formula along with Mr Abberley, described the settlement as a victory
for the NHS because it gave the green light for local pay in the NHS in
this and subsequent years while removing the spectre of industrial
action.
Health Secretary Stephen Dorrell, whose arrival at the Department of
Health two months ago in succession to Mrs Virgina Bottomley probably
eased the way for a compromise, also welcomed the deal and said it was
an ''important victory'' for the introduction of local pay in the NHS.
''I very much welcome this agreement, which cements local pay
flexibility into the contracts of those NHS staff who are still on
national terms and draws a line under this dispute,'' he said.
Local pay was right for the NHS, said Mr Dorrell, adding that it
supported a modern, flexible NHS that could be more responsive to local
needs and allowed trusts to reward staff fairly for the job they did.
As a result of the proposed agreement all 900,000 NHS staff should
soon receive 1% increases backdated to April 1 plus whatever else can be
negotiated locally.

HARRIET Harman, Shadow Employment Secretary, yesterday attacked the
Government's ''scandalous exploitation'' of almost 100,000 Scots who,
she claimed, earned less than #2.50 an hour, and were forced to work
longer to make ends meet.
In Glasgow to highlight the problems of low pay and unemployment as
part of Labour's low pay consultation exercise, she said 78,000 people
in Scotland earned less than #2.50 an hour, while 19,000 earned less
than #1.50.
Last month's rise in unemployment north of the Border -- up 400 to
198,400 -- also was a ''clear indictment'' of the Tories' failure on
jobs, she said.
Ms Harman argued that Government opposition to the establishment of a
national minimum wage had resulted in ''individual exploitation, social
divisions, and individual taxpayers forking out #100 a year to subsidise
the low paid'', who were forced to claim housing benefit and family
credit.
She claimed the #2400m of benefits claimed by the low-paid had doubled
in the past four years, and would double again unless the Government
fell into line with many other countries by implementing a statutory
minimum wage.
Labour proposes to introduce a national minimum wage, the figure to be
set by a yet-to-be established Low Pay Commission involving employers,
unions, and other interested parties.
It would be based on the experience of the former Wages Councils --
abolished in 1993 -- and minimum wage systems abroad, with the figure
agreed by employers and trade unions and ratified by the Secretary of
State.
Ms Harman argued that it would be wrong to have a situation where the
taxpayer was ''topping up a bottomless pit'', and where employers were
cutting wages and expecting the taxpayer to pick up the bill.
Labour had received an ''interesting response'' from the Scottish
Chambers of Commerce, she said, who had conceded that low pay was a
problem, but who nevertheless opposed a minimum wage.
While the Conservatives and many employers had claimed that a national
minimum wage would cost jobs, she pointed out that similar predictions
over the introduction of equal pay for women had been unfounded.
The abolition of wages councils, intended to create more jobs, also
had the opposite effect.
She said Labour would work with employers and unions to establish a
minimum wage at a ''sensible level'', which would not cost jobs but
would deal with the growing problem of low pay.
However, this offer is unlikely to appease some trade unions and the
STUC, which have backed a call for a minimum wage of #4.15 an hour, and
demand that Labour leader Tony Blair ratifies the figure before the next
General Election.
Ms Harman said the ''sea change'' among the trade union movement
should ensure that there was no insistence that wage differentials were
maintained following the introduction of a minimum wage.
She said the timetables for the Low Pay Commission could not be
determined, although the process would be carried out as ''speedily as
possible'', bearing in mind the practicalities.
''We want the system to last,'' Ms Harman said. ''We are not going to
impose any time limits, but it will be a priority.''
She added: ''Labour believes that economic success for Scotland lies
in it being a hi-tech, high skill economy which competes on quality, not
the Tory vision of a low-tech, low skill, low wage, second class
economy. That is well understood in the successful companies in Scotland
and by Scottish people.''
Mr Lex Gold, director of CBI Scotland, which is opposed to a minimum
wage, said yesterday that Labour was wise not to set a national minimum
level in advance.
However, he warned that figures such as those touted by the STUC of
#4.15 an hour would result in about 110,000 jobs being lost in the UK.
More job cuts would result the higher the level, he said.

A YEAR of ''visual excitement'' costing more than #10m to stage,
estimated to attract 385,000 more visitors to Glasgow in 1996 and create
350 jobs, was promised yesterday in London by Councillor Pat Lally,
leader of Glasgow District Council.
Speaking at the launch of the Glasgow Festival of Visual Arts, which
will run throughout next year, Mr Lally forecast that the event would
bring in an extra #10m in tourist expenditure.
The launch was taking place in London because of the importance of
attracting visitors from London and the South-east if the festival was
to be successful, he added. It would further consolidate Glasgow's
position as the third most popular destination in the United Kingdom for
overseas visitors. Glasgow attracts about 1.2m tourists a year.
The major elements of the festival are:
* The Gallery of Modern Art to be opened in March. Housed in the
former Stirling's Library in Royal Exchange Square, it will have four
exhibition floors devoted to a changing exhibition drawn from a
permanent collection of paintings, many by Scottish artists. Mr Julian
Spalding, director of Glasgow Museums, said they had looked for art that
was ''beautiful, funny, serious or sad, art that was made by people for
people''. The gallery's four floors -- fire, earth, water, and air --
have a different character intended to enhance the works on display, and
at the top of the building will be a ''love nest'' cafe painted by
Adrian Wisznieski.
* The largest ever Charles Rennie Mackintosh exhibition, which runs
from May to September before going on tour in the United States, will be
held in the McLellan Galleries. Among the 300 exhibits will be the
restored White Dining Room from the Ingram Street Tea Rooms held in
store by Glasgow Museums. It is the first time the room, complete with
furniture and light fittings, will have been on show. The exhibition
marks the centenary of Mackintosh's greatest building, Glasgow School of
Art. The former Glasgow Herald building in Buchanan Street will be among
other Mackintosh buildings open to visitors.
* The International Festival of Design. This is intended to further
the role of the 570 design companies operating in Glasgow. The
exhibition, to be housed in a marquee in George Square, opens in
September. However, there will be a visual arts fair held in the tent in
April.
A pageant through the city celebrating the work of Scottish women
artists, including Margaret MacDonald Mackintosh and Joan Eardley, will
be held in May.
Among the supporting attractions will be art exhibitions in shopping
centres, hotels, and pedestrian precincts. Mayfest, the Jazz Festival,
Glasgow Film Theatre and Strathclyde University, which is celebrating
its bicentenary, will be staging special events.
Mr Lally said more than 70 applications had been received for
assistance from the #100,000 projects fund set up by Glasgow District
Council and the Scottish Arts Council. The winners will be announced
next month.
Mr Stuart Gulliver, chief executive of Glasgow Development Agency, one
of the main sponsors, said the festival ''would have a direct impact on
jobs and wealth creation''.

ORKNEY Young Farmers' clubs yesterday expressed surprise over
allegations of cheating at a stock-judging contest.
Officials are carrying out an investigation and want to question one
of the judges at the event over claims that the team that won the
stock-judging competition had insider information.
The contest was part of the islands' annual Young Farmers' rally, held
last month at St Andrew's school, Toab.
Five judges appointed by the Orkney district association of Young
Farmers' clubs looked over eight classes of livestock -- three of sheep,
three of beef cattle, and two of dairy cattle. Their verdicts on the
animals' quality were marked down.
About 80 young farmers from the four Orkney clubs -- Sandwick, Harray,
East Mainland, and Deerness -- then judged the animals as individuals
and in teams.
One of two Harray teams won the contest. It is understood that the
district association is now investigating claims that a judge may have
passed on information to Harray club members.
An emergency meeting has been called for Wednesday of next week, when
officials will want to question the man concerned.
Already a senior official from the Harray club has offered his
resignation. Assistant club leader Mr Alick Slater, of Yarpha, Orphir,
said yesterday: ''I can confirm that I have resigned my post. I don't
want to comment further until after the meeting.''
The judge believed to be at the centre of the allegations, Mr Kevin
Harvey, was abroad and not available for comment.

THE proposed closure of RAF Turnhouse, Edinburgh, was announced
yesterday by the Ministry of Defence, and immediately prompted
speculation over the site being developed commercially.
The closure of the base -- by April 1 next year -- is subject to
consultation with trade unions. The RAF said, however, that the site
offered considerable scope for commercial development.
The RAF suggested that the local development agency, Lothian and
Edinburgh Enterprise Ltd, could play an important role in providing
assistance.
Later, Dr Des Bonnar, the agency's chief executive, said that the base
commander's office had been contacted to set up a meeting to discuss the
situation.
The RAF said that the future of RAF Turnhouse had been under review
for some time. It had had no peacetime operational role since 1970, when
the airfield was handed over to the then British Airports Authority.
A Defence Ministry spokesman said the 135 RAF members would be posted
to other stations, and the 34 civilians offered alternative posts or
redundancy.

THE Princess Royal is to represent the Queen at next year's General
Assembly of the Church of Scotland -- the third year running that there
will have been a woman High Commissioner to the Kirk's supreme court.
With the Queen's approval, the Princess has been appointed Lord High
Commissioner to the General Assembly. The post is now known as Her
Majesty's High Commissioner, in recognition of the fact that a woman can
occupy it.
The Princess, Colonel-in-Chief of the Royal Scots and also patron of
the Scottish Rugby Union, will be the first member of the royal family
to attend the Assembly since the Queen herself in 1977.
Last night, a Church of Scotland spokesman said: ''I am sure everyone
in the church will welcome this appointment most warmly.''
The Princess Royal will be only the third female High Commissioner.
She follows former Labour MP Miss Margaret Herbison in 1970 and Lady
Marion Fraser last year.
The last member of the royal family to be Lord High Commissioner was
the late Duke of Gloucester in 1963.
* The Bishop of Stepney, the Right Rev Richard Chartres was yesterday
appointed Bishop of London. He is an opponent of women priests. His
appointment means that two of the top three posts in the Church of
England will be occupied by traditionalists opposed to the ordination of
women.

DEADLY food poisoning, the slow march of Aids, and the scourge of
illicit drug use lurked behind the news yesterday that Scotland was
starting to shake off its label as the Sick Man of Europe.
The Chief Medical Officer, Dr Robert Kendell, was able to announce in
his annual report that the traditional diseases that have dogged the
Scots -- heart disease and cancer -- were starting to decline.
He warned, however, that further measures may be needed to improve
some of the intractable problems, like tooth decay in children and
smoking by young people.
Accompanying this was a worrying picture of some of the diseases which
threaten to hound Scotland into the twenty-first century, including the
deadly strain of food poisoning which caused last year's outbreak in
West Lothian, the continued increase in sexually transmitted HIV, and
the discovery that illicit drug use was ubiquitous in rural, as well as
urban, areas.
Dr Kendell said: ''Scottish women have the lowest life expectancy in
western Europe.'' Men, he said, had the next lowest behind the
Portuguese and possibly the Finns, but were catching up.
Expectation of life at birth rose slightly to 72.1 years in men and
77.6 years in women, compared with Japan, the healthiest country in the
world with the longest life expectancy -- 76.3 years for men and 83
years for women.
The findings:
* Heart disease -- There were 1799 deaths from heart attacks below the
age of 65, compared with 2118 in 1993, a reduction of 15%. Dr Kendell
said deaths from coronary heart disease had been falling for 15 years,
but the fall was accelerating.
''My personal view, of the target of a 40% reduction in heart disease
deaths between 1990 and 2000, was that it was over-ambitious, but it
looks as if it is going to be met. We are more or less on target,'' he
said.
Part of the reduction, he added, was due to medical advances and
increasing overall prosperity, but a substantial part was a result of
people becoming more health conscious.
* HIV and Aids -- In some respects, the situation was getting worse,
with the death toll now at 429. Last year's 100 deaths, and the 125
patients registered as suffering from Aids, were the highest ever annual
figures in each case.
''These are human tragedies, mostly involving young adults,'' he said.
The 138 new HIV infections recorded last year, brought the cumulative
total to 2209.
Although one of the main sources of infection, intravenous drugs
misuse, had shown a sharp drop -- ''a remarkable tribute to the success
of our needle exchange and methadone programmes, which we would not have
dared predict in the 1980s'' -- the overall trend in numbers infected
was creeping up.
''New infections arising from homosexual and heterosexual intercourse
are rising slowly. What we are faced with is not some terrible epidemic
between now and the end of the century, but a substantial long-term
threat that this infection will slowly spread into the bulk of the
population.''
* Food poisoning -- The instances have been rising steadily for a
number of years, partly as a result of improved detection, but also in
real terms, said Dr Kendell.
He blamed intensive rearing methods for permitting the easy spread of
infection, and carelessness in food storing and preparation, both by
large-scale commercial concerns and in the domestic kitchen.
He highlighted the deadly organism that caused the West Lothian food
poisoning outbreak last year, for which Scotland has one of the highest
rates in the world.
''The most worrying trend is the increase in E-coli, and in particular
the strain known as 0157 -- implicated in the West Lothian outbreak --
which produces a toxin that attacks the red blood cells,'' he said.
''This particular strain may be a new organism. It was first
identified in Canada in the 1980s. It is sometimes lethal and can cause
serious kidney damage.''
Last year there were 242 cases in five different outbreaks of 0157,
and the incidence is higher in Scotland than in other parts of the UK.
It is more common in the east of the country than the west, and it is
only recently that it has been possible to link it conclusively with
cattle, making milk and meat -- particularly mince -- the likeliest
source.
* Cancer -- Deaths of men below the age of 65 fell from 2203 in 1993,
to 2104 in 1994, a drop of 4%, but rose marginally in women, from 2041
to 2047.
The main cause of this gender difference is almost certainly the much
greater reduction in smoking by men than by women in the last 20 years.
* Drug misuse -- Seventeen per cent of respondents in a survey of
those between the ages of 16 and 59 admitted using a controlled drug at
some time in their lives, and 6% had used cannabis in the past year,
with little difference between urban and rural areas. There were 247
drug deaths in 1994 (excluding suicides), a much higher figure than in
any previous year.
More encouraging, the infant mortality rate (deaths in the first year
of life) was 6.2 per 1000 live births, and the neonatal mortality rate
(deaths in the first 28 days of life) was 4 per 1000 live births, both
record lows. A major contributor was the fall in cot deaths.
There was also a 13% reduction in deaths from road accidents, and a
new low of 88 deaths in fires, which Dr Kendell attributed to the use of
smoke alarms.

A QUIET islander, whose cannabis-growing operation was said to be so
amateurish it could have come from Tales of Para Handy, was jailed for a
year yesterday.
Robert McGillivray, 45, cultivated his cannabis crop in a greenhouse
that also housed tomatoes and was partly made out of car windscreens.
His younger brother Kenneth, 41, who also admitted drugs offences,
will be able to return to the island of Mull after a judge ordered him
to carry out the maximum period of 240 hours of community service.
Both brothers admitted producing cannabis on Mull between January and
July last year. Robert McGillivray also admitted possessing it with
intent to supply.
The brothers, who live in caravans at Airds Croft, Pennyghael, Mull,
were caught after police discovered the cannabis plants on July 14 last
year following a tip-off.
Robert McGillivray had 105 plants in his makeshift greenhouse and a
further 17 in his garden. His younger brother had 17 plants.
Lord Cowie was told that Robert McGillivray used the drug for
medicinal reasons and gave away what he did not need for his own use.
Mr Ian Sharpe, counsel for the older brother, described his client as
a quiet man of humble means whose lifestyle was characterised by a love
of the land and a need for solitude.
Robert McGillivray had been surprised at how many of the cannabis
seeds had developed into plants, given the conditions on the island.
''He planted these seeds thinking that if even a few grew he would be
happy with his lot,'' added Mr Sharpe.
He pointed out that the cannabis had been cultivated without any of
the hi-tech aids sometimes found in drug cases.
''One doesn't want to draw analogies with Tales of Para Handy, but one
couldn't have gone about it in a more amateurish fashion than Mr
MacGillivray.''
Lord Cowie was told that Robert McGillivray was highly regarded on
Mull and islanders had written letters asking the court to show
leniency.
The court also heard that Kenneth McGillivray, the younger brother,
lived like a hermit and had grown the plants for his own use.
Lord Cowie told Robert McGillivray: ''I accept that there was unlikely
to be any financial gain for you in this situation, but this is a matter
which is of a very serious nature indeed. I have decided that a short
term of imprisonment is what you must undergo.''
In Kenneth McGillivray's case the judge said he felt able to avoid
sending him to prison because a smaller amount of the drug was involved
and it was for his own use.

PLANS to establish a rock climbing centre on the outskirts of Aberdeen
have been given #675,000 from by the national lottery.
The Sports Council announced that Granite Rock, which will be built at
Westhill Business Park, is to receive one of the largest amounts yet
allocated to a Scottish sports facility.
The #1.5m centre will have more than 1500 square metres of art
climbing walls, including an international standard competition wall 16
metres high.
There will also be a cafeteria, creche, injury clinic, and gymnasium,
and it will create around 14 jobs. It will include a rock climbing and
mountaineering school.
The centre is the idea of climber John Ashbridge, Granite Rock's
managing director, who said: ''Rock climbing is the UK's fastest growing
sport and there is an increasing demand for indoor rock climbing
facilities. This will be a valuable resource for climbers to perfect
their technique and test their skills.''
The lottery funding is providing 45% of the capital cost. The
remainder is expected to be raised through loans and private investment.
The second biggest award -- #670,000 -- goes towards upgrading the
athletics and rugby facilities at the Scotstoun Leisure Centre in
Glasgow.
In other awards #600,000 has been given to help build the Strathearn
Recreation Centre in Crieff.
Some #500,000 will go towards the completion of the Centrum Ice Arena
in Prestwick.
Ayr Cricket Club is to receive #239,000 to help build an eight-acre
sports facility, Nairn Dunbar Golf Club gets #205,000 to build a new
clubhouse, while #100,000 has been earmarked for a sports wing as part
of a community social club being constructed by Wester Hailes Civic and
Leisure Trust in Edinburgh.

AN MP yesterday called for an inquiry into allegations of conflict of
interest involving the Morrison construction group and its chairman, Mr
Fraser Morrison.
Mr Calum Macdonald, the Labour MP for the Western Isles, said a full
inquiry was necessary to avoid damage to the institutions involved.
Recent reports suggested the Edinburgh-based group had a head start in
bidding for the #2m contract to build a new North of Scotland Water
Authority HQ at Inverness.
Mr Morrison is also chairman of Highlands and Islands Enterprise
which, it was alleged, provided details of a Morrison company as a firm
which could do the work ahead of other bidders. Mr Morrison has denied
any impropriety.
The water authority chairman is Mr John Robertson, also a member of
HIE's board.
Mr Macdonald said: ''The Conservative Government's practice of
stuffing quangos with its favourite businessmen has inevitably led to
fears of conflict of interest arising. These reports can only exacerbate
and undermine public confidence in Government appointees to public
bodies.''
He said that for confidence to be restored the Scottish Office should
set up an inquiry, which should be made public.
Last month Scottish Industry Minister George Kynoch cleared the group
of any suggestion that it had had an improper advantage over proposals
to build the new water authority headquarters.

<HEADLINE>Protests after dismissal by trust. 'Witch-hunt' claim over sacked doctor</HEADLINE>

TWO doctors are fighting to clear their names after what has been
described as a witch-hunt.
Colleagues say they are ''deeply concerned'' about the cases of Dr
David Clow and Dr David Breen, both of Dumfries.
Dr Clow, a consultant paediatrician of Dumfries and Galloway Community
Health Trust, was dismissed after a disciplinary hearing behind closed
doors.
He was said to have harassed colleagues, used threatening behaviour,
breached protocol and failed to adhere to a written warning.
He strongly denies all the accusations and is appealing through the
British Medical Association to Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth on the
grounds of unfair dismissal.
Dr Clow, 53, who has worked in Dumfries for almost 20 years, said: ''I
consider I have been treated very unjustly and I am determined to clear
my name.''
Dr Breen, a consultant in public health medicine with the regional
health board, is facing disciplinary measures for refusing to hand over
Dr Clow's personal medical file to Mr Derek Banks, the health board's
general manager.
Dr Breen is adamant he has done nothing wrong and has appealed. He
expects to hear the result tomorrow.
The cases have been discussed by the area medical committee, and the
GPs' sub- committee, and a question is expected to be asked at
tomorrow's regional health board meeting.
The GPs' spokesman, Dr Peter Wilkinson, said: ''We are unanimously of
the view that Dr Clow's clinical ability is not in question and he is
held in high regard.''
Consultant surgeon Andrew Walls, chairman of the medical committee,
said: ''There is great disquiet among consultants and GPs about recent
events. There has been a lot of rumour and innuendo, and we hope
specific facts are now going to emerge.''
However, a health board source said: ''Some of us believe there has
been a witch-hunt against Dr Clow. He is the sort of person who says
exactly what he believes.''
The series of events began early last year at Mountainhall Children's
Centre in Dumfries, where Dr Clow worked for part of each week.
He alleges a doctor accused him of suffering from mental illness due
to stress. He admits he lost patience.
In May 1994, the incident was considered by Dr Iain MacLean, chief
administrative medical officer, who decided to take no action.
However, there followed a series of complaints against Dr Clow by some
of the Mountainhall staff, who, he claimed, were conspiring against him.
They accused him of bizarre behaviour, giving contrary advice to
patients and their parents, erratic time-keeping, and other
misdemeanours.
As a result, Dr Clow went off work, pending an investigation by the
director of occupational health, Dr Colin Jamieson, and a check-up by
his GP. He was given a clear bill of health and after a holiday returned
to work.
However, on his return, trouble again flared at Mountainhall over a
boy patient's case notes. His parents complained about a breach of
confidentiality and Dr Clow took their complaint to the board general
manager.
He was accused of breaching protocol and last December was given a
written warning. It was claimed he failed to adhere to this warning.
This and other complaints led to his disciplinary hearing in July this
year.
In a letter of dismissal, Elizabeth Edwards, Community Health Trust
chairman, said the trust had rejected Dr Clow's suggestion of a
conspiracy against him.
A spokeswoman for the community trust said yesterday: ''Dr Clow's
contract with the trust has been terminated on grounds of personal
conduct.''

A BRILLIANT law student from Bosnia is set for a career in Scotland
after graduating from Edinburgh University.
Almira Delibegovic, 24, finished top of her class of 90, gaining a
first class honours LL B earlier this year. After a summer job working
for the Scottish Law Commission, she will now study for her law diploma,
which will enable her to practise law.
Yesterday she received sponsorship from the Clarke Foundation at the
Edinburgh offices of the law firm Tods Murray -- which was involved in
the establishment of the trust -- to see her through the next 12 months.
Ms Delibegovic has already secured a traineeship with another
Edinburgh firm, McGrigor Donald, where she will specialise in company
law, in the hope of one day pursuing her ambition of practising in her
homeland.
''I have chosen company law because in my country it is not really
developed at all,'' she said. ''I thought we were bound to have
something which is transferable. I also like it.''
Ms Delibegovic, from Tuzla, was taking part in the Scottish University
Summer School in 1992 when the war broke out in her homeland. She had
been a law and English student in Sarajevo.
she was encouraged to remain in Scotland and bursaries were secured
for her at Edinburgh University, along with financial help from two law
firms in the city, to fund her studies.
A spokesman for the university described her as ''a star student''.
She is still regularly in touch by telephone with her parents, Enver
and Izabeta. Her 18-year-old sister, Mirela, came to Scotland last year
to complete her schooling in safety.
''My experience of Scotland is marvellous,'' she said. ''I've met so
many nice people. It's been wonderful.''

A SENIOR Glasgow Conservative, Bailie John Young, has complained
bitterly about ''many thousands of pounds'' having to be spent by the
new unitary authority on changes to the city's coat of arms.
The Lord Lyon King of Arms has advised that the City of Glasgow
Council, which assumes power next April, is a new entity and therefore
should have new armorial insignia.
Out go the present coronet of thistles, to be replaced by a
distinctive gold mural coronet, representing the ancient walls of a
city. The other emblems -- the fish, the bird, the tree, and the bell --
used in seals dating back to the thirteenth and fourteenth century, are
retained.
This ''mural coronet'' has been proposed by the Lord Lyon as a common
feature in the different arms of the four city councils in Scotland
after next April, although Bailie Young claims Glasgow never was a
walled city.
Having approved the change at a full council meeting yesterday, the
new authority will have to fork out a #579 fee to the Lord Lyon, who
will issue letters patent confirming arms to the new authority.
However, the change raises the propect of wide-ranging expenditure on
altering vehicle liveries, notice boards, furniture, letterheads,
business cards, and advertisements.
Bailie Young observed: ''I'm not saying coats of arms should not be
registered. Obviously they should be. But for the Lord Lyon to be able
to step in and demand that we make changes costing hundreds of thousands
of pounds is farcical.
''I tried to persuade councillors, at the earlier committee stage, to
defy the Lord Lyon and say that we are not prepared to change our coat
of arms, but I got no support from the other parties.
''The official attitude was that this was a relatively small amount of
money in global terms.''
A council spokesman said it was important that the new authority, with
its new role and new responsibilities, should have a clear identity to
avoid confusion in the minds of the public.

<HEADLINE>British Gas puts 15% on service costs and blames rivals</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>CAMERON SIMPSON</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>976519439</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Gas came in for fierce criticism last night after it raised
the price of service contracts and repairs by an average 10%. In
Scotland the average rise will be 15% -- an increase of almost five
times the rate of inflation.
North of the Border the cost of a top grade ''Three Star'' contract
will rise 14.9% from #78.20 to #89.88. In most of England and Wales the
increase will be 9.4%, from #84.95 to #93.
People who have opted for one of the three cheaper contracts face
increases of around #7 a year.
The move, which will affect three million domestic gas users in
Britain from October 7, was condemned by consumer groups as unfair and
unnecessary. Labour criticised the Government for failing to heed
warnings that price rises were on the way.
The Scottish manager of the Gas Consumers Council, Mr Euan Robson,
said Scotland had enjoyed lower prices in the past when they were set by
the old regional directors.
However, with centralisation taking decision-making out of their hands
it meant that Scotland would have to make a 15% leap to come into line
with the new charges for the rest of Britain.
The ''bad news for consumers'' came against a background of higher
complaint levels, Mr Robson said. ''The service is not getting better.
This year we have had more complaints in the first seven months than we
had for the whole of last year.''
Mr Robson also expressed the fear that some people would be deterred
from taking out service contracts and that as a result ''safety problems
will not be uncovered''.
He added: ''About six to nine months ago we feared the increases would
be about 30%. However, I think this is what is going to happen. We are
going to get more increases.''
British Gas chiefs, however, said they were faced with huge
competition from outside firms and had to increase prices to compete.
Mr David Wells, managing director of the service division, said: ''We
aim to be the best, not the cheapest. We are totally committed to
providing the very best service but we cannot do so at current prices.''
It is the latest in a series of controversial moves by the company,
which made a pre-tax profit of #1233m last ear.
It has come under fire over profits, bosses' pay, cutting jobs,
reducing showroom services, and slashing spending on safety checks.
British Gas says most people will be able to cope with the increases,
which are necessary because of the pressure being applied by more than
50,000 rival gas appliance repair firms or providers.
''This is a highly competitive market where customers have increasing
choice,'' said David Wells.
''Research demonstrates that the vast majority of our customers want a
quality service representing value for money. We aim to offer our
customers the very highest standards at a realistic price.''
Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown said he could not see how such
increases were justified.
He said: ''The Government has failed to tackle the boardroom excesses
of British Gas and we are doing nothing to stop these price rises.''
Mr Phil Hamer, Gas Consumers Council field director, said that by
asking to be treated as ''just another firm'' British Gas was in danger
of losing its ''Bank-of-England reputation'' and damaging the industry.
''We get the impression that British Gas no longer wants to be treated
as 'the old British Gas','' he said.
''And if that is true they are making a big mistake because if there
are more leaks or more explosions and people believe that gas is not
safe then the whole industry will suffer.''
The GCC said it was surprised by the size of the price rises. The
Consumers' Association and National Consumer Council were also critical.
But Labour MP Peter Hain said he had warned Trade and Industry
Minister Tim Eggar five months ago that British Gas was going to make
''massive'' increases in the cost of service contracts.
He said: ''But when I raised the prospect in a Commons committee, Mr
Eggar pooh-poohed it as scaremongering.''

THE Government's published target of selling 51% of British Rail's
passenger services by next April lies in tatters.
Documents in the hands of Transport Secretary Sir George Young suggest
it will be fortunate if three train operating companies -- let alone 13
-- are in private hands by then.
Leaked material, based on a briefing paper by the Office of Passenger
Rail Franchising, which is responsible for the sale process, reveals
that:
* Bids to run the first three networks put out to tender -- Great
Western, South West Trains, and LTS (London Tilbury and Southend) --
reflect ''an immature understanding of the businesses''.
* The second tranche of invitations, due on September 27, are now
''subject to a review of market sentiment''.
* ScotRail's invitation to tender, originally scheduled for this
month, is postponed until the spring -- and could be off next year's
agenda completely.
* British Rail has deep concerns over implications the targets will
have on its resources, which, in turn, could ''impact on other
privatisation activities''.
All these warnings were prepared even before it was announced that the
West Coast main line would not now be sold this side of a General
Election.
Since then, Opraf has issued assurances that sales are proceeding as
planned, and that there is no change to the Government's published
targets.
The sale of more than half the 25 train operating companies under the
break-up of BR is crucial to the Government's privatisation programme.
However, Labour's Scottish transport spokesman, Mr Henry McLeish, last
night described the material as ''a humiliation''. He said it clearly
showed the target of having 13 train operators in private hands by April
was ''simply ludicrous''.
Railway industry experts have predicted that if the disarray were as
severe as suggested, a Labour Government would probably renationalise
train operators if only a handful were in the private sector after the
election.
They said Labour would be able to argue it was an expensive folly to
have a two-tier railway system -- and also point to an electorate
backing its policy of a State-controlled, publicly accountable,
integrated rail network.
Sir George has been told that interest from bidders for the first
three franchises was ''serious'', but ''of variable quality, which
reflected bidders immature understanding of the businesses concerned''.
In fact, bidders don't even know what they are purchasing -- and how
they should pitch levels of interest, according to sources.
Opraf, aiming to shortlist interested parties later this month, has
argued in private that firmer bids could not be expected at this stage
because of the ''the contractual matrix'' involved.
But it has also warned that issues -- especially on performance,
rolling stock, and length of franchise terms -- would arise once
''bidders were further advanced up the learning curve''.
The Opraf material also suggests that agreements between train
operators and Railtrack, responsible for infrastructure, is hitting
problems.
It was conceded that train operators might not necessarily have to
agree long-term leases with Railtrack for administration offices.
Instead, some leases -- ''for best value for money reasons'' -- could
remain in the hands of the Government, with BR's Property Board acting
as agent.
Despite the troubles, the leaked material underlines that invitations
to tender will go out.
Preparations for the ScotRail franchise will continue, but no target
date is given.
Mr McLeish said the programme, as scheduled, meant that just three
train operators could be in the private sector by April. He added:
''Even that may not be possible.''
Meanwhile, campaigners for the West Coast main line will meet
Transport Minister John Watts on Monday to discuss the crisis which has
hit plans for a #1700m modernisation of Britain's most heavily used
railway system, writes Benedict Brogan.
Last week, the line's sale was indefinitely postponed after potential
investors expressed concern over uncertainty surrounding the
Government's promised upgrade of track, signalling, and rolling stock.
The all-party West Coast Rail 250 pressure group, in advance of
meeting Mr Watts, yesterday published findings of a three-month study of
the line which concluded that the upgrading package remained ''uncertain
and insecure''.
Services on Scotland's busiest commuter route, between Glasgow and
Edinburgh, were disrupted over a five-hour period yesterday as
engineeers worked to repair a cable fault at Newbridge, near Edinburgh.
It resulted in trains running between 15 and 20 minutes late.

ACTOR Sean Connery, who joined the ranks of the OAPs last month,
yesterday showed he is still capable of a mean game of golf.
Looking tanned and fit, the screen superstar was in St Andrews to take
part in the first round of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club's Calcutta
Cup foursomes competition over the New Course.
Partnered by fellow actor Michael Medwin, he made the next round of
the competition with a 4 and 3 victory over the father and son pairing
of Tom and Peter Forster.
Connery is taking part in the R&amp;A's three-week Autumn Meeting while
taking a break from filming. In recent years he has been a regular
competitor at the meeting, which involves the Calcutta Cup foursomes
event, the Queen Victoria Jubilee Vase next week, then the Autumn Medal
meeting.
The Scottish star has twice won the Vase, an individual knock-out
event, in 1987 and 1991. He also won the Calcutta Cup in 1973 when
partnered by Sir Iain Stewart.

THE Scottish National Party yesterday published a new financial
document which, using the Government's own statistics, it claimed proved
an independent Scotland would be economically viable.
The party's opponents dismissed the document as ''a fantasy budget''
and ''sleight of hand'', but the SNP challenged Labour, the Tories and
the Liberal Democrats to produce comparable figures and enter the
debate.
Party spokesman John Swinney said its calculations, based on
Government statistics and advice from the Commons library, showed that,
in terms of State expenditure and revenue, Scotland could enjoy a #200m
annual surplus.
He said: ''Our calculations show that Scotland contributes more than
her pro-rata share in terms of Exchequer receipts. This report destroys
the myth that Scotland is somehow a subsidised nation within the UK. It
shows that Scotland more than pays her way.
''With independence in Europe, Scotland's abundant resources could be
put to work in the Scottish interest, enabling us to build a strong and
prosperous economy.
''Scotland is the 21st richest country in the world, and is well able
to stand on her own two feet. It is both an insult and a nonsense for
the SNP's Unionist opponents to pretend that Scots are somehow incapable
of sustaining the perfectly normal status of independence in Europe, and
thriving.''
Mr Swinney conceded that, in the past, the SNP had not provided such a
detailed document in support of its policy, but said it -- and two
others expected soon -- would form a central part of a large public
campaign later this year.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson commented: ''These are just
amateur figures from an amateur party. It is . . . Fantasy Politics.''
Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Jim Wallace said: ''The figures in
this document smack of sleight of hand. The issue is not whether
statistics can be manufactured to show one thing or another, but what
kind of constitutional change the Scottish people actually want: home
rule, not independence.''
The Herald asked the Scottish Conservative Party to reply to the SNP
document, but officials in Edinburgh were unable to provide a response.
* Labour leader Tony Blair's commitment to a Scottish parliament
amounts to no more than a Caledonia Regional Council, Scottish Secretary
Michael Forsyth claimed yesterday.
Rounding on Mr Blair's devolution pledge, reinforced in an interview
yesterday, Mr Forsyth said: ''Where he really let the cat out of the bag
is in comparing the funding of a Scottish parliament with that of local
government.''

BRITISH Harrier jump-jets and armoured fighting vehicles blasted
Bosnian Serb positions as Nato's patience finally snapped yesterday.
Four Royal Navy Sea Harriers from the carrier HMS Invincible in the
Adriatic and three RAF Harriers from Gioia del Colle, southern Italy,
attacked ammunition dumps and other targets with 1000lb laser-guided
bombs.
Two Warrior armoured vehicles ''neutralised'' a Serb mortar on Mount
Igman with their 30mm cannons as it was preparing to fire, United
Nations officials said.
Defence Secretary Michael Portillo warned that the strikes would
continue until the Serbs fully complied with demands to withdraw heavy
weapons from the 12-mile exclusion zone around Sarajevo and guarantee
the safety of all the UN-declared safe areas.
However, defiant Serbian forces last night fired eight shells into
Sarajevo A boy lost his leg in the barrage. French gunners of the UN
Rapid Reaction Force later fired a salvo at a Bosnian Serb artillery
position.
Earlier, Bosnian Serb army commander General Ratko Mladic warned the
UN that his forces would hit back.
''If you bomb us, we will defend ourselves,'' he said.
The bombing raids by a dozen allied nations ended a tense 14-hour wait
to see whether the Bosnian Serbs would bow to demands and move their
tanks, artillery and mortars out of range of Sarajevo.
It was clear that the UN and Nato gradually had lost patience with the
Bosnian Serbs as they played a dangerous game of brinkmanship.
Group Captain Graham Cullington, RAF detachment commander,said the
Harriers' bombs were dropped successfully on ammunition dumps in Bosnia.
''They hit their targets in a successful mission,'' he said.
A second wave of three Harriers and a Jaguar had to turn back without
dropping their weapons as the weather closed in.
Group Captain Cullington said: ''The first attack sortie was very
successful, the second hampered by the weather.
''The equipment is working very well, the crews are performing
extremely well, we could gear up even more if we needed to.''
Asked how long they could carry on the operation if need be, he said:
''The aircraft are all serviceable, the crews are being rested where
possible, and we could continue almost indefinitely.''
The Prime Minister threw his full support behind the decision to
resume air strikes.
He said: ''The Bosnian Serbs were well aware of what they needed to do
to avoid a resumption of bombing by UN/Nato forces.
''They were given an opportunity which they failed to take. The
Bosnian Serbs cannot now be surprised at the consequences.''
However, Russia, the Serbs' historic Orthodox and Slavic ally,
condemned what it called ''punitive'' strikes which put Nato on one side
in the conflict with those trying to defeat the Serbs.
''We decisively condemn the military actions by Nato and demand their
cessation,'' Moscow's Foreign Ministry said in a statement, which said
the attacks had come despite ''broadly positive'' Serb replies to UN
demands to lift the siege.
In Belgrade, US envoy Richard Holbrooke pushed on with the diplomatic
arm of his strategy in talks with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic
-- their second lengthy meeting this week.
The Bosnian Serbs last week formalised Milosevic's central
power-broking role, giving him the right to speak for them.
Mr Holbrooke is trying to thrash out the ground for Friday's proposed
meeting in Geneva of the foreign ministers of Bosnia, Croatia, and
Yugoslavia intended to prepare the way for peace talks on the basis of
plans laid down by the five major world powers.

THE chairman of Shell UK, Dr Chris Fay, today will meet Greenpeace
chief executive Lord Melchett in an attempt to find common ground over
the disposal of the Brent Spar.
The meeting was arranged some time ago, but now follows a Greenpeace
admission that its calculations of the pollution risk posed by the
installation were wrong.
During the protest against the dumping of Brent Spar in the Atlantic,
Greenpeace claimed there were 5500 tons of oil still in the Spar's
storage tanks. Lord Melchett now concedes the sample results were wrong
and there was no oil on board in substantial quantities.
In a letter to Dr Fay, Lord Melchett apologised for its error but said
scientists had also now shown there were fundamental flaws in the
arguments Shell put forward to the public and the Government justifying
its decision to dump the installation.
Shell eventually had to back down because of the public unrest it
caused, particularly in Europe.
The structure is now anchored in a Norwegian fjord.
An independent audit of the contents of Brent Spar is being carried
out and the results will be available next month.
However, Dr Fay said more than 200 suggestions for Brent Spar's
disposal had been put forward and each would have to be fully analysed
and appraised and it was likely to be late next year before that was
complete.
In his letter of apology, Lord Melchett said their error had arisen
because oil they thought had come from a storage tank had in fact come
from a vent pipe.
In the opening address at the Offshore Europe exhibition and
conference in Aberdeen yesterday, Dr Fay criticised environmentalists
for assuming they were the only people interested in safeguarding the
future and said it was wrong of them to think that those who worked in
business had less worthy, short-term motives.
''Just because we put on business suits or hard hats to go to work
doesn't mean we cease to be normal people with normal concerns,'' he
said.
''In fact, because we travel widely and work on long term projects,
people in this industry think a great deal about the state of the
world.''
He said the offshore oil and gas industry had always known it had a
duty to deal properly with its installations when they were no longer
required and international guidelines had been developed which meant all
shallow water structures -- 75% of those on the UK Continental Shelf --
would be removed.
For the smaller number of much bigger and heavier deep water
installations, a case-by-case consideration of the appropriate balance
between environmental, safety and economic factors had been agreed as
the international standard.
''Such analysis could favour leaving the bases of structures in the
sea. Refloating concrete caissons may be difficult and could pose
considerable environmental risks.
''There is little logic to removing clean steel jackets which could
play such a beneficial role in rejuvenating fish stocks as is done with
platforms in the United States.''
He added: ''Costs have to be taken into account -- the notion that
they can be ignored is unsustainable.''
Dr Fay said at his meeting with Lord Melchett he would by trying to
find a common line on which they could move forward, just as he would
with everyone he consulted with.
* Five tugs were called out to assist a fully-laden oil tanker broken
down in Yell Sound, Shetland, yesterday . The single main engine of the
Portuguese tanker Erati failed soon after she left the Sullom Voe
terminal with 139,000 tonnes of oil for the US.
The Erati was moored to loading jetty number two at Sullom Voe while
an investigation began into the cause of the incident.

KVAERNER Govan has launched itself into the space age with a #60m
order that will secure the 1200 jobs at the yard well into 1997. The
good news was announced yesterday as part of a #110m contract won by the
Norwegian parent company.
The Glasgow yard, which last month shed 93 jobs through voluntary
redundancy, will build the roll-on, roll-off support ship and control
centre for the launch at sea of commercial satellites.
The company's yard at Stavanger will convert a semi-submersible oil
rig into a mobile launchpad for the satellites at a cost of #50m as part
of the Sea Launch project involving the United States, Russia and the
Ukraine.
The Govan part of the contract has to be completed for launch by May,
1997, before it sails for Russia to be fitted out with the hi-tech
equipment needed for space launches.
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth said: ''I am delighted at Kvaerner
Govan's success. This is good news for the company, for Govan, and for
Scotland's shipbuilding industry. Much credit must go to the company for
putting together a competitive bid and fighting its corner so
effectively in what was a tough negotiation.''
The plan to launch satellites from a platform in the Pacific Ocean
includes the US Boeing Aircraft group, Russia's RSC Energia space
company, and Ukrainian rocket manufacturer NPO Yuzhnoye. The vessel
being built at Govan will transport rockets and satellites to the launch
site.

MOTORISTS in Central Scotland and North-east England are likely to
benefit from what could be a protracted price battle involving some of
Britain's largest petrol retailers.
Prices have dropped by an average of 30p a gallon -- from 51.5p-59.9p
a litre to 49.9p-54.9p a litre -- at many filling stations in recent
weeks.
The downward price trend, which has been welcomed by motoring
organisations, has been attributed to motorists seeking out garages
selling cheaper petrol and the efforts of supermarket chains who have
increased their national share from 18% to 20%.
The prospect of continuing downward pressure on demand for petrol as a
result of new taxes and environmental concerns also has been given as a
reason for the price cuts.
Esso has started a Price Watch campaign in Central Scotland and
Tyneside, but has denied that it is trying to start a price war.
Mr Bernie Holloway, general sales manager of Esso, refused to concede
yesterday that the company had been drawn into a price battle.
''What the competition chooses to do about our campaign is up to them.
We are offering the motorist a great deal,'' he said.
A spokesman for Shell claimed that the Esso initiative had been made
in response to price reductions introduced by Shell.
BP also claimed that Esso's initiative merely matched what it had been
doing for the past two years.

ULSTER peace talks at Chequers were called off last night at less than
24 hours notice. The crunch issue of IRA disarmament could not be
agreed.
There was thinly disguised acrimony between London and Dublin in the
breakdown. The summit fiasco now threatens relations between the two
governments and could even fracture the year-long terrorist ceasefire in
Northern Ireland.
Four times the Prime Minister and the Irish Premier John Bruton spoke
on the phone to rescue the summit, but Mr Major refused Irish appeals
over the decommissioning of terrorist weapons.
A Dublin spokesman stressed that the Bruton government was not willing
to say terrorist arms should be got rid of before the inclusive
negotiations got under way. That remark, within minutes of the formal
statement announcing the delay, effectively dismissed the central plank
of Britain's policy on the arms issue.
The Prime Minister last night called Northern Ireland Secretary Sir
Patrick Mayhew and the its political development Minister Michael Ancram
to London from Belfast. The three will meet this morning to decide what
to do next.
Sinn Fein insists all-party talks must start before the IRA agrees
even to the principle of handing over weapons supervised by an
international commission. Mr Major insists Semtex explosives, mortars,
and missiles -- mainly lodged in the Republic -- must be decommissioned
before talks can begin.
It was left to the Dublin Government, at No 10's insistence, to
announce the Chequers summit scheduled for today is to be postponed.
The British Government held back from issuing an official statement
while Mr Major and Sir Patrick took time to find the words to conceal
their irritation. The London belief is that Dublin has changed tack
since the jointly agreed Downing Street Declaration and that party
politics in Dublin, fanned by Sinn Fein, has thwarted progress.
Throughout yesterday, there had been intense political activity in
Dublin with meetings involving Irish Ministers, Sinn Fein leaders and
also a team from the Social Democratic Labour Party led by Mr John Hume,
one of the original brokers of the peace process.
Eventually the Dublin Government issued a brief statement in which Mr
Bruton suggested a postponement of the summit.
Mr Major agreed to this ''to allow some more time to reconcile
outstanding differences''.
The two governments were ready to finalise agreement at Chequers on an
international commission to supervise disarmament. But at the eleventh
hour, after Mr Bruton had talked again to Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams,
he was insisting this agreement should be coupled with a British
Government commitment to all-party talks.
This demand infuriated British Ministers, because Dublin knows the
Ulster Unionists, who elect a new leader on Friday, could not accept
such a commitment.
Late last night there was no sign the governments could put a date to
the postponed summit.
Over the past 10 days, Mr Major and Sir Patrick have been alarmed at
messages emanating from Dublin that the Irish Government was reneging on
an understanding that constitutional talks could not begin without
disarmament.
Sir Patrick responded by indicating that a solid commitment to the
principle of disarmament might be enough. But two days ago Mr Adams
delivered the IRA's reaction. ''Surrender either by the front door or
the back door is out of the question.''
Over the weekend the two Prime Ministers and their officials worked
frantically for a summit that would entail an independent international
supervision of a hand-over of explosives and missiles.
Mr Bruton, however, was unable to deliver Sinn Fein and the IRA to a
statement committing them to disarmament.
The Ulster Unionists last night said they have been proved right:
every British Government concession to the IRA is met with demands for
even more concessions.
The Irish Government announcement on the summit stated: ''There will
be a hopefully short postponement to allow a worthwhile meeting to be
held. The delay has been made at Mr Bruton's request.''
It is clear the crucial difference is on the handing over of IRA
weapons. What is not yet clear is the impact of the Ulster Unionist
leadership election on Friday.
Sinn Fein and the IRA are believed to want to see who succeeds Mr
James Molyneaux and what reaction will follow from the loyalist
paramilitaries.

DEFYING international protests, France set off an underground nuclear
blast last night on a remote atoll in the South Pacific, the first in a
series of tests.
The blast took place in a tunnel beneath Mururoa Atoll, and ended a
three-year French moratorium on nuclear testing, which had been joined
by all of the world's nuclear powers except China.
Public outrage erupted when French President Jacques Chirac announced
the planned tests in June, saying they were necessary so that France
could create computer simulations that would make further tests
unnecessary.
The blast last night was equivalent to about 20,000 tons of TNT, the
French Defense Ministry announced in Paris. The atomic bomb which
destroyed Hiroshima was equal to about 15,000 tons of TNT.
Earlier two anti-nuclear protesters, were found on France's main test
site.
They were believed by French authorities to be former British SAS
soldiers. A senior French officer said the two men used kayaks, towed by
an inflatable dinghy, to reach Mururoa on Monday.
Anti-nuclear activists led by Greenpeace have harassed French military
forces on Mururoa with pre-dawn raids since last Friday in a bid to stop
the first test.
Last night after the test, the protest grew world-wide.
There was almost immediate condemnation from America, New Zealand,
Australia, Japan, Chile, and Peru.
New Zealand and Chile said they were recalling their ambassadors in
France for consultations in protest.
''As a mark of New Zealand's outrage, I have today instructed that the
New Zealand ambassador in Paris, Mr Chris Beeby, is to be recalled to
New Zealand immediately for consultations,'' Prime Minister Jim Bolger
said in a statement.
''It's an obscene outrage. This is completely unacceptable,'' said
Greenpeace's New Zealand spokesman Michael Szabo.
The White House said it was urging Paris to refrain from any further
tests.
US officials said President Bill Clinton had conveyed his concern to
France over the change of policy.
''The Australian government utterly condemns France's nuclear
explosion at Mururoa,'' Prime Minister Paul Keating said. ''By their
actions the French express contempt for the countries and people of the
region and for all those who hope and work for a nuclear free world.''
Australian Foreign minister Gareth Evans said he would call in the
French ambassador.
