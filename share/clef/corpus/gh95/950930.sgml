The Velvet Years:
Warhol's factory, 1965-67
Photographs by Stephen Shore; text by Lynne Tillman
Pavilion, #20
Stephen Shore first walked into Andy Warhol's Factory on a May
afternoon in 1965 and stayed for two years to record in grainy black and
white photographs the cataclysmic cultural explosion whose shock waves
spread from there across America and then the world.
He was an adventurous and curious boy and soon became part of the
furniture in the anarchaic world of Warhol's strolling celebs.
His status as an insider allowed him to achieve candid and informal
prtraits of the major Factory players, including the Velvet Underground,
Billy Name, Edie Sedgwick and Paul Morrissey.
Shore watched and learned as Warhol made aesthetic decisions and says
in his contribution that ''Andy awakened my sense of aesthetic
thought.''
Since these years, Shore had exhibited widely, but the intensity of
those early years and his reflection of a remarkable period may remain
his most valuable contribution.

IF your employer fails to provide the benefits you need, and cannot be
persuaded to do so, it will be up to you to make provision yourself. For
one thing, you can no longer rely on the State.
The rules of State benefits in the event of illness changed five
months ago, reducing the payments made from week 28 of illness and
introducing the condition that you must be unable to do any occupation,
not only your own, to be eligible.
''This means if you want to ensure continuance of income, protection
has to be arranged to provide much-needed peace of mind in what is a
stressful time,'' said Charlie Carpenter, an independent financial
adviser in Glasgow. Protection will usually take the form of permanent
health insurance or critical illness cover.
Even those in what is often regarded as well-provided employment may
be surprised at the lack of benefits they would receive from their
employer.
Public-sector employees, for example, will normally receive full
salary for up to six months if off sick, half-salary for another six
months, and will have to rely on State benefits thereafter. So in the
event of long-term illness they too are thrown back on relying on State
provision unless they have made their own arrangements.
For death in service, the insurance cover for many public sector
employees is only one year's salary. Unless they have their own
insurance on top, their dependants could soon be thrown back to relying
entirely on the State.
Without the protection of death-in-service benefits, you have to look
at how the family would cope with the death of the breadwinner,'' said
Carpenter. ''The State benefit to a widow is currently #58 weekly.
''Unless you have a substantial capital sum from which your dependants
can draw an income, the future is very bleak. With interest rates at
between five per cent and seven per cent, you would need around #200,000
of capital to produce a #1000-per-month income for your family.''
While the family is still financially dependant, a Family Income
Benefit plan can be operated at low cost to produce the required extra
income during those vulnerable years.
For the majority who will survive their working years, it is essential
to ensure that money is available for retirement. ''When surveyed, lack
of money was the single biggest worry among pensioners,'' said
Carpenter.
''It does not have to be so, because with the tax benefits of pension
planning, you really are buying the best savings vehicle around. As an
employee, for every #100 paid into a pension, the Government adds #33
immediately.''
This money is invested in a tax-free environment to build a large
fund. From this you can not only draw an income when you retire, but the
accumulating fund is normally also available to your dependants if you
die before you can draw the benefits.

SCOTS have shown their overwhelming support for the introduction of a
minimum wage in an opinion poll.
With more than three-quarters of Scots in agreement that low pay has
become more of a problem since the Conservatives came to power in 1979,
80% gave their support to the introduction of a minimum wage of #4.15
per hour or higher. Even among Tory voters, more than two-thirds were
found to be in support.
The results of the poll, commissioned by Unison, have been released to
coincide with a joint Unison/Scottish Low Pay Unit seminar on low pay in
Scotland.
Mr Matt Smith, Unison Scottish Secretary, said yesterday: ''It is an
outrage that so many Scottish workers take home a pittance while a
privileged few at the top enjoy huge increases in pay and fringe
benefits.''
The issue of underpaid workers and the minimum wage will be debated
during the Labour Party conference in Brighton.
Mr Smith added: ''I hope Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown gets the clear
message from our poll that the Scottish people back Labour's plan for a
minimum wage but at a level which will seriously begin to tackle the
problem of poverty pay.''

AGRICULTURE Minister Douglas Hogg yesterday bowed to pressure from
Aberdeen's academic community by announcing that half of the scientific
posts at the Food Science Laboratory at Torry are to be moved to other
institutions within the city.
Thirty-five of the internationally renowned lab's 70 scientists will
be transferred to the Marine Science Laboratory, also at Torry, the
Rowett Research Institute, and the University of Aberdeen.
The news was broken to staff yesterday at a meeting with Professor
Peter Stanley, chief executive of the Central Science Laboratory, the
MAFF executive agency responsible for running Torry.
Much of the lab's work involves research into food safety.
Union leaders said they were disappointed that Scottish Secretary
Michael Forsyth, who intervened in the dispute earlier this year, had
not succeeded in persuading his Cabinet colleague to retain all 100 jobs
in Aberdeen.
The fate of the 30 support staff at the lab remained unclear last
night amid rumblings that only a handful of them would be transferred
along with their colleagues.
The closure moves provoked anger among Aberdeen MPs and scientists,
who formed a task force headed by the distinguished microbiologist,
Professor Hugh Pennington, of the University of Aberdeen.
It produced a report agreeing that the lab was no longer viable but it
called on the Government to retain the jobs in the city.
''I have accepted this analysis in part and as a result, now agree
that a significant number of posts may remain in Aberdeen,'' said Mr
Hogg yesterday. ''The scientific posts now at Torry will now be
distributed equally between York and Aberdeen with microbiology posts
predominating at York.''
Labour MP Bob Hughes said: ''We were faced with the Government's
financial dogma. But I am pleased that we have saved so much of the
scientific work and scientific jobs for Aberdeen.''

Leila Aitken offers tips on how to keep your summer blooms right
through the winter months
THIS has been a wonderful summer for dried flowers. There hasn't been
the usual problem of waiting for a dry day to harvest them and most
plants have produced abundant crops.
Autumn is the best time to preserve all foliage -- though beech is
best -- to put with dried flowers in winter arrangements. Beech is
virtually indestructible and can be stored flat when not needed over the
summer. It stays supple and does not lose its colour.
To preserve foliage with glycerine:
* Pour a bottle of glycerine into a Pyrex jug. Fill the bottle twice
with hot water and stir it briskly into the glycerine.
* Divide it into jam jars and stand the sprays of foliage in 5cm (2in)
of the solution.
* Leave them in a cool dark place for about two weeks, when it will be
supple to touch and tiny droplets of glycerine may be visible on the
surface of the leaf. It will also have changed in colour.
There is still time to preserve the last of the garden flowers by
drying them in the microwave. This is quicker than hanging them in
bunches and it also gives better results. The flowers do not shrivel as
air-dried flowers do and keep their colour longer.
You will need silica gel to absorb moisture. Available from chemists
or floral art suppliers.
Spread about 1cm of silica gel in the base of a shallow pie dish. Cut
the heads from aspray of chrysanthemums (these are good flowers to
experiment with), leaving a stalk on each of about 2.5cm. Place the
head, face down and not touching, on top of the crystals and pour over
the rest to completely cover them. Microwave on full power for around
two minutes, 50 seconds. Allow to cool before carefully pouring off the
silica. Keep the flowers in a dry atmosphere or they will re-absorb
moisture and become floppy.
The disadvantage of microwaved flowers is that they are brittle. So
you need to devise ways of arranging them so that they will not get
knocked and their heads will be protected.
Here are two suggestions:
* A flower basket. You will need: one small basket with a fairly flat
rim; oasis foam; florist's green moss; florist's wire; ribbon; a
selection of microwaved flowers -- rosebuds, tiny rock plants, pinks,
cornflowers and daisy types.
Wrap the handle of the basket with ribbon, leaving the ends in a bow.
Cut thin strips about 2.5cm deep from a block of oasis foam to fit
around the rim. Wind them with florist's wire to hold in place and cover
the oasis with moss, securing it with small pins of wire bent into a
U-shape. Insert masses of flowerheads into the oasis so that it is
completely covered, adding tiny microwaved ivy leaves. (You may need to
add extra stems of florist's wire to the larger flowers to hold them
firmly).
* A flower tree (makes a very pretty table decoration, the height of
the stem and the ball both help protect the fragile flowerheads). You
will need: a flower pot; a garden cane 45cm (18in) long; an oasis ball
10cm (4in) diameter; a small block oasis; pebbles; sprigs of microwaved
box 7cm (3in) long; microwaved single chrysanthemums and cornflowers.
Flat-faced flowers work best for a flower ball and in this case were
chosen to complement the colours of the pot.
Wedge a block of oasis in the pot. Insert the cane and press the oasis
ball on top. Insert sprigs of box uniformly around the ball. You will
need to add firmer stems to the daisies. To do this, bend over 1cm at
the end of a fine florist's wire and insert until the other end is
embedded in the flower head. Shorten as necessary. Insert the daisies
until the oasis is completely covered. Tie a ribbon bow around the cane
just under the ball, leaving trailing ends, and conceal the oasis in the
pot with pebbles.

* THIS painting is shown today because I couldn't resist it. Entitled
The Fixer and dedicated on the back ''To Ken the Fixer, a man like
yourself'', it was painted by Jack Vettriano around 1990 and offered by
Phillips in their sale of Scottish Contemporary Art in Glasgow on
September 15. The auction house estimated it at about #800 and were
eager to see what it would make because it was the first Vettriano to be
sold in auction. In fact it made #1500.

HOME IS WHERE THE ART IS
They are the revolutionary wing of the textile brigade. They call
themselves the Timorous Beasties, and their designs are anything but.
Ann Donald meets the lads who are putting a modern spin on tradition
I REMEMBER walking into my granny's tiny Edinburgh living room one day
to discover that she had converted it into a cross between a London
gentleman's private smoking club and a seedy New Orleans bordello. This
disturbing transition from the sedate Laura Ashley look she had favoured
previously came courtesy of the new wallpaper she'd snapped up at a
closing down sale in Easter Road. Sumptuous ruby red velvet deep enough
to lose yourself in, and embossed with ornate gold ferns standing half a
metre tall in a repeat pattern, now formed a loud yet grand backdrop for
the plethora of family photos, ornaments and dried flowers in vases.
Walking into the converted church studio of textile designers Timorous
Beasties, the same opulence and excesses of rich colour last witnessed
in my granny's living room wallpaper came racing back, though here the
line between fin-de-siecle grandeur and finely executed intricate
designs is magnified ten-fold.
Here is where eighteenth century classic French ornamentation meets
fabric excess unseen since the court of Louis XIV, all filtered through
the fermenting imaginations of educated artistic magpies who rail
against all that is mediocre.
From a bar are draped magnificent 6ft by 20ft samples in velvet, one
boasts luminous yellow and red entwined serpentine swirls while another
revels in a pattern that has as its central motif a yellow devil's head
with beady, burning red eyes. While in sharp contrast to this flamboyant
side, lying on top of one of the two 50ft trestle tables that dominate
the studio, are delicate almost copperplate pencil drawings of botanical
objects, acorns and scuttling beetles that appear to have been liberated
from a naturalist's encyclopedia.
Stacked neatly underneath the tables are piles of offcuts in velvet,
suede, cotton, canvas and silk all bearing witness to the Beasties
talent in absorbing, fusing and blending a clutch of these apparently
disparate elements into essentially traditional designs with a definite
modern spin that necessitates a second glance every time.
Established back in January 1990, the two Glasgow School of Art
textile design graduates have embossed their Beasties stamp on the
interiors of numerous Glaswegian establishments including the Theatre
Royal, The Voodoo Room, MaxaLuna, The Living Room, Bar Miro and The
Puppet Theatre. Not to mention the numerous private commissions and sale
of designs to textile companies in Germany, France, Britain and America.
Sitting in the midst of a sheaf of classical Greek designs that will
eventually be fashioned into set designs for Scottish Opera's La Belle
Helene later this year, the 28-year-old duo -- Paul Simmons and Alistair
McAuley -- reveal that it was in fact those at Scottish Opera's home,
the Theatre Royal, who were brave enough to give them their first public
commission. ''For the first three years nothing serious happened and we
racked up a lot of debt,'' explains McAuley. ''People liked our work and
we did private odd jobs but no one had the confidence to use us. Only
after designing fabrics for a suite of rooms in the Theatre Royal did
things begin to snowball.''
As they freely admit, what others view as being unconventional and
noncommercial, has proved to be The Beasties' strong point in that their
unusual designs stand head and shoulders above what they describe with
youthful arrogance as a ''staid and dull market''.
''It's not that we're amazing it's just that everyone else is pretty
damn awful,'' states Simmons with disarming directness. ''The whole
textiles market is very safe and very dull so our strength lies in the
fact that we're not like that.'' Leafing through the meticulously drawn
sunflowers, acorns and laurel leaves about to be ''crackled, twisted,
photocopied and experimented with'' for a future design, he also
attributes success to their invaluable drawing skills. ''It really is
fundamental to our designs and we spend a long time concentrating on the
details -- often one month on each design.''
Alongside this skill and brimming confidence in their own work -- ''if
we like it then there's bound to be two other people out there who will
love it as well'' -- another prestigious asset is their trademark
personal touch which is derived from physically picking up the screen
and pushing the squeegee over the ink. Pointing to the long trestle
table where a length of material lies with a pale green snaking fern
pattern, McAuley explains the advantages of this traditional and basic
process.
''Because this is a small hands-on affair, it's financially viable for
us to produce say seven rolls of fabric for one client that is not only
on velvet but is a complete original.'' He also feels that clients
appreciate the idiosyncracies of hand-printing in comparison to the
perfection of mass-produced fabrics. ''With us you're going to get
little nuances and characteristics where for example the ink has been
slightly uneven, but that makes it look really special opposed to a
clean and identical machine-run fabric.''
As to the future, the young bucks clearly have one eye on The
Encyclopedia Of Ornaments -- ''every textile designer's bible'' -- and
one eye on their burgeoning bank balance. ''At the moment the only way
people can get our work is if they come here to the studio. There's a
whole world out there so what we've got to do is get ourselves a small
piece of a much bigger pie,'' reports an assured McAuley. ''We want to
get worldwide distribution for a commercial range of fabrics but still
keep producing all the one-offs that give us the kudos, from here.''
Summing up this trick balance between compromise, credibility and
control, Simmons adds enthusiastically: ''We definitely want to keep the
contract work different from what we do here. That's the beauty of
having the facilities here to produce the really wild over-the-top
fabrics,'' he says gesticulating towards the luminous velvet design and
exaggerated Georgia O'Keefe flower print adorning the walls.
Having made their mark in the west, there only remains the north,
south and east to conquer before the likes of B &amp; Q will be ringing to
the sound of customers asking for a Beasties design instead of the
ubiquitous woodchip or a floral Laura Ashley.
* Timorous Beasties are at 92 Raeberry Street, Glasgow,0141 945 3964.

A sale of decorative antiques will have specialists and amateurs alike
shivering with excitement but, as Liz Taylor observes, the most unusual
objects belong in the garden
FOR the non-specialist antique collector some of the best sales to
attend are those advertised under the name of Decorative Modern Antiques
because so many of the goods on offer look splendid in modern houses.
The adjective ''modern'' means that the articles being sold date from
the late nineteenth until the middle of the twentieth century. If they
are later than that they are usually called ''contemporary''.
The modern period embraces late Victorians, Art Nouveau and Art Deco
and so there are many lovely things to be found. Phillips are holding
such a Modern Decorative sale in Glasgow on October 6 and the 420 lots
on offer range from glorious pieces of Monart and Lalique glass to
Moorcroft and Scottish pottery, a William de Morgan Charger (which
originally sold for #15), Wylie and Lochead furniture, and two
wrought-iron sweet pea trainers of the 1920s which would greatly adorn a
modern garden.
Prices range from high to very reasonable. In the high range, only
connoisseurs will be bidding for two framed tile panels made by Morris
and Company, with each double set of tiles showing a different month of
the year, two tiles for each month. The designs are the work of William
Morris, Edward Burne Jones, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, and Ford Maddox
Brown and they have all concentrated on a medieval theme, showing people
carrying out traditional seasonal tasks, including slaughtering a pig.
There are also signs of the Zodiac painted in the top right-hand
corners. The titles were copied by William Morris's business partner in
Morris and Co, Lucy Faulkner, and sold in their shop in London's Hanover
Square. The estimated price expected for them is between #8000 and
#12,000.
The William Morris Arts and Crafts movement is also represented by a
set of nine coasters and a dozen table mats embroidered in coloured
wools by Morris's daughter, May. The coasters are expected to sell for
around #500 and the mats for #600.
May might also have been responsible for four crewel-work curtains
embroidered with exotic leaves and fruits, rabbits, and other little
animals (about #1000).
Morris himself is represented in the sale by a watercolour design he
made for a tapestry called Woodpecker which was completed in 1886. This
design is estimated at around #3000.
Morris's associate William de Morgan designed a large charger in the
sale which is expected to sell for a high price of around #1800. It is
decorated in Islamic style with a mythical four-legged animal with a
bird's beak, surrounded by bands of foliage and coloured in bright
blues, turquoises, and maroons. It is the one that Morris and Co sold
for #15.
Another famous artist, Walter Crane, the children's book illustrator
who died in 1915, is represented in the sale by a lovely screen for a
child's bedroom with fairy tale panels painted by Crane. This delightful
piece is expected to sell for around #400.
In the pottery section are German Mettlach vases (around #500);
several pieces of Scottish poetry including Bough and Macmerry, one of
the latter of a plaque by Elizabeth Mary Watt that is expected to fetch
around #700, and some fine pieces of Moorcroft in the Pomegranate,
Florian, Pansy and Moonlight Blue patterns as well as an unusual
salt-glazed vase painted in bands of blue over grey with stylised sprays
of foliage up the side. This vase is expected to go for around #1200
because it is so unlike the usual Moorcroft style.
Scottish glass, Monart and Vasart, are well represented, with average
pieces going for around #200 but an unusual stoneware style mottled gren
Monart vase is estimated at around #600. The most prized piece of glass,
however, is a 10 inch high-green Lalique vase, moulded with parakeets
against foliage, which carries an estimate of between #3000 and #5000.
This lovely vase was discovered by a Phillips valuation team in its
vendor's attic. For years it had done duty as a lamp but fortunately it
had avoided the terrible damage of having a hole bored in it for the
flex.
Perhaps the most unusual items in the sale are two wrought-iron
pyramids which gardeners used to grow sweet peas. They are between eight
feet and nine feet tall and are obviously not intended for any common or
garden because their finals are decorated with wrought-iron lilies,
irises and roses. They were made in the 1920s by an ironsmith called
Thomas Hadden who trained in his craft at Howgate before going to London
where his talents were recognised by the architect Sir Robert Lorimer,
who frequently commissioned him to make wrought iron artefacts for
houses he was designing.
Today Hadden's wonderfully delicate sweet pea trainers are expected to
sell for around #1200 for the pair. It is to be hoped that the buyer
will put them into a lovely garden and grow flowers up them again. Four
pairs of wrought iron candlesticks also by Hadden, which used to adorn a
church in Morningside, are in the sale. The larger pairs should make
around #700 and the two smaller pairs about #400.

GOING WILD
Now is the time to top up that enviromentally friendly heap suggests
Richard Hobbs, but leave some for the beasties
AFTER all the sun and lack of rain, parts of my garden are looking
rather tired. In fact, many plants are dying back for the winter already
but I'm not worried as most things are very good at bouncing back. A
number of plants that have been cut back to remove dead tops have
started to shoot again from the bottom thanks to lower temperatures and
a little rain.
All the cut material has gone to the compost heap. Heaps of compost
are very important to the wildlife garden. The heap itself will be used
by hedgehogs and toads and compost makes an excellent mulch and soil
improver.
A supply of good garden compost helps retain moisture in the garden,
increases the earthworm population and therefore aeriation and drainage.
All non-woody garden waste can be made into compost and, in fact, woody
material can too if it has been through a shredder. Weeds will be killed
by the heat in the heap but if you are not an experienced compost maker
don't put on too much of the really perennial weeds such as nettle roots
(the tops are no problem), ground elder and couch grass. In order to
produce good compost the heap needs to have a good supply of water and
air.
Garden compost has been shown to be much more effective than peat and,
more importantly, does not threaten wildlife in the way that peat
extraction does throughout the world. When environmentalists started
looking at the great threat posed to wildlife by peat extraction it was
regarded as a British problem. People said: ''Oh, there's plenty in
Ireland.'' We now know that is not the case. Then the argument turned to
Russia. Sixty-two per cent of the world's peat is in Russia -- there's
enough there to last us for centuries we were told but this is not true
either. David Bellamy, when visiting Russia last year, found that there
are no large intact peatlands left (that are good for wildlife) in
Russia.
As wildlife gardeners we must stop using peat. It is still very
difficult to buy a range of peat-free container grown plants but there
are some around and if we the customers demand them, more and more will
appear. Meanwhile, get started on that compost heap.
In practice two heaps are needed. One rotting down and undisturbed and
the other taking new material. It is the former that is most important
to wildlife.
In late October or early November, hedgehogs will be starting to find
a place for their winter hibernation. Compost heaps are favourites and
if undisturbed are ideal. They will usually go towards the base so if
you are building a frame for the heap leave some access holes.
Wood material can be a problem to dispose of but rather than burn it
or put it in the dustbin why not make a pile of logs and brush wood in a
cool shady place -- behind the garden shed perhaps or in a hedge bottom.
Just allow them to slowly rot down. This provides a good over wintering
spot for frogs, toads and newts and in a summer like the one we've just
had, a welcome relief from the heat.

WILDLIFE GARDEN
* WHEN you choose plants think about those which are beneficial to
wildife at the same time as being attractive. You can either mix beds of
these with areas of more formal planting, or set aside a specific area
as your wildlife garden.
For shrubs and small trees, pick the ones with flowers attractive to
insects, or which produce berries in the autumn -- these will be a
welcome treat not only for resident birds but also for winter visitors
like fieldfare and redwing.
Some examples of good plant choices are given below -- for more ideas
consult one of the many excellent books now available on the subject.
BERRIES -- hawthorn, rowan, bird cherry, cotoneaster.
SEEDS -- teasels, thistles, sunflowers, cow parsley.
BUTTERFLIES &amp; MOTHS -- buddleia, sedum spactabile, nettles, lady's
smock, bird's foot trefoil.
Birds can of course also be encouraged by setting up a bird table or
other feeding point. You can make an interesting record by keeping a
regular count ofd the different birds that visit your table during the
season.
The birds will also greatly appreciate a constant supply of fresh
water, so you might want to construct some form of pond. This can be as
elaborate or as expensive as you choose, and could range from the
ready-made kits available at garden centres to an upturned dustbin lid!

Michael Fry watches the uneasy calm over the capital as both sides
issue threat and counter threat. The situation for citizens shows no
sign of improving
EDINBURGH, September 30 -- Fears are growing of an outbreak of
fighting on the streets of the capital, as tension rises between the
Government's garrison still holding out in the castle and the Jacobite
army of occupation.
The flashpoint is the weighhouse at the head of the Lawnmarket, only a
few yards from the castle's main gate, normally used by the officials
who enforce the burgh's trading regulations. There, since the Jacobites
returned from their victory at Prestonpans eight days ago, they have
posted sentries. These have not interfered with the passage of supplies
for the garrison, but may now start to in an attempt to force surrender
of the castle.
So far there has only been a war of words, with messages flying back
and forth all yesterday and today among the town councillors, Prince
Charles Edward Stuart in residence at Holyrood, and the commanders of
the garrison, the 85-year-old English governor of the castle, General
Joshua Guest, and his 86-year-old deputy, General George Preston of
Valleyfield, Fife.
Yesterday the prince demanded that they should guarantee safe conduct
for any Jacobites who want to use the ferries across the Firth of Forth,
from Leith to Kinghorn and between North and South Queensferry, now
guarded by two frigates of the Royal Navy. Preston replied that he would
rather grant a pass to Hell to any Jacobite who applied for one.
He and Guest obviously assumed that this was just the prelude to a
blockade, because they then sent a letter to the Lord Provost of
Edinburgh, Alexander Stewart. It threatened to fire on the Jacobite
sentries unless communication was kept open between the castle and the
town, and to fire on the city itself unless provisions continued to
arrive.
A group of councillors immediately held a meeting in the kirk of St
Giles. This morning, six of them took the generals' letter to show to
the prince at Holyrood. He gave them a written message to return to the
castle saying he was ''equally surprised and concerned'' at the
barbarity of the intention of ''bringing distress on the town''. If the
threat was carried out he would see to the destruction of General
Preston's home.
Preston in turn retorted that he would get the frigates to bombard
Wemyss Castle, the house of Lord Elcho, one of the Jacobite commanders.
The escalation of threats ended with an agreement on a six-day truce
instead, while the two generals seek instructions from London on what
retaliation they should take if their supplies are cut off.
That means the occupation of the capital may soon cease to be a
peaceful one. No damage has been done up to now, and life has gone on
normally, with some exceptions. The officers of the Government have fled
to Berwick. All the ministers of the established Church have left, and
no services were held on Sunday. The banks are closed, after sending
their reserves up to the castle just before the Jacobites arrived.
A desperate shortage of cash is another reason why Prince Charles
needs to force the surrender of the garrison. There are plans to issue a
Jacobite coinage, bearing the head of his father, James VIII. Meanwhile
he has to raise money directly from the people. An armed party under
John Hay of Restalrig returned today from Glasgow after exacting a
contribution of #5500. Taxes have been raised in Perth, Dundee, and
other burghs under Jacobite control. A levy of 2s 6d on every pound of
rental is planned for Edinburgh. The prince has also asked the city to
provide 6000 pairs of shoes and 1000 tents.
Otherwise he has been careful to court the citizens. Some Highlanders
are billeted on ''public houses and people of low rank'', but the rest
are still encamped at Duddingston. The prince has issued a proclamation
that any soldier or person connected with his army found plundering from
''the good people of Edinburgh'' will be executed. His secretary, James
Murray of Broughton, states that ''there is no instance in the history
of any times in whatever country where the soldiery either regular or
irregular behaved themselves with so much discretion, never any riots,
nor so much as a drunk man to be seen''.
But, with little immediate prospect of further fighting, there will be
a problem of morale if the Jacobites cannot somehow keep up their
impetus. After Prestonpans, Charles wanted to march straight to the
Border and seize Berwick, so as to give himself a symbolic foothold in
England too. His council was divided on the question. His Irish advisers
agreed with him, but the Highland chiefs cautioned against a rapid
advance, claiming it would be better to consolidate in Scotland first.
They are also more aware of the difficulty of keeping together an army
of Highlanders over any length of time. Since the capture of Sir John
Cope's baggage and war-chest at Prestonpans, left behind in the haste of
his flight, more than 600 clansmen have gone home to the glens with
their booty. That leaves their strength at about 1400, and it is likely
to take some weeks to recoup it.
The prince has written to chieftains with whom he has had no contact
so far, the Earls of Sutherland and Cromarty, Lords Reay and Fortrose
and Grant of Grant. He has appealed again to others, Norman Macleod of
Macleod and Sir Alexander Macdonald of Sleat, who have refused support.
He assured them that he understood their earlier reluctance to commit
themselves but suggested that, now he has beaten Cope, they might join
him.
But to all intents and purposes, Charles is in control of Scotland.
Apart from Edinburgh Castle, the Government now only holds Stirling
Castle and a few forts in the North. On September 26 the prince sent an
envoy, George Kelly, to Versailles to tell Louis XV of the victory at
Prestonpans and to ask for help.

Decorating with Dried Flowers, Jill Thomas, Cassell, #10.99.
* YOU either like dried flowers or you don't, and there seems to be no
room for any middle ground on this particular subject. This book is for
those not only with a genuine liking for them, but a desire to create
their own decorations. There are 14 projects, ranging from simple
through to incredibly complicated, and all necessary materials and tools
are listed.
This is not for the faint-hearted once you get beyond straight-forward
bunches stuck into vases, but the instructions are detailed and easy to
understand. It must be an advantage if you are naturally patient and
neat-fingered, with a good eye for colour, but although this is a skill
which can be learned, it needs hard work to produce the best effects.
This is a very persuasive book even for someone like myself who refuses
to be swayed from fresh flowers. There were a couple of projects for
special occasions such as Christmas, which were so beautiful you wanted
to keep them forever. And that, I suppose, is the point of it all.
The Green Home, Karen Christensen, Piatkus, #9.99.
* THIS is the practical and political aspects of being green in one
easy read. It covers local and worldwide issues, from the future of the
planet to environmentally friendly pets and manages to deliver the
message without patronising.
Going green can inspire guilt and irritation, because while we know we
should, economics and practicalities sometimes dictate a far different
lifestyle. Pick a subject, check Christensen's extensive index and be
prepared for simple, commonsense information which leaves you free to
make your own choices. Excellent.

Clare Trodden considers the ways in which objects around us affect our
lives
OCTAVIA Hill had it just about right when she said: ''You cannot deal
with people and their houses separately''. She was speaking of the
futility of tackling wider social problems in nineteenth-century Britain
while ignoring the desperate living spaces which spawned a great deal of
the difficulties.
What she said holds true today, though perhaps it should be modified:
''You cannot deal with people and their lack of houses separately''. In
the same way as what you wear says something about you, where you live
speaks volumes -- and not only about you but also reveals a few home
truths about society.
What you are and your chances of what you will be are greatly affected
by your place in life, according to extensive research in A View from
the Interior: Women and Design, edited by Judy Attfield and Pat Kirkham.
For a book about design this seems to be getting into rather deep
sociological waters. But that is the whole point of this work -- to draw
attention to the importance and far-reaching implications of design.
Those who claim to be unaffected by the vagaries of fashion and
changing trends are at best misguided. They may not like current trends
but these affect everything we wear, use, and live in -- if they didn't
many of those now sporting grey flannels and tweeds would still be in
doublet and hose, or off-the-shoulder bearskin. There are those who
would say that this is progress, not fashion.
Yet, as this interesting book shows, fashion, even at its most
ridiculous, can be made to look like progress and vice versa. Clever
marketing may make us think that wearing stiletto heels shows that we
are liberated women who make our own choices about our footwear --
common sense tells us that they are simply some designer's fantasy which
cramp our style in the bus-running stakes.
The politics of fashion, for men and men, is fascinating -- but much
of it has been said before. This book's strength is in making us more
aware of design on a larger scale and in seeing that women have had a
place in it -- even although their efforts have been overshadowed and
often overruled by men. A woman's place may have been in the home but we
need look no further than the atrocities of the fitted kitchen to see
that it was designed by someone without much working knowledge of it.
This is not an anti-male rant, however; it is simply attempting to
redress the balance which has been tipped in favour of male-dominated
design and the assumptions which have been made about women's design
preferences.
These assumptions had far-reaching effects on the health of the nation
long before the discovery of sick-building syndrome. Destroying old
communities for brave new ones which looked good on the drawing board
led to ''New Town blues'', in which ''we women were the ones left to
cope and to adjust'' and to rebuild communities from the constraints of
their little boxes. Feelings of isolation and depression aren't
inherently female problems. The volume of women seeking tonics, Valium,
or Prozac isn't because of their more sensitive natures, it's to do with
their frustration at being unable to effect change in areas which affect
their everyday lives.
It may not be one big conspiracy, although it sounds like it when
nineteenth-century control freaks worried about the ''danger of the
improper use of rooms'' by the lower classes. In a debate about
enlarging the size of the scullery it was deemed that this might ''tempt
families to eat their meals there''. Was this an attempt at social
control or a premonition of the horrendous possibilities of the
breakfast bar?
Such innovations are often hailed as making life easier or as being
crucial to good living. Tosh. The advent of all those labour-saving
devices to lighten the drudgery meant that more was expected of
housewives. With these great expectations came the guilt which sees many
women (present company excepted) running around with a Hoover at ungodly
hours of the morning, doing laundry well into the night, cooking and
freezing in their leisure hours -- and then being surprised that they're
tired when they've had so much help from all these hi-tech gadgets.
Even in those dark days of the servants' hall, each one had certain
tasks and was not expected to do everything to keep the home fires
burning.
Women and Design can be a shade academic at times and is a little
short on good illustration (could this be a statement about the
importance of content over style?) but there are many human touches
which make the theories come alive. Ray Hille and Doris Young who
managed to survive and thrive in the male-dominated furniture trade;
Elizabeth Deane who completed the work on Cork's Naval Dockyards and
successfully carried on the family architecture firm after the death of
her husband; Milli Taplin who made her mark on Wedgwood in the 1920s;
and Susie Cooper who founded her own pottery around the same time and is
still working.
The problems of the past can seem bleak but the potential for the
future is as vast, once the power and effect of design is realised. This
book will make you see your clothes, furniture, and the building you
live in in a different light.

Bounty hunters, honeymooners, lotus eaters, call them what you will
the lure of the Seychelles attracts them all and Rob Robertson
understands why
DEEP in the Indian Ocean nestles a small coral island with empty sandy
beaches, a few huts, a colony of one million birds, and a 150-year-old
giant tortoise called Esmeralda.
Untouched and unbearably beautiful Bird Island in the Seychelles is
one of the last places on earth that can legitimately call itself a
tropical island paradise.
The only intrusion of the twentieth century is the landing strip that
splits the 1.5 mile long Bird Island in two. Otherwise this Seychelles
island is a tropical paradise.
The real ''inhabitants'' of Bird Island are the one million nesting
sooty terns and good old Esmeralda. She doesn't move much, but then
again neither would you if you were reputed to be 150 years old. The old
girl just sits under a palm tree passing the time putting up with
tourists getting their pictures taken leaning on her back.
The only thing that breaks the silence of the island is the birds.
Walking beside their colony is a bit like being an extra in Alfred
Hitchcock's The Birds. Quite conveniently they stick to the far side of
the island. You can go and bother them but they won't bother you.
Scenes from Castaway were filmed in the Seychelles on idyllic beaches
like the one on Bird Island. You can see why. The crystal clear waters
give a picture postcard background. To one side of Bird Island is a reef
teeming with corals and tropical fish. On the other side the Seychelles
shelf falls away into the deep blue sea where they say whales come in to
mate.
During two days walking round the island all I saw was a Japanese man
sun-bathing and a couple of people snorkelling.
Bird Island was bought by Frenchman Guy Savy in 1967 for about
#15,000. The price was arranged not by the value of land but by the
number of coconuts that fell during the year.
They put up a few beach huts for people to stay, started making meals
in one from fresh produce grown there like pumpkin, paw paw, okra,
peppers and home reared chicken and opened it up to a few tourists at a
time.
Not surprisingly Bird Island attracts ornithologists from around the
world. When I was there the former head of the Excon oil company was out
twitching morning, noon, and night.
The beauty of Bird Island is just one of the hidden attractions of the
Seychelles which are south of the equator, off the east coast of Africa.
The islands are fast becoming the place to go for Scots looking for a
romantic wedding location or honeymoon.
There were 10 couples in love on my flight there. They were the ones
kissing and cuddling while the rest of us tried to sleep during the
11-hour flight.
I know that at least one of the couples got married. I was there.
Watched the ceremony, took a few wedding snaps and even turned up at the
reception. Not because I was bosom buddies with the couple, Clive and
Joanne Gallagher from Manchester, but because the wedding is held a
stone's throw away from the beach. Anyone can go. The reception is held
in the hotel dining room.
The in-place for marriages is the plush Plantation Club Hotel on the
main Seychelles island of Mahe, where wedding arrangements are put
together by a Scot.
Neil Dalgliesh, 34, left Royal High School in Edinburgh to work with
the Sheraton Hotel group. His time with them took him to China and
America. He left to balance the books of the Plantation Club as its
financial controller.
''The place is just incredible to work in,'' said Neil who is on a
two-year contract. ''Couples come here for all sorts of reasons. Some
want romantic quiet weddings. Others price things up and realise its
cheaper coming here for a wedding and a holiday of a lifetime rather
than get married back in Scotland.''
Former Scotland and Rangers footballer Robert Fleck got married here.
So have lots of other Scots.
Looking around the islands you can see the attraction. Quiet beaches,
good quality hotels, and good food. And of course the weather.
Before I went I assumed the sun always shines in the Seychelles. Well
not quite. It poured for one day and was over-cast on two others during
my visit.
For honeymooners the sight of a cloudy sky causes problems. Some have
complained about travelling all this way just to have it rain. Others
have been angry because a choppy sea ruined their wedding photographs.
Despite that, the idyll of the place takes some beating. There is only
one set of traffic lights on any of the 115 islands that make up the
Seychelles and that's in the capital city, Victoria on Mahe. They sit
there for the few cars that go up and down the quiet main street.
Equally bizarre is the town's clock tower, a replica of one in
London's Vauxhall Bridge Road. It was built by public subscription in
1903 to celebrate Seychelles' new status as an independent colony.
In the villages south of Mahe there still remain people who have ''not
seen the Clock Tower'' -- the local expression for country bumpkins.
Mahe, with its lush coconut palms, cinnamon and tea plantations and
towering peaks, doesn't take itself too seriously. It is the start and
end for any adventures you take by plane or boat to any out of the way
islands.
The best ones to see are those where the way of life hasn't changed
much, places like La Digue. This island is a three-hour boat journey or
a short plane trip from Mahe and has ox-carts or bicyles as their mode
of transport. The Bacardi cinema adverts were filmed here during a
six-month shoot. So were scenes for the soft-porn Emmanuelle II which
locals somewhat innocently boast about.
The island is also famous for its coconut industry and locals will
oblige with a quick demonstration of how coconut is processed into copra
and oil and how vanilla is cured for export.
A 15-minute flight from Mahe is the island of Praslin, the second
largest island in the Seychelles. Seven miles long and five miles wide,
it is the home of the rare black parrot and the oddly-shaped Coco de Mer
palms which grow in the lush vegetation of the Vallee de Mai. The
Coco-de-Mer fruit is a double-cheeked shape and believed to be an
aphrodisiac and a cure for aches and pains.
Other islands worth a visit are Fregate Island, 15 minutes from Mahe
by air, and Cousin Island, two and a half hours by air, which is owned
by the International Council for Bird Protection. The island is
uninhabited except for the warden, his staff and thousands of birds.
The government minister responsible for the Seychelles is Maurice
Lousteau-Lalanne a former pilot who trained at Prestwick, lived in Ayr,
is keen to find out how Celtic and Rangers are doing and who recalls
with bemusement the Scottish weather.
Maurice Lousteau-Lalanne, as principal secretary of tourism, is
responsible for the 115,000 tourists who come to the islands each year.
Seventy-five per cent of the islands income is from tourism, 80% of the
population are employed in the industry.
So did he learn anything in rain-soaked Scotland that comes in useful
in sun-kissed Seychelles?
''Well maybe we could have more golf courses here,'' he said. ''I
remember the great courses in Ayrshire. Golf is a universal game and
would attract people here.
''I also remember the high number of boats on the west coast of
Scotland and I would like to target sailors to come here.''
As well as sun-bathing there is great scope for activity holidays for
snorkellers and divers. The waters round the Seychelles are among the
best in the world for both sports, and are also popular for deep-sea
fishing.
Locals describe the islands as jewel-like scattered remnants of a
forgotten continent that once bridged Africa and Asia. As you sun-bathe
on Bird Island with the sun beating down and no-one near you it's easy
to believe that their description is true.

Precious coal reserves close to the earth's surface have fuelled
smouldering resentments and sparked bitter debate between residents and
contractors. But, as Peter Evans finds, great efforts are being made in
the fields of conflict
BIG holes in the ground are a speciality for Alan Little. As a project
planner for Scottish Coal he is well aware of their environmental impact
and the strength of feeling they can generate.
After all, open-cast mining is hardly the most scenic of industrial
operations, and proposals for new workings frequently meet vehement
opposition from conservationists and local residents. Witness the furore
created by plans to develop two large mines on the boundaries of
picturesque Ormiston village in East Lothian, reported in this
newspaper.
It's a scenario the coal industry is well used to dealing with.
Following privatisation at the end of last year, British Coal's assets
in Scotland are now managed by Scottish Coal. At a purchase price of
#45m, the new company bought the Longannet deep mine complex in Fife, as
well as nine existing open-cast coal sites and other interests
throughout the Scottish coalfields. The company has an annual turnover
of #150m and employs around 2000 people.
With the decimation of the deep mining industry in recent decades,
winning coal reserves by open-casting has gained prominence. Of all the
open-cast coal produced in Britain, around 23% comes from Scotland, and
the low sulphur and chlorine content make it more environmentally
acceptable when it's burned in power stations.
Open-casting is a process that has a number of advantages over deep
mining -- not least in terms of cost. Instead of boring a shaft and
extracting coal underground, with all the associated engineering and
safety problems that creates, it exposes the coal by ''lifting the lid''
off it. Huge excavating machines can do the rest, and the procedure is
less labour-intensive.
The problem, of course, is the massive scar on the landscape the
method creates, apart from noise, dust, and the potential destruction of
wildlife habitats. With an average site life of 10 years, the workings
are also visible for long periods.
Unlike quarrying, however, which leaves a permanent scar and leads to
the kind of controversy generated by the Harris superquarry proposals
for Lingerbay in the Western Isles, open-cast sites can be restored.
The notion of restoration is not a new one, and in fact goes back a
long way, but with an ever more environmentally aware public ready to
pounce on any transgressions, Scottish Coal's policy is tightly
controlled.
''We see it as a balancing act. We are taking something out, so we try
to put something back,'' says Little. ''We try to restore the area even
though it may not be the best course operationally, and sometimes we can
actually improve the land that was already there.''
Gazing down on the gigantic crater that is Blindwells Extension
open-cast mine near Tranent in East Lothian, it's hard to imagine how
such devastation can be restored -- but it can.
Not far away, on the other side of the busy A1 arterial road, are 900
acres of productive farmland. ''That was the original Blindwells site
started back in 1978,'' says site officer Don MacIver. ''After the coal
was removed the land was restored to its present form. Fences were
replaced, trees were planted and the whole area was subject to a
five-year aftercare programme which ensured it was as fit for farming as
it was before the site was started.''
Restoration is progressive throughout the life of a site, and in the
case of Blindwells Extension, 65 acres presently being restored have a
special significance historically.
Now owned by Scottish Coal, the area was originally landscaped in the
style made famous by the Northumberland-born master of garden design
Capability Brown. Brown, whose Christian name was Lancelot, acquired the
nickname from his habit of saying that a place had ''capabilities''.
Simple, harmonious patterns were his hallmark, without the use of
symmetry.
The landform at Blindwells is shown on the Ordnance Survey map dating
back to 1854, and was created to provide a vista for Seton House
mansion, which looks out on to it. The mansion, on the Wemyss Estate,
was designed by Scottish architect Robert Adam -- also responsible for
Culzean Castle.
Seton's present tenant, Charles Stevenson, explained that the land had
not been owned by the estate but had been ''borrowed'' to create a
pleasant view from the house -- a common practice of the time. ''It's a
classic piece of what is known as 'borrowed landscape','' he said.
A condition of the planning application for the open-cast extension at
Blindwells was that the land, which had deteriorated in condition and
was being used as a market garden, was restored to its original
contours, as shown on the nineteenth-century Ordnance Survey map. It's
early days yet, and the area looks little more exciting than a large,
rough field, but planting to achieve the finished effect will begin in
November.
A key to successful restoration is the careful handling of top and
sub-soil materials which are removed and stored separately before coal
excavation. Once extraction is completed, rock that overlay the reserves
is replaced to about 1.5 metres below the final contour levels agreed
with the local authorities and other interested parties.
The ground is then made up to finished levels using separate layers of
clay-type and finer soils, each of which undergoes de-stoning. With the
land restored to approved levels, the process of aftercare begins -- a
task now undertaken in collaboration with the Scottish Agricultural
College.
Management of the land is undertaken to achieve its intended
agricultural after-use. Soil quality is restored through fertilisation
and ''sacrificial cropping'', and trees and hedges planted. As well as
agricultural use, sites can be restored as nature reserves or for
recreational pursuits.
Site activities during operation are often a focus of criticism for
residents living on the fringes of open-cast developments. Day-to-day
controls at Blindwells help keep the impact to a minimum. They include
measures such as dust suppression, noise and blast monitoring, and the
maintenance of water quality for any water leaving the site.
Scottish Coal also provides the opportunity for local liaison
committees to be set up, allowing community and interested-party
representatives to air their views and raise matters of concern. Charles
Stevenson is a member of the Blindwells liaison committee and initially
raised the prospect of restoring the Capability Brown-style landscape.
Alan Little recognises that there are people who will never accept the
development of open-cast sites, however stringent the controls and
however convincing the case for restoration. Compromise has so far won
the day for Scottish Coal, as it did for its nationalised predecessor
British Coal.
But it is not the only developer in the market. At Ormiston, two
private companies are involved in the proposals -- William Grant Ltd and
James Fenton and Sons. With increasing interest in open-casting, battles
will continue to be fought -- the ultimate arbitrators the local
authorities or the Scottish Office, if opposition forces a public
inquiry.
Weighed in the balance are factors like employment -- always a
powerful lever in communities where it is scarce -- habitat destruction,
visual impact, health and general disturbance to quality of life, as
well as the energy needs of the nation and the relative merits of using
coal as against nuclear power and other forms of energy generation.
Restoration techniques have improved greatly since the early days of
open-cast mining, and people like Alan Little know that the days of
mineral exploitation without responsibility are gone forever.
''In our business we cannot operate without making an impact on the
community,'' he says. ''We are judged solely on the merits of our last
job, and I'm proud to say that we have a good track record as far as the
environment is concerned.''

Hilda McLean examines the growing interest in lace-making
MOST of the Scottish lace mills have been silent for years, but
lace-making is on the increase in pockets of homes across the country.
For many it is just a hobby and they do not sell their wares, but guild
shows and country fairs are testament to the growing, intricate, and
innovative work which is being created.
Scotland's first certificated lace-maker and leading lace designer
Elizabeth Griggs first took up lace-making 12 years ago after receiving
a kit as a Christmas present from her then pre-teen children. A simple
band, which she still has, was her first lace creation. But it was not
long before her children realised they had given mum not just the
threads of a hobby but had pointed her in the direction of a full-scale
passion with bobbins and cotton.
Nowadays she thinks little of creating enormously intricate little
dragon flies, cats, and colourful badges representing Egyptian lore, as
well as new designs for table cloths, bonnets and collars, bridal
garters and even Christmas cards. She has even been called in to advise
the Duchess of Buccleuch on the restoration of her collection of antique
lace at Drumlanrig Castle.
Her skills were nurtured by expert Valerie Paton in Menstrie, where
Griggs then lived, but she did not forget her passion for lace-making
when her husband's career development necessitated an upsticks decant to
Burnley in Lancashire.
For her hobby at least it proved to be a fortuitous move with a
college in easy travelling distance which offered a City and Guilds
course. And when the family headed home for Scotland four years later
she continued studying, making a 300-mile round trip every week to
complete the course -- becoming the first Scot to achieve the City and
Guild lace-making certificate.
Griggs, who now lives in Sanquhar, said: ''The teacher there, Dorothy
Swinson, was a real inspiration who took us through more than 10
different lace-making disciplines. I believe the course has since been
simplified.''
Griggs' lace-making was an integral part of a presentation of items
from Mennock Rural WI, of which she is President, which won the Team Cup
at the last two Dumfriesshire Federation shows. Last year she picked up
Honours in hand craft with certificates for bobbin lace and lace-making.
Her skills are now being passed on through a local group which she
teaches with classes due to resume in the autumn.
Lace creations are dotted around the family home and Griggs admits
that whole days can be taken up with her hobby.

Stephen McGinty calls in the interior designers to brief them on
mission impossible
INTERIOR designers have been wrestled from the cosseted clutches of
the rich. No longer are they the pampered poodles of those whose taste
was transplanted, replaced by cash. No, no, no. Today's interior
designers are as likely to be working in Bearsden as Balmoral. How do I
know this? Well I happened to have five people around last Friday who
told me so.
I, of course, do not live in Bearsden. It is not possible to retain
the title of trendy-West-End-media-type while living north of Queen
Margaret Drive. They would revoke my licence, allowing me to
mispronounce ''didactic'' and gain 20% off coffee and croissants at the
little deli that us West-End-media-types have told no-one about.
If I sound smug, that's property-owning! Well, property borrowed from
the bank. It has been five months since I moved into my new flat. Never
having done anything by half-measures, I moved from a one-bedroom flat
the size of a shoe-box to the original shoe-box warehouse, a cavern with
three bedrooms, huge hall, dining kitchen with Aga -- I thought to rip
it out until its cost and hip-value were fully explained.
The current use of the living-room is as a five-a-side football pitch.
On the great list of things to do to my flat, decoration was always
tucked on page five, after re-wiring, central heating, and a sofa. After
a summer of eating dust and stumbling by torch-light to the loo,
decoration now looms. Decoration is in fact the wrong word.
Brightening-the-place-up-a-bit sounds better. Decoration indicates
thought, planning, and skill, not attacking the walls with paint-brushes
and an enthusiasm toddlers would brand as childish.
It was time to call in the experts. And that is what they are. As
Linda Reid, of Linda Reid Plus, and Anne McKinnon, of Interior Ideas,
said in almost identical quotes: ''People have this idea that an
interior designer is expensive. It is not true. An interior designer
will save you money and time and will save you from making mistakes.''
* My first mistake was made before Laura Ashley arrived without a hint
of a wild summer dress or big floppy bonnet. Fiona McPhie, the firm's
west-coast designer, is cool, trendy, and at pains to stress the firm's
new image: ''Laura Ashley is not flowers and frills. With the home
styling we are more original. We are going for plain stripes and checks
and a high percentage of our clients are now male.''
My mistake had been to plan and paint the hall walls crimson which
had, of course, clashed violently with the Dulux ocean-cruise-blue
ceiling. Only one wall was done. One was enough. Fiona suggested a
royal-blue ceiling and the walls painted with a more orange-tinted red,
if red it was to be. Green or cream would be more welcoming, matched by
a barley-coloured carpet. To give the impression of more depth, she
suggested a mirror at the end of the hall where light from the master
bedroom floods in.
In the kitchen she spent time conjuring the past into the present.
This is my favourite room. The units are all hand-made from reclaimed
pine, the window looks out on to trees, and the Aga is fire-engine red.
Besides, the rest of the flat looks like it has been blitzed.
To enhance the dated look, Fiona suggested the walls be painted an
ochre-distressed look with an old Scottish saying stenciled round, as a
border. The Aga should be surrounded by tiles and the doors and window
frames waxed. Roman blinds would hang over the window in a plain,
striped fabric.
The cost of a Laura Ashley visit is #50 for three rooms or #100 for
the whole house. This is refundable on purchases of more than #500 and
#1000 respectively.
* Anne McKinnon and Lorraine Tevendale of Interior Ideas found the
hall too intimidating. Lighter colours were suggested: warm yellows or
rusts with a dark carpet or rug flecked with gold or rust or navy to
match the walls. Their kitchen ideas closely resembled Fiona's while
suggesting quarry or terracotta tiles for the floor as prevention
against heat warping the wooden boards.
However, it was their fresh ideas for the bathroom that appealed to
both the wallet and the eye. Currently it stands as a tribute to the
sixties with fine wooden panelling but a dodgy flower-print carpet.
''Lose the carpet,'' said Tevendale before the pair transformed it into
an aquatic refuge.
The wooden walls would be whitewashed with silk emulsion and dotted
with starfish stencils in maroon or blue matched by a blue-shell mirror
and stencilled shower curtains. The carpet-free floor would be tiled.
The window would then be covered by Roman blinds.
In the living-room, the cardinal rule of curtains was explained. ''A
lot of cheap material is better than too little of the more expensive,''
said McKinnon, who felt the curtains would look great falling down in
puddles of material on a sanded, rather than varnished, wooden floor.
The room would be completed by reds, greens, or golds on the walls, a
few modern prints and a mirror above the fireplace.
Interior Ideas charge a call-out fee of #25 whether their expert eyes
have to be cast over one room or six. They then provide three schemes
based on a price structure of cheap, medium, or expensive.
* Between them, Linda Reid and her designer Eileen Lynn managed to use
the term objet d'art eight times in just under one hour. Accoutrements
are close to the hearts of these fine ladies. ''People forget that it is
important to save some money for accessories,'' said Reid. ''They are
just so important at bringing a room together.''
When tackling a home it is common practice for the pair to bring a
video or Polaroid camera when viewing. They are studied back at the
studio, and ideas can be sparked at the oddest moments. After an initial
visit, they return with story-boards for each room, which illustrate how
the room will look after the work is completed.
As the central heating had not yet been installed, they suggested
putting one radiator under the big window in the living-room and boxing
it in, turning it, in effect, into a piece of furniture. ''The choice is
so vast, people don't seem to see that. You can have whatever you
want,'' Lynn said. They wanted my ideas to work with -- yet as a young
male, I insisted I had no ideas. They didn't seem surprised.
To complete a country kitchen look, they suggested hanging grasses and
flowers from the clothes pulley and adding a wooden canopy above the
Aga, with the walls decorated in older colours, French blues and greens.
A visit by Linda Reid costs #40 per room; the consultancy fee is
refundable on orders more than #1000.
So a day with the designers is to see empty rooms decorated and
curtains neatly hung. You close your eyes and imagine the rooms as they
have been described.
It only lasts a few seconds, but the memory remains and then real work
begins. And that is what fathers are for.

Sauteed and with a few slices of toast, freshly picked mushrooms make
a perfect fast feast for Lady Claire Macdonald
JUDGING by the weather as I write we could well be in for an Indian
Summer, having had a positively Mediterranean Summer. A weather sage
here in Skye says that the glorious summer just past is the start of
several years of such summers. This means we could well be picking our
field mushrooms until later into the year. And the same goes for the
wild mushrooms -- or fungi -- which grow in our woods here in such
abundance.
There is no greater snobbery than that to be found in the food and
wine world. We have been picking the wild mushrooms in our woods for
decades now, and yet it has, during the past few years, become a cult
thing among the foodies.
A great deal of rubbish is talked about the different species. The
most important thing is to find an expert to accompany you on your first
expedition. It's best if there are two or three of you at the most. I
love woods, but they are, to me, places for peace and quiet.
If you don't have an expert on hand, a good book is the next best
thing. Antonio Carluccio's A Passion for Mushrooms combines
illustrations of the species with very good recipes.
But let me tell you which I like -- Chanterelles, with which our woods
abound, with their apricot tinge and their upturned trumpet shape, and
Horns of Plenty, with their deceptively dark brownish/purple colour,
also trumpet shaped right down their stalks. I am not much drawn to eat
something going by the name of Trumpets of Death, which is what the
French call them, whereas Horns of Plenty have a far more appealing ring
to them.
I love what we call Hedgehog Mushrooms but they are rarer. What I
don't much care for are ceps. You will see them praised in print, and
taste is a very individual thing, but for me, once I've pulled away
their old spongy underside (often riddled with maggots), sliced and
sauteed them, they remind me only of what I imagine sliced slug must
taste like. For me, they are not worth bothering about. There is one
type, though, called Penny Buns, which are a definite cut above the rest
of the ceps.
I use these wild mushrooms in many recipes. If Godfrey and I want a
quick supper I just saute them in olive oil with garlic. An exotic
risotto can be made using a variety of them, and if you have a couple of
pinches of saffron and extremely good stock (chicken or vegetable) you
can produce a risotto which is food for the gods.
Field mushrooms have a better flavour than any cultivated mushroom.
Their abundance varies from year to year -- one memorable year Godfrey
picked 28lbs in one day! Unlike wild mushrooms, you can pick field
mushrooms in the morning and in many cases, if the weather is right,
there will be a second crop to pick late that afternoon. Wild mushrooms,
on the other hand, take three to four days to grow again. But I'm not
knocking cultivated mushrooms, they are a wonderful food.
There are a couple of points to bear in mind when cooking them,
though. I prefer to buy larger ones rather than the tiny button
mushrooms, which don't have much taste. If you cut their stalks level
with the caps you will find they don't seep water to the same extent
that they do if you pull the stalks out altogether. And if you saute
them over a high heat -- you need oil and butter to do this, as butter
alone would burn -- until they are almost crisp their flavour is much,
much better than if they have a brief saute.
Mushrooms enhance so many things -- they are delicious just sauteed
and piled on thickly buttered toast for a quick dish. They go well with
meat, game and fish, and with eggs, cheese and other vegetables such as
leeks, tomatoes and garlic in particular. They have pretty well no
calories -- until you cook them in oil and butter, that is! And they are
very good for you.
* Lady Claire Macdonald will be giving a cookery demonstration in aid
of St Catherine's Convent, Lauriston Gardens, Edinburgh, at the theatre,
Loretto School, Musselburgh, at 10.30 am (coffee at 9.45) on Monday,
November 20. Tickets are #17.50 or #30 for two. Telephone Gillie
McCowan-Hill on (0131-554 9007). At St Catherine's, the nuns run a
much-needed project to feed around 100 homeless people.
MUSHROOM SOUFFLE
Serves 4
1lb mushrooms, wiped, stalks trimmed, and mushrooms chopped small
1 onion, skinned and finely chopped
1 clove of garlic, skinned and chopped finely -- optional
2 oz butter
2 fairly level tablespoons flour
1 pint milk
salt, pepper and a grating of nutmeg
5 large eggs
butter and freshly grated parmesan cheese.
Butter a souffle or ovenproof dish and dust out with the parmesan.
Melt the butter in a wide-based pan and cook the onion for 2-3 minutes
until it is soft and transparent-looking. Add the garlic and cook for a
minute. Scoop this mixture out on to a dish. You may need to add more
butter and a tablespoonful of oil to the pan. Turn up the heat and saute
the chopped mushrooms until they almost squeak. Turn the heat back down
to moderate, replace the onions (and garlic) in the pan, stir in the
flour and cook all together for a minute. Then, stirring continuously,
slowly add the milk, stirring until the sauce bubbles. Take the pan off
the heat, season with salt, pepper and nutmeg, and beat in the yolks,
one by one and beating very well between each. In a clean bowl whisk the
whites and, with a metal spoon, fold them quickly and thoroughly through
the mushroom sauce. Pour and scrape this into the souffle dish. If you
do this two or three hours in advance, cover the dish with clingfilm.
Remove the clingfilm before baking the souffle in a very hot oven --
420'F 220'C gas mark 7 for 40 minutes. The only -- slight -- problem
with a souffle is that it must be eaten as soon as it emerges from the
oven, otherwise it rapidly loses its spectacular height and sinks to
obscurity in its dish. Accompany with a good salad and warm bread.

* RESEARCHERS based at Northwestern University have developed a way to
test for hidden corrosion in planes using ultrasonic waves -- much like
ultrasound is used to image unborn babies in the womb.
The ultrasonic system has successfully detected corrosion in the
wingboxes of DC-9 aircraft and requires just 6% of the time now required
to manually open up the wing and visually inspect the wingboxes.
Ultrasonic sound waves have a frequency higher than the human ear can
detect. Two transducers are placed on the outside of the plane's wing at
two precise angles: one to send out the ultrasonic signals and a second
to receive the reflected signals.
Processing the signals provides detailed descriptions of the condition
of the materials at two different depths inside the wing.

Are the Brussels bureaucrats throwing their weight around? Or is there
method in their metric madness? Catherine Brown investigates
FIRST it was money -- remember old shillings? -- now it's measures.
The beginning of the end for quirky old lbs and pints as the law changes
to streamlined kilos and litres.
Tomorrow is M-day, and the first phase of metrication, when
pre-packaged food and drink (except for pints of beer and cider in pubs,
and pints of milk in glass bottles) changes.
Loose over-the-counter sales, have a reprieve, but only until January
1, 2000, when selling lbs and pints in any form becomes illegal.
My kitchen cupboard is already full of foods which are pre-packed in
metric quantities, but I still continue to think, shop, and cook in lbs
and ozs. I don't want to change. Why should I? Americans have resisted
several attempts by legislators, intent on tidying up weights and
measures, but old lbs and pints are still in good health. Some European
countries, supposedly metricated for years, continue to sell some foods
in lbs.
The march of metrication, of course, is about standardisation in
Europe. The Euro-sceptic camp, of course, are furious.
The gist of their argument is not just a sentimental one, about loss
of national identity, but largely about the compulsory aspect of the
metrication bill. Traders caught disobeying, are liable to a fine of up
to #5000, though there seems some doubt that errant traders will be so
harshly prosecuted.
A group of surveyors and valuers have already set up the Imperial
Measurements Preservation Society.
There is also the threat that the profiteers will take advantage of
the inevitable confusion. The temptation to round-up, when a kilo works
out at a little over two pounds, may prove irresistible.
If you meet such rip-offs, complain!, says Andy Moynihan, trading
standards controller with Glasgow Regional Council.
''Metric units are simple, easy-to-work-with measures, and they are
already all around us in existing food and drink,'' he argues. The other
plus which M-Day should bring us, he suggests, is an end to the
difficulty of working out price comparisons in the multiples. It has
been too easy in the past for them to produce a choice of 10 different
cheddar cheeses, and then confuse the real price differentials by
selling some in 8oz and others in 200g packs.
When Moynihan shops in the multiples he does a quick recce to see how
consistent the unit pricing is throughout the store.
Some are better than others, he says, but the most consistent he has
found is Sainsburys, the only multiple, so far, going the whole hog and
selling metric in both pre-packs and over-the-counter sales. Safeway,
Tesco, and Asda will keep lbs and ozs for loose products, while M &amp; S
will go metric for the butchery counters but stay imperial for
self-service sales of fresh produce.
For a rough guide to buying foods sold loose in metric: If you want a
quarter pound -- ask for a 100g (slightly less); for half a pound -- ask
for 250g (slightly more); for two pounds -- ask for a kilo (slightly
more); for a pint -- ask for half a litre (slightly less).

AT Marston's Brewery in Burton-on-Trent the unions are still a
powerful force, and despite the pressure under which they work the only
discordant note, a murmur, is when the occasional splutter of froth
puffs its way to the surface.
Management has not been without its dilemmas and a few years ago the
unions appeared to have no future and faced the axe. Most had been
broken up around Burton-on-Trent but Marston's still believed in the
value of these massive oak casks. They produce Pedigree Bitter, a beer
which does not meet with daylight until an elaborate, but one-time
traditional brewing process has been followed. Called the Burton Union
System, Marston's is the only brewery that ferments its beer this way.
Marston's was founded in 1834 at the Horningblow Brewery. In 1898 the
company amalgamated with John Thompson and Son Ltd and moved to the
Albion brewery which was built in 1875 and bears the traditional
red-brick costume of its Victorian era. The company still operates from
this brewery which has been designated a grade-two listed building.
Burton Unions were first discussed commercially in Walkers Patent of
1838 and the system of fermentation was used by all post-war Burton
breweries. The unions weigh 5cwt with a 150-gallon capacity and are
arranged in ''sets'' of 24 or 30 in a cast-iron or stainless-steel
frame.
At Marston's, fermentation starts in one of 27 traditional shallow
squares where the wort is held for 16-24 hours before it is dropped into
the union sets. As fermentation takes place, the yeast produces alcohol
and carbon dioxide which creates a pressure in the cask and that forces
the yeast and beer up through ''swan neck'' pipes set in the top of the
cask into the trough above. Here the yeast is retained while the beer
separates and returns to the fermenting casks. Fermentation takes about
five days.
The highly powdery strain of yeast used is special to the union system
and the way it works and reacts with the union is what creates and
develops the mature flavour evident in the beer. It is because of this
that Marston's has continued producing its beer using the union system;
to change the method of brewing would mean using a different yeast
strain which would affect the complex taste of the beer.
Apart from Pedigree Bitter at 4.5% ABV the brewery produces Owd
Rodger, a fruity dark ale at 7.6% ABV and Low C, a 4.2% ABV
72-calories-a-bottle beer for those on a slimming plan. India Export
Pale Ale, Albion Porter, Oyster Stout and Burton Strong Pale Ale form
part of the Head Brewer's Choice portfolio which appear in 500ml
bottles.
Marston's is certainly not in the same league as the big boys but they
compete well in a niche market producing a classic beer of fine quality
which is well worth sampling when it pays a visit.

* A TEAM of astronomers has used the Hubble Space Telescope to solve a
20-year mystery: what is the nature of an enormous number of faint
galaxies seen by the world's largest telescopes in the distant universe?
After a year and a half of using the repaired space telescope,
scientists have learned that the blue-coloured objects are actually
small, odd-shaped galaxies that become more numerous as astronomers look
deeper into space, and therefore farther back in time.
The faint galaxies are seen everywhere on the sky; astronomers using
ultra-powerful telescopes see tens of thousands of them in an area the
size of the full moon. Some of the galaxies are as distant as 10 billion
light years away. They emit blue light because they are in the process
of hatching many new stars at once, stars that are massive and very hot,
said Richard Griffiths, an astrophysicist who heads an international
project called the Medium Deep Survey.
The survey was taken with the Hubble Space Telescope's Wide Field
Planetary Camera-2. Astronomers aren't sure where all the faint galaxies
are today, because their light takes 10 billion years to reach us. They
may still be just as numerous as they were a few billion years ago but
are not as bright as they used to be, making them more difficult to see,
Griffiths says.
''Some of them probably self-destructed,'' Griffiths says. ''Massive
hot stars may become supernovas, causing gigantic explosions and driving
out interstellar gas that would normally form new stars. Without enough
raw material in a galaxy to form new stars, the galaxy essentially
dies,'' he says.
The Wide Field Planetary Camera-2 was part of a package of corrective
optics installed in December 1993, during a mission to repair an
image-blurring mirror flaw. Astronomers had to wait until the space
telescope's blurry vision was corrected before they could get a good
look at the galaxies.
''We've known about them for nearly two decades, but we didn't know
what they were,'' Griffiths says. ''We couldn't say anything about their
actual structure.''
The Medium Deep Survey's main goal was to learn the nature of the
faint blue galaxies. ''We've come a long way to solving that particular
problem,'' he says.
However, the survey data is yielding many additional cosmic fruits,
including insights into ''gravitational lenses'', the bending and
shaping of light waves by massive objects. The survey team has
discovered two such lenses; in each case, light from a faint blue galaxy
or quasar located exactly behind the centre of an elliptical galaxy is
distorted as it passes through the centre of the elliptical galaxy.

* THE ''recreational'' drug Ecstasy, already suspected of causing
brain damage, may do lasting harm by causing key nerve cells in the
brain to grow back abnormally, according to results of research on
animals at Johns Hopkins medical institution.
The findings support earlier indications that the drug MDMA, known to
users as Ecstasy, may cause lasting damage to nerves that produce
serotonin, an important chemical messenger in the human brain associated
with mood and personality traits.
''MDMA causes an abnormal regeneration, or rewiring, of the nerve
cells that release serotonin,'' says neurology professor George
Ricaurte, the study's senior author.
''The results are further evidence that people using high doses may be
putting themselves at significant risk of brain injury.''
In a 1994 study, Ricaurte led the first controlled human study with
MDMA. The results suggested users were vulnerable to the same type of
brain damage shown previously in animal studies. But researchers did not
know if the damaged serotonin nerve cells eventually recovered.
Results of the current study showed that the damaged cells recovered
abnormally in most of the monkeys and a few of the rats 12 to 18 months
after they received the drug. The cells recovered in some areas, but in
other areas the serotonin nerve fibres did not grow back or overgrew.
Researchers now are trying to determine why the nerve cells grow back
normally, abnormally or not at all, and whether the damaged nerve tissue
disrupts mood, memory, and other functions associated with serotonin.
Scientists also are trying to clarify serotonin's role in the brain
and its possible involvement in some mental disorders such as depression
and anxiety. MDMA users in Ricaurte's 1993 study were less hostile and
impulsive than a control group of people who had a similar drug
lifestyle but had not used MDMA. The drug, which is related to
amphetamine and mescaline, was first synthesised in 1914 in drug company
laboratories as a possible appetite suppressant.
* A TEAM of dedicated students have come up with an invention that
could shake civilisation to its very roots.
They have devoted their time in overcoming seemingly insuperable
problems like fluid migration and liquid ejection to perfect the latest
boon to mankind. It's a toaster pizza.
The food science students at Cornell University in New York believe
they have come up with a snack that could gives fast-food a turbo boost.
Once they licked the ''sauce-migration'' and ''squirt-out'' problems
they were on their way to perfecting the pop-up pizza.
Prototypes, are stuffed with cheese, tomato sauce, and pepperoni. They
require a minute and a half to cook at a medium setting in the average
toaster. Fluted edges keep the sauce and cheese from leaking into the
toaster. An acetylated monoglyceride barrier between the crust and the
sauce is the secret to the crisp texture, and a thick paste-type sauce
prevents ''squirt out'' when the consumer takes that all-important first
bite.
''They're healthier than a slice of pizza, lower in fat and crispy,
too,'' said Michael King, who chaired the development team at the
Agricultural Experiment Station in Geneva, NY.
''Survey results indicated crispness and convenience were the two
primary concerns, so that's what we went for in our toasted product. In
general, toasters and ovens give a much crisper product than microwave
ovens.''

* BOLETUS edulus, otherwise know as a ''penny bun'', is the mushroom
to look for this autumn. Commanding a high price in European markets the
Scottish penny bun crop hit a record at Strathspey Mushrooms last Sunday
when 1000kg were collected by freelance pickers.
Easy to recognise, with its chestnut brown cap and tubes, Strathspey
Mushroom wants rock-solid specimens between the size of a golf ball and
tennis ball, with no discolourations. They can be delivered fresh or
frozen to Strathspey Mushrooms, Seaforth Road Muir of Ord, or Kila,
Grampian Road, Aviemore. Phone 01479 810 573.

Iain White marvels at a Scottish haven that rests in a shimmering sea
of tranquility, maintains its Gaelic culture, and owns a runway that is
washed twice a day
AS YOU fly in low across the sparkling waters of the Little Minch, the
Isle of Barra appears like a beautiful green jewel at the end of the
long necklace of Hebridean islands. Even the knowledge that the airline
schedule is arranged around the tide-tables cannot prepare the visitor
for the excitement of landing on the wide strand of the cockleshell
beach of Traigh Mhor. The tiny airport terminal situated among the sand
dunes exudes an atmosphere of unreality and the sight of a fire engine
driving cattle off the runway, to allow the plane to take off, creates
the impression of being in a land of make-believe.
When the film Whisky Galore was made here in 1948 the island did
indeed become the setting for both fact and fiction. Sir Compton
Mackenzie's novel of the whisky-laden SS Politician, which sank off
nearby Eriskay, was filmed around Castlebay and the island's roads and
beaches became the romantic setting for one of British cinema's most
endearing productions. Those cinematic images of high-jinks and hilarity
are never far from the surface especially when the Barra Feis is in full
swing in June. The sound of bagpipes being practised in the back of
crofts is a precurser for an endless series of all-night ceilidhs around
the island.
The village of Castlebay is built in a natural sheltered harbour and
was once a thriving herring port with hundreds of boats filling the
anchorage. Nowadays only a handful of boats land seafood for export,
mainly to the Continent. However, when the ferry docks beside the
twelfth-century Kisimul Castle in the bay, you can almost believe that
most of the 1200 population have come to meet her. The village which
contains almost all the services for the island with shops, bank, post
office, and petrol station all situated in the main street, is
transformed into a frenetic hive of activity as precious commodities of
milk and bread are pounced on.
This sense of urgency, bewildering to visitors, is instilled by the
unpredictable nature of the weather; who knows when the next boat will
arrive. As the boat pulls out again the population melts away and the
village returns to its quiet torpor.
Barra is essentially a small-scale version of all that is attractive
in the Hebrides and because its circular road is only 12 miles long it
is possible to absorb the island-magic in a weekend. Touring the island
on foot or bicycle is the best method, allowing you to slow down and
enjoy the atmosphere of this tranquil isolation. Heading off up the west
coast brings you to some of the loveliest beaches in the Hebrides.
Halaman Bay has dangerous tides for swimming but is perfect for a long
walk along its deserted white sands. Backed by the machair land which
bursts into colour with a carpet of wild flowers in May and June the
Atlantic seaboard beaches continue on past Borve Point and up to Seal
Bay.
Alternatively, you can head inland at the township of Craigston, past
the thatched blackhouse museum, and cut across the middle of the island
to the east coast.
All around these coastal waters are numerous stunning beaches, none
more so than the long expanse of Traigh Eais which hugs the spit of land
behind the airport. As you approach this idyllic setting you will pass
the former home of the writer Compton Mackenzie who did so much for the
island through his literary work. Sadly his house now shares its
existence as a harling factory, using the seashells from the beach, and
the romance of the place is somewhat muted by the intrusive noise and
dust.
At the end of this deserted beach you can easily climb to the top of
Ben Eoligarry for stunning views across the shallow sandbanks to Eriskay
and South Uist, surrounded by the most glorious turquoise waters of the
Minch.
Barra takes its name from St Barr (Finbarr) who is believed to have
brought Christianity here from Iona. The present chapel of Cille Bharra
was built on the site of the original seventh-century monastic cell.
This small twelfth-century church contains ancient Norse runes and the
surrounding graveyard, in which Compton Mackenzie was buried, must have
one of the all-time great Hebridean views.
Returning through the fishing hamlet of Northbay, the character of the
island changes as the flat expanses of machair and beaches are replaced
by heather-covered hills and numerous rocky inlets of the east coast.
The scattered townships of Earsary, Skallary, and Brevig are where many
of the island crofters live, taking advantage of the sheltered rocky
bays where their boats can be tied up safely.
The dramatic coastal scenery here is mirrored by the massive heights
of Heaval (1260m) on whose steep side is perched the marble statue of
the Madonna and Child. From the summit of this hill the true beauty and
remoteness of these Isles is revealed, for on a clear day you can see
almost all of the Hebrides from the mountains of Harris in the north of
Berneray in the south, a vast panoramic view of land resting in a
shimmering sea of tranquility.
The Barrachs are very independent and protective of their native
island. When British Airways introduced a new plane on the flight from
Glasgow, the locals were sceptical and raised fears over its
performance. Many of them soon deserted the flights, exasperated by the
numerous cancellations and aborted landings in inclement weather.
Inevitably the much loved and trusted Twin Otter was reinstated
reinforcing the need for outside forces to listen to local knowledge.
The Gaelic culture of Barra is sustained by a rich store of folklore
and song, yet they are extremely welcoming to visitors. They also have a
wonderful sense of humour. On the controversial topic of the proposed
new concrete airstrip my taxi driver replied, ''. . . Well I'm not sure
. . . after all, it's the only runway in the world that gets washed
twice a day . . .''

MY eating habits change all the time which is why it's very difficult
to lose that one stone I've always wanted to get rid of. Breakfast is
often just pitta bread with jam or a banana, or a bowl of oat cereal
with skimmed milk, and a cup of tea. I can't drink coffee since I had
Hannah 16 months ago, it upsets me.
On location, by the time it's 8am I'm starving, so I'll have a bacon
or scrambled egg roll. Lunch at home will be toast and cheese. The
caterers on Rab C Nesbitt are brilliant and give you the full blow-out
for lunch. I might have a nice salad, or seafood, and always try and
have rice for energy rather than potatoes or pasta which make me feel
sleepy. I have a sweet tooth and always finish off any meal with
something sugary
I have to be careful what I eat: six months ago I was very unwell and
my acupuncturist told me to stay off fruit, raw vegetables and coffee
which is what you're supposed to eat when you want to lose weight. It
seems to have worked and I no longer get an upset stomach.
A typical dinner might be avocado and prawns, a lovely fresh sea trout
caught by my husband who's a fisherman, pasta with chicken and bacon and
an M&amp;S strawberry cheesecake.
I won't nibble between meals any more now that I'm eating properly,
but I will have a cup of tea mid-afternoon.
My favourite meal is my sister's recipe of monkfish with chilli sauce.
And I do a nice chicken casserole full of carrots, fresh herbs, potatoes
and parsnips -- I'm a bit crazy about parsnips.
I drink a lot of Evian water -- it fills you up too. And I like to
drink brandy or Chardonnay or Chablis, sometimes champagne.

PEDAL POWER
As Anvar Khan's sole-searching reveals, it's the funny-shaped thing at
the end of your leg (hee-hee!)
FEET, like prisoners of conscience, are often locked away for up to 16
hours a day, with no light, no water, no exercise, no TLC, and in
ill-fitting mincers. If what Leonardo da Vinci once called ''a
remarkable piece of engineering'' are treated any more badly, charities
will be set up to lend support, which is more than shoes are doing.
Feet are a great barometer of health. Skilled reflexologists can
determine whether someone has been infected by the 'flu or suffers from
migraines by feeling and massaging the sole of the foot.
Concrete pavements are bad for feet -- the human foot works better on
grassy earth -- and badly fitting footwear can create bad posture, and
then backache or spinal problems.
Mavala of London, Geneva, and Paris have launched The Swiss Foot Care
and Beauty Programme, a range of eight interactive products especially
formulated to ''beautify'' the feet, a pair of which walk an estimated
7000 steps a day. These include Smoothing Scrub Cream, 75ml (#7.50);
Conditioning Moisturiser, 75ml (#7.50); Refreshing Gel, 75ml (#6.50) and
Concentrated Foot Bath, 75ml (#4.50).
* Mavala of Switzerland Cosmetic range (right) includes Mini Colour
nail pots at #2.10; waterproof eye colour at #5 for their Crayon Lumiere
and #2.75 for the Kohl Kajal; Mavalips at #5.15.
DID YOU KNOW?
* DURING the third century, St Clement of Alexandria ordered women not
to reveal their toes in public in case any man should become inflamed
with desire. It is clear, Fergie should have listened to the lessons of
royalty before her. It was all very well going topless, but going
shoeless on that holiday with financial adviser John Bryan was the
absolute end.
* Freud and Jung declared that dreams involving shoes being forcibly
removed revealed a fear of castration. I thought it was guy's cars which
were supposed to represent their ego (as I thought it was called, when a
wee girl) and now realise how spot-on I was.
* In China, a country whose human rights are well-documented, the
barbaric act of foot-binding was banned only 70 years ago in 1928.

Time was when what was on the box was important, now it's the TV
itself that's become an object of desire. Joe Donnelly takes a look at
the new designs which don't even have to be switched on to make strong
style statements
TIME was when all televisions looked like pieces of furniture jammed
in the corner of the livingroom. They came on four spindly legs, had two
circular control knobs and some vertical and horizontal hold buttons at
the back. They matched the sideboard and the table because they were all
veneered in brown wood-effect.
Times changed, as they do, and televisions changed with them. The TV
became squat and functionally plastic, futuristic and very hi-tech. We
had flatter, squarer tubes, sets with speakers in the sides, on the top,
underneath, links to the stereo, sockets for video, hook-ups to a CD-i
set, but in recent years they've followed the Henry Ford colour
ordinance.
They can be any colour as long as they are black.
Now here's a change, a glimpse of the future which looks set to bring
the television set back, not as an item of furniture, but as a work of
art.
And why not? If Charles Rennie Mackintosh could make chairs and window
frames objects of artistic excellence, there's no reason why a
television set can't be good to look at while we're watching some of the
rubbish that passes for entertainment on the screens.
They don't have to be clumsy and wooden and they don't have to be
black boxes which match nothing except a teenager's wallpaper.
The new sets were conceived by some of the best young artists and
designers of the day and were unveiled recently at the Georges Pompidou
centre in Paris as part of a series of interactive communication events
run by Philips, the Dutch-based multinational.
The theme was Television at the Crossroads and the exhibition showed
some of the radical new concepts in styling in shape, colour, and
materials by the young Philips designers under guidance of three
acclaimed masters of design, architects and writers Allessandro Mendini
and Andrea Branzi, and Philips own director of corporate design Stefano
Marzano.
The Philips forum in Paris offers ideas of what the next-but-one
generation of televisions may look like, what their role in the home may
be, and what benefits we expect them to bring us. Sixteen original TV
concepts formed part of the display including the cat and mouse fun set
for the kids to highly visual pieces of latter-day communications
sculpture.
The show also included ideas on how televisions will be used in the
future. Philips says that tele-services such as shopping, phoning,
banking, and even finding a job will soon be commonplace, but that
future generations will use the set in more unusual ways, as a reading
lamp, an aid to putting on make-up, or just to create an atmosphere.
Whatever they are used for, we at Frontiers found some of them
visually stunning, and we thought we'd just share this aspect of the
future with you.
These sets will not be in our TV showrooms for some time, but
hopefully, in the not too distant future, some of them will be available
to buy, and to bring some hi-tech artistry to the box in the corner.
Wouldn't it be nice to be able to sit back and just watch the telly .
. . . without having to switch the darned thing on?
And by the way, perhaps we spoke too soon when we mentioned the bygone
days of the old wood-veneer television which was once the apotheosis of
all hi-tech fashion.
Philips, despite what their artists might create for the cutting edge
of visual technology, tell us that their classic woodstyling televisions
have made a successful comeback and are going from strength to strength.
Their wooden flagship is the 6770C Classicline, housed in Sapele and
comes with matching cabinet and smoked glass doors with scart, nicam and
VHS interface, all for #1099.
If we can't have the future right now, maybe we should settle for
nostalgia.
* BBC TV and radio have joined the interactive media trail as part of
a trial for on-screen entertainment, shopping, banking and other
services in Cambridge. BBC programmes are available on demand to 100
homes as part of the experiment run by a consortium of companies headed
by Online Media, a division of Acorn Computer.
The Cambridge digital interactive TV trial involves major companies
including Anglia, NatWest, NOP research group, the Post Office, and
Tesco stores. Set-top boxes have been installed to the television cable
feed to give users a variety of interactive services from a local
control centre. The on-demand services include movies, education, games,
news, documentaries and weather.
* UNIVERSITIES in the UK will go on-line this month in two new access
services. ExpertNet and HE News, both free services are the latest
developments in the drive by the Committee of Vice Chancellors and
Principals to use the internet to offer increased access to services and
staff.
ExpertNet is a service for people -- especially journalists seeking
expert comment on any subject. HE News is a free internet service
offering information on latest developments in higher education and
university innovation.
* EDINBURGH'S higher education institutions and Stirling University
have launched a new metropolitan area network called EastMAN designed to
put them at the forefront of high-speed telecommunications. The network
links up the campuses of Edinburgh, Heriot-Watt, Napier, Edinburgh
College of Art, Moray House, Queen Margaret, and Stirling including
links to wider academic community networks.
The system will enable new developments in distance learning, video
conferencing and other interactive applications including multi-location
tutorials. The new optical fibre network is leased from Scottish
Telecom, a subsidiary of Scottish Power.
* STREAM International are marketing the Stream User Guide to
Microsoft Windows for corporate licence users. The guide is designed to
cut the number of calls from Windows users to support groups asking for
technical guidance. The books are priced at #14.95 and are said to
bridge the gap between the M-Soft standard documentation and the more
in-depth resource kit. Hopefully the next generation of software will
come complete with guidance for every eventuality which will save us
users from lashing out more dough on yet more guidance manuals.

* ''EVER since I got my hands on the first sample bottle of Estee
Lauder pleasures I have adored it'' says Elizabeth Hurley now filming
down under in the kangaroo state, as far away from Britain and America
and Hugh Grant as she can get. ''I now never leave the house without
smothering myself in both the body lotion and the perfume!''
The woman who was humiliated by her long-term boyfriend going with a
prostitute, goes on: ''I think it is so important to be open to all the
possibilities for pleasure in life. The sheer prettiness, the elegance,
the spirit of Estee Lauder pleasures is an exciting example of how we
can live. It informs us about our natural sexuality and how we don't
want to miss out on a single, wonderful thing.''
It gets worse.
''I am never happier than when I am in my garden at home and now I can
pretend I am wherever I happen to be.'' We'll not try to make sense of
this last statement. But the following needs no clarification.
''The design of the bottle is exquisite,'' Ms Hurley continues. ''The
curve of the glass is very sensual and looks divine on your dressing
table.'' You said it, Liz.
* The UK launch date for 'pleasures' by Estee Lauder is October 2. Eau
de Parfum Spray, 15ml #17.50, 30ml #25; Parfum 7ml is #55; and Perfumed
Body Lotion, 250ml #27.50.

ENERGY and business mandarins were in the pursuit of power, quite
literally, when they met in Glasgow on Thursday this week.
They gathered for a planning day, drawn from individuals from key
organisations to formulate a strategy for replacing a sizeable
proportion of fossil-fuelled energy with renewable power within the next
15 years.
More than two dozen guests were invited to the meeting on RESET, the
Renewable Energy Strategies for European Towns, a joint venture between
Glasgow and its twin city of Turin along with Barcelona, Lyon, and St
Petersburg. The city council has already been awarded EC funding for the
project and the planning day was intended to be a lively forum for
identifying the benefits of renewable energy initiatives and the hurdles
they might face.
Each of the RESET partner cities undertook a case study and in Glasgow
the objective is to investigate the feasibility of establishing a
renewable energy design assistance centre to advise architects,
designers, and developers on incorporating new technologies in buildings
and projects.
Recently Frontiers reported on the solar power drive by Greenpeace who
powered up the Cybercafe in Edinburgh last month using photo-voltaic
solar panels as part of their campaign against global pollution from
power generation. The solar panels are only one form of renewable energy
generation. Others have recently had a bad press, particularly the
Osprey wave-generation project which took to the water like a lame duck.
Wind-power generators, which can be impressive as well as successful,
particularly in the west of the country, have had their detractors.
However, Greenpeace claim that solar panels installed on buildings
were incorporated into the Easthall housing project in Easterhouse. The
city council is also working with the Mackintosh School of Architecture
and Energy Action Scotland to look at the potential of using attics as
pre-heat sun buffer spaces.
Hopefully the high-powered RESET meeting in the St Mungo Museum will
help to give Glasgow the power-start to see it through the next century.

* FOR the confused and fed-up, a quick guide to some of the terms and
ingredients you'll find in treatment make-up products. Alpha hydroxy
acids, which can come from synthetic or natural sources, are used in
anti-ageing products to loosen and remove dead outer layers of skin,
making skin feel softer and look brighter. Ceramides are lipids which
work to keep moisture levels in the skin at their peak. Free Radicals
are the destructive, oxidised cells formed by ultra-violet (UV) light,
pollution, and cigarette smoke. They are believed to damage the skin and
cause premature ageing. Antioxidants neutralise the destructive effect
of free radicals. Powerful antioxidants include vitamins C and E.

LET'S get right down to basics. What lurks deep down below the worsted
tailoring, the blue jeans and overalls in which men present themselves
to the outside world? Purely in the interest of scienific research, you
understand, an enthusiastic team of volunteers has gone undercover this
week to investigate one of the great grey areas of modern life. Rhona,
Carol, Lesley, Susan, and Morag have unzipped the mysteries of underwear
for modern men.
Four out of these five cannot bear the sight of novelty boxer shorts,
printed with cavorting pigs, frogs a-leaping, or rampant lions. (No
sniggering, please.) Susan considers string vests ''totally sex-proof''.
And skimpy G-strings, so effective in a Chippendales review, are
declared ''unsuitable for a suburban bedroom.'' Sloggies are rated
''borderline'' by Carol, who admires the advertising image. But
something baggy, ill-fitting and in need of repair is considered
depressingly average.
Yet, having come to terms with deodorant, moisturiser and hair gel,
modern man must now change his underwear. Calvin Klein has already put
his stamp on a million bottoms and brought the classic Y-fronted brief
back to prominence. Our researchers enthused equally about the many
alternatives now available from other designers. Even solid old St
Michael - surely the patron saint of intimate apparel - scored highly
with a new range of cotton-Lycra T-shirts and boxer-trunks.
Each of our researchers' preferred choices (pictured here) is cut to
athletic precision in pure white cotton or cotton-Lycra. ''Best
looking'', confirms Rhona. ''Best fitting'', adds Susan. ''Best
laundered by the wearer himself'', corrects Lesley.

Jack McLean reveals the secrets of whisky labels that tell you not
only the production process and origin of the Scotch, but also an
insight into some grand history
STAIRHEID Dynamite it was titled. Said the label: ''Strength 150%
proof. Worst Scotch Whisky. Blended and bottled by two Celtic supporters
in the Boyne Distillery, Brigton.'' The elaborate label continued:
''Applied externally it is ideal for removal of corns, warts, and
bunions. Old-age pensioners and expectant women are warned against
drinking the whisky unless prescribed by a doctor . . . ''
What a lot of silly labels for Scotch there are too, for the Dynamite
is not the only one. I liked the one titled ''Inebriated Newt'' which
has a six-colour label with a cheery drawing of what looked half like a
pissed tadpole, and half of a suddenly sensible Ken Livingstone with a
kilt tied around it/him. Some of the names of the labels were nice
outside of silly drawings. Brahms and Liszt. Pleasant Plucker. There can
be a lot of fun taking the laldy out of the whisky industry, and an
industry which takes itself very seriously when it comes to otiose
notions of recent aristocracy. Never forget that the Scotch whisky
business is of very recent date indeed, and that the whisky barons were
parvenus who would make the beer barons look like old money. Don't
believe for a single minute anything which anybody in the Scotch
business tells you about the great traditions of their old families,
particularly the families and traditions.
Scotch is very ancient indeed and goes back to Ireland where poteen is
still made but Scotch is of recent date, especially the commercial trade
of it. As late as 1840 there was no commercially made Scotch. When Queen
Victoria gave the water of life a sort of imprimatur Scotch gradually
began to take off. For most of the century before the 1840s claret was
the cup and whisky was ill-regarded.
A varied history Scotch has. For many years it was horribly
adulterated -- something which yet occurs in many parts of the world
where so-called ''whisky'' is manufactured, but cannot happen in
Scotland. If it says Scotch on the label then it means it. And the label
is incredibly important. More than any other piece of paper or foil in
the world, a Scotch whisky label is necessary -- more important than a
passport. There are important things to be read on a whisky label, more
than aesthetics. The whisky label has got to say Made in Scotland, if it
is made in Scotland. It has got to give the proof, and where it is from.
Oddly, it doesn't have to give its age but this is a daftness in the
industry because you can sell almost any distillation in Europe at any
age at all and all Scotches are aged, in cask, for many years. Scotch
even has standards beyond which regulations would be denied. The Isle of
Skye whisky, for instance, is a blended whisky of which every whisky,
including its grains, are at least eight years old.
This does not, in fact, make for a better or a smoother whisky -- in
fact the only single grain whisky in Scotland, Cameron Brig, is a very
mellow whisky indeed, while the heavy Islay malts can be coarse and
difficult for a new palate. But there is more needed for a whisky label.
It also has to tell you where it is from, where it is bottled, and
where it originated in cask. Most good whiskies, blended or not, will
tell you if sherry, redwood, or oak casks were used. If a whisky label
tells you all this, it also tells you, strangely, of history.
For the history of Scotch is really rather romantic. It is also
seriously venal and villainous. Seagrams spent $7m in one year's
advertising to pay for the design of labels, yet only had six people
designing. They came up with a whisky called Black Watch which was a
disaster. On the other hand, Duart Castle, from Mull, spent about six
quid. All right, that was a disaster too, but it cost a million times
less.
Now to labels and to a certain John M La Dell and romanticism. Nobody
who has ever been in the Scotch whisky industry remains untouched by
romanticism, apart from those bloody Australian and North American
accountants who think of Scotland as a balance sheet in the rain.
Nobody. La Dell is in fact English, born in Kent, and started off like
many people in Scotch, outside of the industry. In 1965 he moved to
Paisley, for Chivas Brothers. Shortly afterwards he went to New York
where he discovered that he had to know everything, from glass
manufacture, to 12-colour printing to design to the product itself. ''I
liked the bottle, the label, that was difficult to make. When we went
into the presentation tubes for the bottles I was in heaven. You could
think up anything and finally get it done. The accountants went spare
because suddenly they had art on their hands.''
And then he came out with a quote I would have loved to make myself.
''Whisky packaging is difficult technically and getting harder all the
time, and needs technological expertise which places it at the top level
of the entire packaging industry. The only thing hand-made about Scotch
is the Scotch.'' And he is right.
John has recently written a book, looked at by a number of publishers
now vying with each other for the rights, (Scotland's Mainstream looks
likely to win it), on what at first seems a mundane and indeed recondite
subject, the history of whisky labels. Few whisky companies ever
bothered to collect their own labels, and none has collected them all.
La Dell has an awesome collection and knows the history of them.
Some of the romance of the labels is twentieth century; there is no
romance really before it. You can forget all about the old Scotches of
the past because there weren't any. They would boil an old rat in ethyl
alcohol and a handful of barley and call it usige bhea in the old days
and the old language.
During the Prohibition days in the United States the Scotch was
transported to Bermuda, the Bahamas, anywhere in the West Indies,
Canada, Joe Kennedy, later anti-Brit American Ambassador and daddy of
the sanctified President John F., made most of his fortune in
rum-running, or rather whisky. Much of his stock was Red Hackle and
Cutty Sark.
Cutty Sark's label was designed by Francis Berry of Berry Brothers and
showed an illustration taken from the famous China tea clipper of that
name, a proto for many of the old ships used for illegal shipping of the
demon drink. The launch of Cutty Sark, in 1923, in the States has ever
since made it a brand leader there. So too was the rather neat Red
Hackle label, which was quite decorative.
Herein lies a bit of British history. Whisky production in Scotland
all but ceased during the war, but when the two brands came back to the
UK after it they had unfortunately been cut with additives, including
devastating industrial alcohol, by American bootleggers, and both blends
have ever been branded with a reputation for roughness, very unfairly.
Yet they were both re-labelled extensively and continue to be so, every
couple of years.
Changes of labels are, by and large, ruinous, and certainly changes of
names are. Every label has a subtle shift over the years. A Hundred
Pipers -- a well-known brand which should have done rather better over
the years -- has shifted so often in its label that nobody recognises it
anymore.
Haig and Haig stopped their Dimple bottle and lost an entire market
throughout Europe. Worst of all many whisky companies lost faith in
their products, let alone their packaging. Thus the seventies and
eighties saw new streamlined bottles designed for new-look youth. It was
a disaster.
Yet there were people out there, usually small companies and small
distributors who saw a market and recent years has seen some
considerable changes in rather charming brands brought out with a
general increase in design standards. Not all of these companies, La
Dell told me, did all that well. ''Sheriff's tried to kick off as a
South American export and spent a fortune on foil labels with a design
which would make you eat yourself. They never bottled a bottle: the cost
of the label was four times more than the whisky. In fact it was
damn-near as much as the duty.'' Sheriff's was a brand that never was,
like Glen Gordon or The Keith. The labels were grand and the whisky
delectable. The companies incompetent.
In the eighties the whisky firms started up attempts to ''modernise''
their image. This is ever a mistake. No matter how hard the whisky
people try they will never be able, in my view, to persuade young
people, or indeed most women, to drink whisky. It is a difficult drink,
designed for the sort of ruined and sophisticated taste buds which only
older males are likely to develop and possess.
Thus we have the grouse and the ptarmigan, the deer antlers, the
Bonnie Prince Charlie, the tartan round the shoulder of the bottle, the
invented history of it all.
The labels which La Dell has collected display the way that not only
whisky saw itself, but the way Scottish males -- at their most powerful,
just when they climb to the top of their mountains, just at their
male-est, just when they feel a real Scotland -- see their country.
La Dell, a packaging pioneer in many an industry but especially in
Scotch, told me of what these images were. An ex-silversmith, he had
experience not only of design but of production techniques. He needed a
lot of knowledge too -- Royal Salute, the de-luxe blend which comes in
velvet bags and all sorts of other trappings, costs a fortune in
packaging.
But packaging takes all forms too and sometimes the most bucolic is
the the most effective. Of all the packaging I know I like the restraint
of Glenmorangie for the malts best, its douce and discreet buff and
faded orange, like an old stamp in a stamp album you discover in the
loft. But of every single label on a whisky bottle give me a whisky
which my father preferred above them all, Laphraoig, and which I would
swop myself at any time for a swig of TCP which it frankly, I think,
tastes of.
It is a simple lettered label: no 12-colour printing job. Black on
white. Clear and simple. And somehow utterly ravishing. The very man for
whisky and couldn't do better.

Helen Smailes looks at the work and commitment of figure painter John
Zephaniah Bell.
WITH the dismissive words, ''Who J Z Bell is we know not -- oh, a
Scot!'' an English reviewer of 1832 wrote out of history one of the most
versatile Scottish figure painters of the nineteenth century. Bell's
commitment to experimentation and his refusal to compromise virtually
guaranteed that he would end his career in impoverished obscurity as a
London-based Scot who did not make good. Yet, at the outset, he had
shown unusual promise.
Born in Dundee in 1794, he was the son of a local businessman and the
uncle of Arthur Bell, founder of the Afore Ye Go distillery. Most
unusually for a Scottish artist of his generation, John Zephaniah
abandoned his studies at the Royal Academy in London in order to train
in the Paris studio of Baron Gros. Then, while in Rome in 1825-26, he
learned the technique of fresco painting from the brotherhood of German
history painters known as the Nazarenes.
On returning to Scotland, he settled in Edinburgh where he competed
with Watson Gordon for a share of the middle-class patronage for
portraiture. As a decorative artist, he had no serious rivals and was
hailed by Wilkie, rather prematurely -- as ''the reviver of painting in
fresco in Scotland''. Bell's first important commission for a fresco at
Cortachy for the ninth Earl of Airlie was followed by a second in 1832
for an Italianate ceiling at Muirhouse Mansion near Granton.
Bell's enterprises as a fresco painter were interrupted by an
extraordinary excursion to Portugal. In 1833, at the height of the
Portuguese Civil War, he sailed for Lisbon with a troop of Scottish
mercenaries recruited by his younger brother, a Glasgow merchant. During
the siege of Lisbon he painted an official portrait of the young Queen
Maria II. Today this hangs in the Town Hall of Oporto.
Lasting success continued to elude him. In 1837, Wilkie secured for
Bell a prestigious appointment as the first Master of the new Manchester
School of Design in the premises currently occupied by Manchester City
Art Gallery. In 1843, however, Bell was forced into resignation by his
own refusal to conform to government education policies. Undeterred, he
set up a private academy in London to provide the continental-style
curriculum which he himself had followed in Paris.
He had still not abandoned his earlier ambitions to achieve
recognition as a history painter in the grand manner. The immediate
attraction of London was the prospect of State patronage for history
painting in fresco offered by the public competitions for the decoration
of the new Palace of Westminster. A prize winner in the first
competition, he was finally passed over in what was probably the most
humiliating reverse of his entire career.
The few pictures which have survived from Bell's later years are
mainly portraits. Two of the most intriguing are the portraits of the
Dundee surgeon Dr John Crichton (about 1841) and of Michael Faraday
(1852) in the McManus Galleries and the Hunterian Art Gallery
respectively. Both Crichton and Faraday belonged to the fundamentalist
Glasite church which had originated as a breakaway sect of the Church of
Scotland in eighteenth-century Dundee. Bell's father was a Glasite and
the artist himself almost certainly joined the branch church in London.
At least among his co-religionists Bell could be assured of patronage
for portrait commissions which might not be forthcoming elsewhere!

* THE Big Interview, No. 4: ANDRO' Melvin (Darien adventurer),
mid-Atlantic, Autumn, 1698.
Myths: Our little fleet has now left the Forth far behind and the
journey to Darien, to the land we plan to call New Caledonia, is well
underway. Do you as a councilman sense any lessening of enthusiasm for
this great adventure among the colonists?
Melvin: Not at all, if anything, and despite the storms, indifferent
food and anticipated deaths since we left Madeira, it seems with every
mile that brings us nearer to our goal that spirits lift accordingly.
Myths: Although the departure from Scotland was enthusiastic and
spectacular you must have heard the whispers in the days before sailing
to the effect that Darien may not be the paradise which the likes of
Lionel Wafer decribed -- fertile land, blue water, white sand and
abundant wildlife?
Melvin: As a representtive of the Scottish media you should know
better than most just how much the East India merchants of London have
done to try to undermine our expedition. They see us as a trading threat
in the Caribbean despite our express intention to co-exist with our
neighbours. Darien is not paradise, but we have good reason to believe
it may be our promised land.
Myths: We understand that you and the council have been spending much
of your time on board the St Andrew framing a draft constitution for the
new colony. Are you able to give us any idea of what it will contain?
Melvin: As I say, co-existence is a keynote. It is no secret that we
wish the merchant ships of all nations to be free to come and go through
our port without harassment. It is our hope that all manner of persons,
of whatever nation or people should be equally free and we also wish a
full and free liberty of conscience in matters of religion.
Myths: Lack of co-operation from English merchants and settlements may
be one thing but are you also prepared for the reaction of the Spanish
who are so well established in Central America and around Darien in
particular and use the area, we are told, for trans-shipment of gold.
Melvin: Our expedition has the authority of the Scottish Parliament
and, as you know, the goodwill of the Scottish nation, #400,000, half of
Scotland's circulating capital, has been pledged to our expedition. We
remain confident that the Spanish authorities will recognise the
difference between honest, presbyterian endeavour and the grasping
piracy of English buccaneers.
Myths: There have been suggestions that the work which lies ahead in
establishing the settlement may be too rigorous for the younger sons of
the landed gentry who have volunteered in such large numbers. Is this
not a source of anxiety?
Melvin: They are enthusiastic and committed to this venture and that
is important above all else.
Myths: Many commentators are surprised to find that you are travelling
to one of the warmest parts of the world carrying woollen hose, plaid
and wigs as trade items. Bad forward planning, perhaps?
Melvin: Detractors, as I indicated, are everywhere. I think you'll
find that Scotland will soon have a foothold in Central America which
will last for a thousand years.
* After a hellish struggle against the jungle environment and the
Spanish, the Darien colony of New Caledonia was finally abandoned on
April 1, 1700.

PREDILECTIONS
Homosexuality: A History. Colin Spencer, Fourth Estate, #20.
THE title of this book expresses an extraordinary ambition. In his
foreword, Colin Spencer says that to write a comprehensive history of
his subject ''would fill at least 24 volumes''. This is a wild
understatement. The principal New York gay bookstore has colossal shelf
space, and every inch of it is filled with books on some aspect of
gayness or lesbianism.
Spencer was bound to fail in his attempt to cover such a vast topic in
400 pages. But this book is a heroic failure. Clearly the product of
many years' reading and reflection, its first half moves with speed and
accuracy over a huge range of cultures. The berdaches of Native American
tribes are discussed in the same chapter as the references to
homosexuality in Egyptian mythology, and the romanticisation of male
love in the early Chinese civilisation. The material on Greece and Rome
is (or at least ought to be) familiar to anyone who knows the history of
our own civilisation, but it is intriguing to be reminded that the
ancient Celts ''practised extensive male sexual coupling'' -- a feature
of Celtic culture which I feel is unlikely to be revived in the near
future in the Outer Isles.
Throughout its first millennium Christianity was far more ambiguous
about homosexuality than it subsequently became. Spencer follows the
late John Boswell in locating a rapid development of intolerance in the
twelfth century. Meanwhile, however, the Chinese continued to celebrate
male love (''The love of the cut sleeve'' -- so called because the Han
Emperor Ai cut off his sleeve rather than wake the lover who was
sleeping across it), and the Samurai of Japan observed the complex
chivalric code of shudo, centred on the love of young men.
The second half of the book focuses on western civilisation, and
particularly England. Spencer demolishes the ridiculous idea that the
homosexual identity only emerged in the late nineteenth century (when it
was first named as such). Before 1499 Marsilio Ficino noted that ''some
men naturally love males''. There is no doubt that people who were
recognisably homosexual in the modern sense were part of society as
early as the Renaissance -- including both Leonardo and Michelangelo.
Spencer deplores the division since then of sexuality into
''heterosexual'' and ''homosexual.'' Indeed in some respects this book
might have been more accurately entitled ''Bisexuality'', since he
believes that in a non-repressive society most people would relate, in
different ways, to both sexes. His analysis, however, of why the
division took place, and the subsequent reaction of homophobia, owes
much to a dated semi-Marxist blaming of ''capitalism'' which fails to
convince.
The book is weakest on the events of Spencer's own lifetime, where he
is simply overwhelmed by the mass of material he is trying to summarise.
Within 12 pages we move from the establishment of the Wolfenden
Committee in 1954 to the first reports of Aids in 1981. He is also
strangely pessimistic about the current situation, alleging that British
society has become ''more homophobic'' and that this trend is likely to
continue. This is a very odd description of a society which now offers
more freedom for the expression of same-sex love than has been possible
in the west for a millennium and a half. Moreover Spencer is way off
beam in once again blaming capitalism for modern homophobia. In the last
25 years lesbians and gays have brilliantly exploited the liberating
potential of capitalism to release the energies of our community,
creating innumerable ventures where previously there was nothing.
This is not say, of course, that the enemies of love and freedom do
not remain vocal and bitter -- as readers of The Herald have cause to
know. It's very regrettable that the cover of this book shows two young
men fresh from swimming, which means that it is being targeted directly
at the gay market. I hope a paperback will follow at a more reasonable
price, with a cover designed to attract heterosexual readers as well. It
is people whose knowledge of the subject is limited who would most
benefit from Spencer's exhilarating coverage of a facet of human life
which is, always has been, and always will be universal.

BIOGRAPHY
Michael Foot. H.G.: THE HISTORY OF MR WELLS. Doubleday, #20.
LIKE Edith Piaf, H G Wells regretted nothing. ''I've done nothing I am
ashamed of,'' he observed of his affair with Amber Reeves who gave birth
to his illegitimate daughter Anna in 1909. Michael Foot thinks Wells
loved to enlarge his experience of life and, sure enough, he always
turned a tale to his own advantage when reflecting on romance. Amber was
re-created in the image of the eponymous heroine of Ann Veronica (1909),
a novel considered deeply shocking in its day.
Foot insists Ann Veronica was not Amber but she was. Ann in fiction
was a Fabian as Amber was in fact. Ann falls for a biology tutor which
reminds the reader how Wells kicked off his literary career with A
Text-book of Biology (1893). Ann, with brains and beauty, is ''eager for
freedom and life'' and so was Amber. Ann gets freedom and life, Amber
got married to a fellow Fabian other than the married author she adored.
In Experiment in Autobiography (1934) -- ''one of the greatest
literary autobiographies ever written'' according to Foot -- Wells
boasted: ''I found nothing for self-reproach in my private conduct''. In
a letter to Bernard Shaw, on the subject of sexual morality, Wells
wrote: ''The more I think you over the more it comes home to me what an
unmitigated middle Victorian ass you are . . . You don't know, as I do,
in blood and substance, lust, failure, shame, hate, love and creative
passion''. Wells thought everyone out of step but himself and was a most
self-righteous man of the left. Fascinated by Wells's self-confidently
swaggering style, Foot has written a biography that follows
affectionately in Wells's footsteps.
''My hero'' is how Foot introduces the subject of this biography so
Wells, object of adoration, joins other heroes honoured by Foot in his
books -- Swift (see The Pen and the Sword), Bevan (see Aneurin Bevan),
Byron (see The Politics of Paradise), Hazlitt (see any book written by
Foot including this in which Wells takes his place ''among the haters of
hypocrisy in our literature, with Byron and Hazlitt at their head'').
Wells, beneath contempt for such critics as Malcolm Muggeridge who
eccentrically condemned the twice-married and much-mistressed author as
a misogynist, is above criticism for Foot.
Wells, as seen by Foot, was a shaper of democratic socialism, a
preacher of ''true internationalism'', one of ''the finest upholders of
the humanist tradition'', a great man humbly born in Kent ''where
Socialism was also born'', a genius who ''remained until his dying day a
servant of truth, a champion of youth, and a man who could not live
without the companionship of women -- some of them, in his case, among
the most powerful and attractive women of the century''. Foot met two of
Wells's mistresses -- Rebecca West and Moura Budberg -- and admired them
both. He also met the man himself and will not hear a word against him,
or her in the case of Rebecca West.
At the opening of Anthony West's novel Heritage (1955) narrator
Richard Savage lives in London with his mother Naomi, an actress.
Richard is an illegitimate child and when he goes to school he learns
the identity of his dad and contemplates ''the strange and unexpected
discovery that my father was Max Town (who) was divided from me by
something harder to cross than a mere row of footlights, a barrier of
print and a reputation. I had seen his photograph beside feature
articles on the League of Nations and similar subjects of political
aspect in the daily papers, a darkly foreboding, serious, public face,
and I had seen his name on the backs of books''.
As West acknowledged in the first British edition of Heritage (1984)
Max Town and Naomi Savage were intended as portraits of his parents,
Wells and Rebecca West, who met in 1912 when H G, married to Jane
Robbins, read Rebecca's review of his novel Marriage and embarked on an
adulterous affair that resulted in the birth of Anthony West in 1914.
If Wells got off relatively lightly in Heritage, Rebecca West was
savaged in name and nature as Naomi Savage. When Richard Savage tells
his mother of his own literary aspirations, she expresses her fury in a
series of leading questions: ''What have I done to deserve such a child?
. . . This isn't one of Max's ideas, is it? He hasn't put you up to
choosing this dreadful career, has he?'' Naomi Savage is, the narrator
concludes, ''an absolutely indifferent (mother) who had a child by
mistake''.
This will not do for Foot. He celebrates the love of H G and Rebecca
as a triumph for socialism. They had a marriage of emancipated minds and
cared for good companionship: ''That was what their Socialism was, and
that is what all Socialism should be . . . So this is a book about
Socialism''. As for Anthony West, Foot comes down hard on him as an
exceptionally bitter bastard: ''geniality and good humour were
positively not the qualities which Anthony inherited from his parents''.
We must surely accept that Anthony knew his own mother, a woman he felt
was out to ruin his life by making it difficult for him to create a
career and impossible for Heritage to appear in England while she was
still alive.
As for other women in Wells's life, Foot wonders why one did not marry
him when she had the chance. Moura Budberg was Wells's guide and
interpreter when he visited the Soviet Union in September 1920. She
later came to London and Wells noted: ''She will live with me, dine with
me, sleep with me, but she won't marry me.'' Foot answers his own
question when considering the part Budberg played in Wells's life as a
stimulating woman who embraced H G as an intellectual proposition but
refused to accept his marital proposals: ''Why did she refuse? The
answer is that she loved him and she loved her independence, too''.
That's that. No hint that Wells might have been the impossibly
irritating man described by Anthony West. Wells, in this book, can do no
wrong.
Wells was a wonderful writer and Foot does justice to his genius in
loving descriptions of the books. This is no critical biography but a
tribute from one gifted literary socialist to another. A labour of love.

Festive feasting can be chaotic without ample planning. Special travel
correspondent Katie Wood suggests options to make this Christmas period
a jolly occasion.
I KNOW, discussing Christmas before the leaves have decently turned is
obscene, but if you spent last Christmas mouthing ''never again'', now
is the time to make sure you don't have to suffer again this year by
booking a break and letting someone else do all that work. Grand
Heritage Hotels offer the sort of log fire, chestnut roasting,
four-poster experience that everyone would ideally like at Christmas and
they've just brought out their Festive packages brochure. Choose from 32
country houses. A sample price is #275 per person for a three-day stay
at the Boar's Head Hotel in Yorkshire, all meals, entertainments and
accommodation included. Call 0171 376 1777.
* AVRO'S, the UK's largest dedicated seat-only operator, has launched
its winter 1995-96 programme from Glasgow Airport to seven destinations.
Sample prices are Malaga for #124 return on November 19 or 26. Children
cost #15 less than the adult fare up until 18 years. There's no limit to
the number of children in the party provided they are accompanied by one
adult and the booking is made prior to October 1, 1995. Bookings can be
made through travel agents or by calling 0141 303 0303.
* IF you've returned from a holiday which necessitated a claim on your
travel insurance, and on reading the small print find that you're not
covered half as well as you thought, it will come as good news to learn
that the Association of British Insurers, Association of Travel
Insurance Intermediaries, and ABTA are working together to produce new
procedures that will give the consumer a far better deal. You can expect
a checklist drawing attention to exclusion clauses and putting the
policy in plain English. Club Direct claim to be the first travel
insurance company to gain commendation from the plain English Society.
* STILL on an insurance note, the increasingly large number of
footloose under 35s who spend a year or so globetrotting should take
note that Citybond Travel Consultants has launched a new policy called
Young Traveller aimed precisely at those on a round-the-world trip.
Available to the 16-35 age group the premium is #195 for 12 months. Call
them on 0181 771 6431. (And don't forget to pack a copy of the
HarperCollins Paperback Globetrotter's Bible!).
* ANOTHER good policy has come on the market from Club Direct. Their
annual multi-trip packages are exceptionally good value at just #45 for
an adult making unlimited European trips for a year, while a family --
two adults and an unlimited number of children -- starts at #75, rising
to #125 for worldwide cover. Travellers can ''upgrade'' their cover. If,
for example, they start off with a European policy but then decide to
travel further afield, they can top up to worldwide cover. For

Hugh Ouston starts a new column with a walk in Glen Feshie
IT was late May and I was looking for wilderness. Glen Feshie seemed a
good place to search. The prettiest of the Cairngorm glens, this had
become a touchstone of our attitude to wild land when it had been the
subject of the second most publicised change of landownership in the
past year. Only the great estate of Mar Lodge on the other side of the
Cairngorms had generated more interest. Even when the National Trust
saved Mar Lodge ''for the nation'' the controversy over its use by
people, that is to say the purpose of the land, continued. Who, after
all, is the nation? That same controversy had illuminated the sale of
the long, wide glen that now lay carved before me, its depths lit by a
watery light behind the rainstorm which brushed the high slopes of the
Cairngorms.
The RSPB and the John Muir Trust failed to buy Glen Feshie, outbid by
the previously unknown Will Woodlands. But voluntary and statutory
bodies, professional management plans and amateur passions, all tapped
the new owners on the shoulders with suggestions as to its human use.
The sale of Glen Feshie has raised again a haunting question in
contemporary Scotland: what is wilderness for? What can our landscapes,
from douce tended gardens to dreich abandoned moors, teach us about
man's relationship to nature as the millennium approaches? Many would
argue that there is no such thing as wilderness anywhere in Scotland,
even in Glen Feshie. But by asking what wilderness is for, we may come
to understand what wilderness is, and recognise what we have in
Scotland.
Wilderness is after all a term we humans invented. Therefore there is
bound to be no agreed meaning of the word -- for scientists, wanderers,
historians, or any of the people of Scotland to whom their land belongs.
The search which began on the stony flats of the Feshie's flood plain,
a mile beyond the bothy at beautiful Ruaigh Aiteachan, the place of the
junipers, will lead in this column over the next weeks and months to
some reflection on the relationship between man and nature in Scotland.
Since the Rio summit concepts such as biodiversity, as a description of
the present, and sustainability, as a policy for the future, have become
part of our mind set.
This relationship we have with nature is deeper than recreation,
economics, or even ecology. Scotland is blessed by wealth, a complex and
beautiful natural history, and a well-educated population. It therefore
becomes almost an obligation for us to reflect on the relationship
between landscape, wildlife, and people. It is a philosophical necessity
for us to think about our ''right relationship to nature''.
During the next weeks and months I promise to wander off these points,
but I have good reason. The landscape of Scotland and its living cloak
invite distractions to the eye and mind. The eye and mind enrich each
other so that observation and thought can only exist symbiotically. And
then, I know far too little about a lot of things and a lot about far
too little. In this last hope I am typical of those to whom
professionals and pundits are responsible in the end.
I had with me in Glen Feshie the best of all guides and I will
ruthlessly use his wisdom and insight in my reflections and
perambulations. I only wish I had his fitness too, though he has been
dead for 81 years. Pace Duns Scotus, David Hume, and Robert Burns, he is
the greatest Scots philosopher of all and a man whose ideas are now
beginning to catch the imagination of the land of his birth.
His name is, of course, John Muir. Though the Trust, which in his
memory tried to buy the ''wild land'' of Glen Feshie, on this occasion
failed, his wiry, bearded figure gazed there at the waters of the
Feshie, as alive as you or me. When Ralph Waldo Emerson observed that
''there is in woods and waters a certain enticement and flattery,
together with a failure to yield a present satisfaction'', Muir wrote in
the margin: ''No -- always we find more than we expect''.
I was looking for wilderness and expecting only what I would find, as
I stood by the grey striated bole of a water-tumbled, long dead pine,
under a wide and silent, water-heavy sky. I had come up the east bank of
the river. I had climbed along the pink cascades of the falls at Badan
Mosach, where in the sunlight the water foams white into clear granite
pools among the pines. It had just rained and drops of the high tips of
the dark green needles shone tiny rainbows against a deep blue sky. Here
was Muir's best known saying, iridescent on every tree: ''When we
contemplate the world as one great dewdrop, striped and dotted with
continents and islands, flying through space with the other stars, all
singing and shining together as one, the whole universe appears as an
infinite storm of beauty''.
The rainstorm which blew up the wild gulch of Coire Garbhlach, sliced
out of the side of the Cairngorm plateau, was beautiful enough, if on
the wet side. Then the path took me through a dense plantation, where
the new clearfelling smelled of resin after the rain, and along a bend
in the Feshie reinforced with Gabion baskets: if even the rocks were
caged, the wilderness was not yet. Finally across the parkland of the
place of the junipers, sweet wet grass dotted with big Scots pines, came
the bothy, a little more comfortable every time, thanks to the Mountain
Bothies Association. Later, in the grey evening, I searched higher in
the glen and came to the stony point by the Feshie in spate.
At last it felt like wilderness. But was it?

THERE is a standing joke in Northern Ireland. Ask how Magherafelt when
she said Omagh. Answer is she was looking for Ballymoney or even
Moneymore. Maybe it is more of a sort of lying-down joke, but the one
thing you are never short of over there is jokes of some kind. I had not
visited the FAT LAD (Fermanagh, Armagh, Tyrone, Londonderry, Antrim and
Down) of the Six Counties for a long time and there was definitely an
air of levity about. Mind you, not only were some people enjoying the
cease-fire mightily but we were also trying to catch fish in the worst
possible conditions, the province of Ulster having been well fried this
summer.
We were based at the recently refurbished Lough Beg Coach Houses at
Ballyscullion House just outside Bellaghy near the banks of the Lower
Bann. The Bann drains Lough Neagh almost directly northwards, meeting
the sea on the north coast by way of Coleraine.
Now if you have never been in the area round Lough Neagh, you might be
forgiven for thinking you were in some part of Scotland. As the days
pass and familiarity grows, you realise that there is a beauty subtly
different from Scotland and you relax and allow it to wash over you.
Sure the crows and jackdaws crackle away the same as over here, but the
woods and yards they squabble over aren't.
Nor are the rivers and loughs. Well, there is very little in Europe
like Lough Neagh. Almost 150 square miles of rich, shallow water; a
veritable inland sea. Many rivers flow into it from the surrounding
counties, the Main, the Moyola, the Ballinderry among them and the lough
and rivers are home to a unique species of trout, the dollaghan. This
fish behaves much like a sea trout, living and feeding in Lough Neagh
and running into the rivers to spawn. They are also shy and best fished
for at night.
Over the years numbers have decreased drastically, usually because of
such things as ''improved'' drainage, and it is thanks to the dedication
of people like Alan Keys of the Balinderry River Enhancement Association
that numbers have improved in recent years. There are several distinct
populations of dollaghan in Lough Neagh, and Alan and his team try to
maintain the integrity of each strain in their restocking programme.
Nowadays, over a million fry are released into the rivers and the
dollaghan is making a comeback. We visited the hatchery at Oritor near
Cookstown on the Ballinderry River and left with the distinct impression
that the dollaghan's future is in good hands.
We also visited the famous eel fishery on the Bann at Portna. This is
a magnificent arrangement of wicker walls dividing the river and leading
it through about a dozen narrow channels which, when the eels are making
their downstream migration to the Sargasso Sea to breed, can take
prodigious numbers of fish.
We also fished for coarse fish where the Bann comes out of Lough Begg,
a shallow water above Lough Neagh and, despite the best efforts of the
noisy water-skiers, managed to catch some bright perch, classy roach and
decent bream. Go down river and you are into salmon water. At Carnoe, I
saw as many salmon as on a good day at the Junction on Tweed or lower
Tay at the back end. Below the weir, there is some classic fly water and
when that runs off, you are into deep, canal-like stretches where the
bait fishers come into their own. I watched some wonderful wormers and
peerless prawners take a decent number of strong fighting salmon, there
being few barriers between carnroe and the sea to tire the fish.
This is an area rich in fish of many species, and it is easily
accessible for the Scottish angler with a bit of imagination. Stranraer
to Larne and some decent self-catering accommodation and you could
easily have a few memorable fishing days. Given good conditions, you
might even be saying that it was because of the great catches of fish
that you knew how Magherafelt.

JACK JUGGLER AND THE EMPEROR'S WHORE By John Arden. Methuen, #16.99
IN the preface to his play The Workhouse Donkey, John Arden (author of
numerous other plays including Sergeant Musgrave's Dance) calls for
''the old essential attributes of Dionysus'', which include noise,
disorder, generosity, corruption, fertility, and ease. Jack Juggler and
the Emperor's Whore, the playwright's fourth novel, possesses some of
the Dionysian attributes. At almost 600 pages it is an ample fiction,
fertile with ideas, and highly inventive, the kind of work blurb-writers
describe as ''baroque'' and ''teeming''.
The ''Jack Juggler'' of the title is a powerful and successful theatre
director, Jack Pogmoor, of Barnsley origin, with a ''rattling Yorkshire
accent'' (teasingly, for Arden was born in Barnsley).
The novel explores a complex network of relationships, notably those
between Jack and Fidelio Carver, a playwright of left-wing principles.
''The Emperor's Whore'' of the novel's title is the name of a play, in
the production of which these characters are involved. Set in the
post-Revolutionary French society of Napoleon Bonaparte (''The First
Empire''), the play is intertwined with the lives of the characters (and
with other dramas) in infinitely complicated and suggestive ways. The
novel charts the rise and fall of Jack, the Director-Emperor, accused of
rape by various women and hardly a heroic figure; but his tale is woven
in with countless others.
Although impossible to summarise, this novel of epic proportions and
aspirations (suggested early on by biblical references) is, perhaps most
importantly, a fictional grappling with the theatre, its themes
recalling the late play of Shakespeare and in modern times the great
film Les Enfants du Paradis. It explores issues that have preoccupied
Arden: the relationships between directors, writers, actors, designers;
more broadly too, the interaction between life and art, and the
relationship of art and politics, including, importantly, sexual
politics.
It is an immensely literary -- indeed theatrical -- novel, with some
splendid passages of pastiche (of eighteenth-century writing), much wit
and wordplay, much self-referential humour. It is studded with
quotations from playwrights such as Webster and Jonson, and like their
work is full of violent death and intrigue; there are also all kinds of
sexual transgressions.
Arden's frame of reference is large and interesting; there is a
character, Sulaiman, of Muslim Indian background, and Leonore and
Fidelio are born of a marriage between a Viennese Jew and an English
vicar.
There is some hard-hitting satire about Britain over the past 30 years
or so, especially the North of Ireland; Arden himself is resident in the
Republic.
Reading this novel takes some commitment. There are some rather solid
slabs of prose, the discursiveness can weary, and the characters do not
emotionally engage.
Yet there are rewards. Arden once studied architecture in Edinburgh
and the evidence lies not only in his inclusion of Scottish characters.
The ambitious and ornate architecture of this fiction is impressive, its
labyrinthine complexity awe-inspiring: at times it is heavy, even
ponderous, but there are fine details, and sudden airy rooms, where
vaulted archways and windows offer glimpses of dazzling brightness.

Drawn from Nature, Keith Brockie, Arlequin Press Leather bound, #295
Cloth bound, #45
* KEITH Brockie is an industrious and accomplished artist. Born in
Haddington in 1955, his formative years were spent on a bicycle
exploring the Lothian coast, and particularly Aberlady Bay Nature
Reserve with its wildfowl and waders. His family's move to Fife when he
was 15 allowed him access to the Perthshire glens, and beyond.
Brockie studied art at Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art, gaining a
diploma in illustration and printmaking. After a short period working as
an illustrator with Dundee Museum he went freelance, specialising in
wildlife art.
My bookshelves show his prolific output, from his Wildlife Sketchbook
(1981) to Mountain Reflections (1993). In his newest publication, Keith
Brockie: Drawn from Nature, he reveals in his Introduction how his skill
and insight as a wildlife artist evolved from these boyhood forays, with
field notebooks full of species lists serving as his first sketchbooks.
Drawn from Nature is a collection of sketches and water-colours
completed not only in his native Scotland, but as far afield as
Greenland and Yemen. The usual sketching equipment he takes with him
comprises an eraser and a container with a range of graphite pencils
from H to 6B. He also lugs around a telescope mounted on a light-weight
tripod, so that he can study his subject close-up as he sits patiently
by the side of river, sea and desert.
But you need more than sharp pencils and an optical instrument. You
need an understanding and love of nature. Brockie captures the
inquisitive expression of the hyrax, a small desert mammal that is the
closest living relative of the elephant. In a colder climate he sketches
a white-billed diver in a Norwegian fjord.
Brockie can catch the harshness of nature with a few strokes: musk
oxen cooling off on a snow patch in Greenland; and in colour, ''detail
portrait from a sick male long-tailed duck in winter plumage which I
caught on the shoreline. It was thin but outwardly a perfect specimen
plumage-wise, they are really beautiful ducks. The initial drawing and
painting was done while he was contained in the sleeve of a jersey.''
Is the young Pacific seal from Oregon, USA, weeping over a lost love
in Brockie's face-on sketch? As he explains, the wet patches around the
eyes are tears from the lachrymal gland.
Spoonbill, chamois, the stilted legs of a crane, as Keith Brockie
says: ''The greatest joy of sketching is simply being part of and
enjoying the natural world.'' He shares this joy with us in this book.
Whichever edition you buy -- leather or cloth -- it will be treasured.

* STUART HOOD'S new novel -- The Book of Judith (Carcanet, #14.95) --
opens in Madrid. With a relic of St Theresa of Avila and the robe of the
Madonna of Pillar, his country's patron saint, beside him, Generalissimo
Francisco Franco is dying. His presence hovers over the city. A nun, who
has known his image all her life, has seen it beside the crucifix on
classroom walls, changes his sheets, adjusts the needles and catheters
that keep his body functioning while others decide when he will die.
Again, Hood features Fergus MacIver who is in Spain ostensibly to film
a documentary on the Peninsular War. He volunteered to act as a courier
to the clandestine Spanish left and insists on taking his research
assistant and lover, Judith Gordon, whose story this becomes.
We find Judith's life and thought process through her research notes,
where she compares her position with the camp followers in the
Peninsular War. Sixty to a battalion, a contemporary officer admires
their coolness before battle, feeling ''the sort of life they lead . . .
sadly unsexes them''. Hood is explicit; the role of women in MacIver's
political movement is no better.
Stuart Hood has not only brilliantly captured the atmosphere of trust
and paranoia that Judith and her comrades both created and maintained,
an atmosphere they appeared to accept without question, but has surely
reclaimed another piece of hidden political history.
The history may not be hidden, nor necessarily in need of reclamation,
but the difference between reality and illusion is the source of Duncan
Sprott's new novel, Our Lady of the Potatoes (Faber, #8.99, paperback
original).
Fourteen-year-old Marie-Louise Murphy is posing for the portrait which
will introduce her to King Louis XV. It is 1752 and Francois Boucher is
painting what became known as Reclining Girl in his Paris studio. He
stinks of sweat and his teeth are rotting. The smell of paint and
turpentine almost makes Marie-Louise sick and she often wishes she was
dead, lying naked with mosquito bites on her face and her body marked
from where her clothes were too tight.
This is the portrait Casanova claimed to have shown the king, having
made sure she washed and having paid for months to watch the child he
called O'Morphy undress.
She has the king's child and is married off to impoverished nobility,
but returns to Paris, one week dressed in gold and diamonds, the next in
sacking, her hair cut roughly, her face red and weather-beaten and her
accent hardened to save herself from the Paris mob.
Duncan Sprott brilliantly evokes Louis's court at Versailles. He
lovingly re-creates period details of dress and superstitions, food and
extravagance, showing the price of upward mobility and the cost of
compromise.
Small Holdings by Nicola Barker (Faber, #8.99, paperback original) is
about size and adjustment. She has a wonderful eye for eccentricities
and knows how to exploit their effect on others.
This is Phil's rites of passage and his movement from shyness to
society. Barker tends to tell rather than show us this evolution, but
it's done in a quirky voice that echoes conversation and is worth it for
the sly humour, found in such as the American self-help book which
advises punters to visit drugstores asking for extra-small condoms.

Chartbite presenter Mari Steven talks ANN DONALD through her reading
matters.
* I WALK around with my nose in a book, on the bus, the tube, or
walking up the road to work. I tend to jump about in my reading habits
as I've got quite a mixed collection of books. I'll go from modern
authors to a book of French poetry or a book of plays. A lot of that is
linked to the time I spent at the Arches Theatre Company. I bought The
Collected Tennessee Williams and enjoyed comparing his writing over the
different time scales. I enjoy reading plays because you can make up a
lot of the characters yourself.
I read Irvine Welsh's book Maribou Stork Nightmares recently and that
was excellent. I'm a fan of his and really like his style. I liked the
typographical games that denoted the different states of consciousness
of the main character in different situation.
I've also just read the whole Tales of the City saga by Armistead
Maupin. The books were originally written as weekly instalments in the
San Francisco Chronicle so you get a different character in each
chapter. I went to San Francisco and it was great walking around seeing
all the places they mentioned in the books.

A FRENCH KING AT HOLYROOD
A J Mackenzie-Stuart
John Donald, #10
BEFORE its latter-day role as a token royal residence, the Palace of
Holyroodhouse saw its share of courtly shenanigans. Most notably,
perhaps, it was the setting for some of the more dramatic moments in the
life of Mary Queen of Scots, including the despatch of Rizzio. Bonnie
Prince Charlie was sociable there in the heady days of the '45. And
another royal Charles lived in exile at the foot of the Canongate for
lengthy periods at the turn of the nineteenth century and then three
decades later.
He was Charles-Philippe, the Comte d'Artois, youngest brother of Marie
Antoinette's executed husband, Louis XVI, and later himself Charles X.
The Scottish sojourns of this rather dispiriting Bourbon are the subject
of A J Mackenzie-Stuart's little book.
Lord Mackenzie-Stuart -- first British Judge in the Court of Justice
of the European Communities and President of the Court from 1984 to 1988
-- brings a lawyer's thoroughness and curiosity to bear on the story of
the royal Frenchman and his court (or hangers-on) in Edinburgh.
Just as interesting as the life and times of the exiles, is the
incidental light shed on the Scottish capital, then undergoing the
transformation of New Town expansion.
As a young man Artois had ''every privilege and no obligations'',
sharing with his sister-in-law Marie Antoinette a passion for gambling.
Ironically, his first years at Holyrood were to see him under legal
constraints for debts incurred in equipping the emigre army.
Holyrood was no Versailles. No doubt the old palace benefited from the
social eclat of the gallic presence, even if the emigres had gargantuan
appetites and the locals' inadequate French led to all sorts of
conversational gaffes.
The most notable thing the Comte d'Artois seemed to have done at
Holyrood was be loyal to his mistress, Louise de Polastron.
One charming vignette describes Polastron's son attending dancing
classes in an Edinburgh close and lurking at the bottom of the stairs to
catch and kiss in turn the ''two score Scottish young ladies'' who were
his fellow pupils.
With a spell of unsuccessful kingship behind him in the Bourbon
restoration, Charles's second period of exile in Edinburgh, from 1830,
was even more low-key than the first. No 21-gun salute this time, though
the handsome furniture originally supplied by a local firm for his
apartments was reissued.
As Lord Mackenzie-Stuart points out, ''Whig policies had little room
for fallen monarchs''. Indeed the elderly Charles probably pre-empted
Talleyrand's plotting by taking himself off to Bohemia in 1832. He died
of cholera four years later.
With many more colourful episodes in its past, Holyrood's French
connection is a minor matter but Lord Mackenzie-Stuart's book will
appeal to those with an interest in the byways of Scottish history.

ABERDEEN yesterday revealed they had raised nearly #2.5m from the
recent share issue. News of the swelling of Aberdeen's coffers came on
the same day the club announced the #1m signing of Paul Bernard from
Oldham.
Even though the #3.5m share offer was undersubscribed, the club hailed
the capital-raising exercise a ''tremendous success.''
Aberdeen have switched from private to public company status and
attracted nearly 1700 new shareholders through the issue.
Chairman Ian Donald said that, once costs had been paid, most of the
money raised would be given to manager Roy Aitken to strengthen the
player pool.
He added: ''As we have stated in the past, Roy and his team are
constantly looking at players who may have a future at this club.
''That has not changed, except for the fact that he now has more cash
to invest.''
There had been a feeling before the share offer that Aberdeen had
pitched the issue price too low.
Some shareholders had reportedly been offered #30 for each of their
previous shares, which were split into 10 shares worth one-tenth of
their former value to facilitate the issue of the new shares at #1.75.
This issue price implied these old shares were worth only #17.50 each.

BOROUGHMUIR, less predictable than the weather and consistent only in
terms of their inconsistency, may hold the key to the Tennents
Premiership when they entertain Watsonians at Meggetland today, writes
Derek Douglas.
''It's all in the head,'' Boroughmuir coach Henry Edwards lamented
last weekend after his side had succumbed to Stirling County. The
observation prompted the notion that a sports psychologist might be a
worthwhile addition to the Meggetland back-room staff.
Nevertheless, Boroughmuir -- who have Bryan Easson back in the
playmaker slot of fly-half in place of Andy Knight and Iwan Tukalo
restored to the left wing -- have the wherewithal to topple Watsonians
from the premiership pole position which they share with Melrose.
The Borderers, meanwhile, have much the easier task today when they
take on Gala at Netherdale. Gala, like Hawick marooned at the foot of
Division I, appear to have settled their differences with Chris
Dalgleish, who was on the point of enlisting at the Greenyards, and for
them a victory on their own patch begins to come into the make-or-break
category.
Hawick, who are on duty at Raeburn Place against injury-weakened
Edinburgh Academicals, are in that category already.
The Greens, who have just a single win to show from five outings,
debut the 6ft 8ins Scotland Schools lock Andrew Barnes. The 18-year-old
son of Ian of that ilk appears because of injury to Derek Turnbull,
Alistair Imray moving to blind-side flank.
Stirling County, without the injured Kenny Logan, have listed a squad
for their Bridgehaugh game against Heriot's FP but it seems almost
certain that Murray Fraser, who had come back to Scotland from New
Zealand with the intention of making his way as a scrumhalf, will turn
out at centre in place of the injured Matt McGrandles.

Douglas Thompson talks to the baddest baddie in the movies and finds
out how he feels about the fact that he is now good news after years of
hell-rasing
DENNIS Hopper isn't evangelical about it but he recalls the moment the
other year when he considered reality might be a reasonable option. It
was after he had arrived on a Mexican film location, sampled an
LSD-laced glass of tequila, stripped naked, and ran amuck in the
mountains around Cuernavaca. The movie people found him the next day 20
miles away and in the custody of the rather bewildered local cops. The
moment of truth came a little later after two stunt men escorted him to
the next flight back to Los Angeles: that was when he tried to open the
emergency exit during take-off.
''What can I say?'' asks Hopper. ''I was a fun guy.''
Today in his cashmere jacket and Harrods brogues, full head of silver
hair and bizarre memories, the great emblematic figure of the sixties
is, at 60, a ''straight guy''. He moves carefully and is as relaxed as a
couple of packs of Marlboro a day allow -- they have replaced his
formerly average daily intake of half a gallon of rum, ''27 or so
beers'' and three grams of cocaine -- and says he hasn't even had an
aspirin in nine years. He hasn't lost his humour with his habits but
says: ''I'm happier. And busier.''
That's an understatement. Hopper is like the cavalry on the Hollywood
landscape; at present he seems to be in every other film. The charge
began almost a decade ago with David Lynch's already cult-established
Blue Velvet and Hoosiers with Gene Hackman.
Hopper, the nasty glint in the eye, the worrying curl of the lip, the
gnarling of the forehead was the celluloid devil, an omen that had no
intention of going away.
Now, he is being seen as the maniacal bad guy in the most expensive
film ever made, Kevin Costner's $200m Waterworld. Hopper, of course, is
far more interesting than Costner and his hula-hula girls and his
movies. This is a top-of-the-class, catch-me-if-you-can bad boy. Well,
former bad boy.
Hopper shrugs a little and pulls on another Marlboro as we talk near
the condominium he bought close to California's Venice Beach when he
returned from self-imposed New Mexico exile.
He says that he's simply glad to be working, but there is a
satisfaction about him presumably in the recognition, after all these
years. He is, after all, a legendary part of movie history -- he's
appeared in the major ''impact'' films since Rebel Without a Cause with
James Dean in 1955.
A year later he appeared again with Dean (as Rock Hudson and Elizabeth
Taylor's son) in Giant. He was 20 and under contract to Warner Brothers.
Three years later he was blackballed after a battle with director Henry
Hathaway (''I wouldn't take direction from anyone'') and out of the
movies and into New York theatre.
He married Margaret Sullivan's daughter Brooke ''Haywire'' Hayward,
reconciled with Hathaway who cast him (as a sullen kid) in the lavish
John Wayne ''shoot em up'' The Sons of Katie Elder.
But it was through his wife that he made his important connection --
her childhood friend Peter Fonda. They made 1969's Easy Rider which cost
$450,000, showcased Jack Nicholson, earned $40m (and is still earning on
TV, cable and cinema re-runs) and Hopper the status (he co-starred,
co-wrote, and directed the film) that success brings in Hollywood.
It was a brief affair.
He may have conjured an anarchic anthem of the sixties with Easy Rider
but when he was granted a free hand (and almost one million dollars) to
make another film the title, The Last Movie, was apt. The film made in a
remote Peruvian village won an award at the 1971 Venice (the Italian
one) Film Festival but disdain everywhere else.
His marriage to Hayward ended after eight years (a better achievement
than his union with Michelle ''Mamas and Papas'' Phillips which ran
eight days after their wedding at the top of a mountain in 1971: ''She
left me to live with Jack Nicholson and left Jack to live with Warren
Beatty'') and a third marriage to actress Daria Halprin also finished in
divorce. Victoria is his current wife.
Hopper stayed at his Taos ''retreat'' in New Mexico, emerging -- in
another ''impact'' film -- as the hopped-up war photographer, the
stoned-crazed character in Francis Coppola's Apocalypse Now in 1979.
At that time it wasn't certain if there were going to be any eighties
for him never mind working through them.
While Easy Rider was the ultimate drug-tripping pre-jelly biker movie,
Hopper didn't leave the action behind on the movie set. His life was
fuelled by booze and drugs.
''When we started using drugs in the sixties it was all wonderful fun
and games. We were all going to hold hands, take LSD, find God -- and
what happened? We ended up at the drug dealer's door and carrying guns
and in total madness.
''I didn't consider myself an alcoholic. I just drank all day long.
And drinking didn't interfere with my work. It interfered with my life.
''Finally, I just went totally mad and had what I call my 'Ray Milland
time' -- hearing voices, hallucinations. It was amazing because it
wasn't my liver, my kidneys and all that stuff that went. It was my
mind.
''That was the end of my drinking. I got myself into a detox clinic
and then I went to a halfway house. I stopped drinking when I came out
but I didn't stop using drugs. Cocaine, marijuana, whatever, but
basically cocaine. Staying on that sent me straight back into rehab. Now
I'm straight.''
He credits that with his resurgence as an actor. Of course, he was
never a bad actor -- just bad news. Now he's good bad news if you get
the idea, man. Hopper still talks in the Sixties idiom. It's a verbal
mannerism for him to say ''man'' in almost every sentence. He doesn't
notice. Hell, he doesn't care.
Hopper suffered self-inflicted, self-induced, self-destroying horrors.
He says he has not gone back to the American value system that he grew
up in but rather his own values -- and delight. ''I'm glad I'm here at
all. After all the stuff I went through I never thought I'd live to see
30.''
So, the 60-year-old rebel got the double. And he's using his time in
movies like Speed -- as the mad bomber who is somewhat bothersome in
Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves' lives -- and all the others to try and
resurrect the lost days.
Hopper is not regretful. Like his movie image he just rolls with the
moments. Astonishingly, he is not a Hollywood cynic.
In conversation his sentences are measured and mellow. He takes his
time to answer but he never seems to censor his thoughts.
He makes no apologies for the movies that kicked him back into the
Hollywood game. His films included The Texas Chainsaw Massacre II (he
was a crazy cop), River's Edge (he was a one-legged biker who lives with
a rubber sex doll called Ellie and gives marijuana to school kids), the
Warren Beatty-produced Pick-Up Artist (he was Molly Ringwald's
alcoholic, compulsive gambler father) and Black Widow (he played it
straight as a Texas toy manufacturer co-starring with Debra Winger and
Theresa Russell who has the ''mad'' role) and Hoosiers (again he's an
alcoholic father).
But Blue Velvet, a weird, wonderful mystery suspense film by
writer-director David Lynch is the film that made Hopper's nightmarish
cult mark on the eighties. ''I like it, I like it,'' says a grinning
Hopper of the film in which he creates Frank Booth, one of the cinema's
most chilling madmen.As Booth (who is turned on by snorts of helium he
keeps in a pocket tank and rock'n'roll especially Bobby Vinton's 1963
hit Blue Velvet) the critics hailed Hopper for the scariest performance
of his or anyone else's career.
Hopper (Vinton's Blue Velvet plays gently in the background on his
telephone answering machine) was assured of being the major presence in
another ''impact'' movie and one which would split audiences and
critics. Time magazine said the film would be ''reviled but demands
respect'' and called Hopper ''maybe the vilest sadistic creep in movie
history''.
The Los Angeles Times raved: ''The most brilliantly disturbing film
ever to have its roots in small town American life.'' Of Hopper's
psychotic creation they said: ''Obscene, sadistic, kinky, the most
terrifying evil ordinary man.''
Which, of course, was all music to Hopper. ''I wanted to be involved
as soon as I heard David Lynch's name. I loved Eraserhead and I thought
The Elephant Man was beautiful.''
Of his own classics, Rebel Without a Cause remains his most memorable
-- for tragic reasons. His co-stars Dean, Sal Mineo, Nick Adams, Natalie
Wood, all met sudden, early deaths. ''I can't explain any of that,''
says Hopper shaking his head. ''If people had been betting on who would
survive from that cast the odds would have been on me not making it. But
we all die, that's one thing we have in common. So, I don't have any
explanation for it.
''I never thought I would see 30. When I hit 40 I was shocked. I'm
probably going to live to be a very old man. Very angry. Very mean.
''When I was doing Apocalypse I wasn't allowed to come on set with
Brando. I'd do my scenes while listening on tapes to what he did. He
didn't want us to be on the set at the same time. I came on one night
and they said: ''This guy who used to be a baseball pitcher is going to
throw bananas at you because last night Brando called you a 'whimpering
dog'. So all night this guy's throwing bananas at me. I thought: 'Weird,
but that figures.' We never had a good relationship. Brando is more
creative than most actors and because of that maybe I give off something
that freaks him out. But I don't care about that anymore; those days are
gone. I've known him since I was 18. I admire him tremendously and I
don't think he enjoys people who admire him tremendously.''
Jack Nicholson wants to join Hopper and Peter Fonda in Biker's Heaven
which has just been retitled Easy Rider II. ''We are just a little away
from getting all the financing complete with a major studio,'' reveals a
happy Hopper.
But in Easy Rider everyone dies at the end.
''It,'' says Hopper, ''is a black comedy.''
He has an easy breeze and if Easy Rider II ever got made he knows it
would be a wake for lots of lives and memories. It will never happen.
But it is a bargaining point with the movie studios. Shit, that crazy
movie made money!
Hopper's madness has been established by his crazy characters and his
fans hound him like the Baskervilles. ''Some  of them remember The Texas
Chainsaw Massacre and come up to me and make buzz-saw noises and that
tends to throw me. Sometimes people do more than noises -- they pretend
to have the chain in their hands and bring it real close to my head.
''My career is strange, man.''

PRINCE Naseem Hamed may feel he is taking on a nation as well as WBO
featherweight champion Steve Robinson in his world title debut in
Cardiff tonight.
Welsh crowds have a history of lifting their sporting heroes to new
heights and, at the same time, are certain to give the 21-year-old
Sheffield showman the most hostile reception after his brash dismissal
of Robinson's chances of retaining the championship at his eighth
attempt.
Hamed believes it will be no contest. The 1-3 favourite said: ''The
crowd's no problem. But I will cause some friction as they will see
their hero destroyed by a flash young guy on the way up, destined to be
world champion.
''His strength is his tight defence, but only until someone breaks him
up and makes him drop his hands. Robinson will get stopped, and in
style. I reckon I'll do the business in four rounds.''
* GLASGOW lightweight Dave Anderson, who took four attempts to win the
ABA championship as an amateur, is confident he can snatch the British
professional title first time around when he takes on champion Michael
Ayres, from Ealing, at Basildon tonight.

The laid-back approach: Brian Barnes takes it easy between shots with
a portable chair (on doctor's orders) and a pipe (perhaps against
doctor's orders) yesterday at Sevenoaks during the London Masters
seniors tournament. The ploy, regrettably, did not work as he was forced
to pull out after 14 holes.

EDINBURGH has the task of continuing the encouraging trend of
entertaining and exciting Scottish games that have been delivered direct
to the armchairs of the masses this season when the first derby of the
season between Hibs and Hearts goes on live tomorrow at Easter Road.
There was a time recently when the outcome would have been easy to
predict, in that Hibs would not win, but that long run has been well and
truly ended with three successes last season.
Even easier to forecast was that it would be ferocious, dreary, and
ultimately unsatisfactory, but perhaps the great new deal we all seek
will stretch as far as the capital collision this time.
Hibs are favourites, rightly so, after a bright, promising start to
the new season, during which they have not lost a game and, maybe most
encouraging of all, beat Rangers at Ibrox last week.
Hearts, on the other hand, have managed only one league win under new
manager Jim Jefferies, who took his men away for a two-day break in
England this week to focus minds on the task in hand.
Hibs' captain Gordon Hunter, who missed the Ibrox success because of a
hamstring injury, is ready to return, but is not sure he will be picked.
''I have done a lot of work this week and should be fit to play if the
manager can be persuaded to change a winning side.''
Hearts left defender Neil Berry behind for treatment in the hope that
he would be ready for consideration, but that will not be decided until
nearer kick-off time.
It is likely that Gary Mackay, a veteran of many a derby and
successful in the great majority, will be back in the midfield, but
Scott Leitch is suspended after having been sent off against Celtic.
Said Jefferies: ''There is a lot of pride at stake for us after our
recent form, but this is a chance to get back on the rails.''

DEAR Brian,
I am told by some friends that you have been letting off steam in an
English paper about us Scotchmen as ''animals,'' and about how you don't
rate me and John Jeffrey in particular. JJ you accuse of mumbling and
spending too much time offside -- how very damaging -- and I'm just very
ordinary, but you say how you like Finlay Calder.
I also note that you have been taking counsel from some very average,
but arrogant, English and Welsh journalists. Most of them could bore for
Europe if ever there was a competition of that kind, I can tell you.
They say that I don't ''fork much lightning,'' but what I said, which
only mirrored what most of us thought of your post-match comments at
Twickenham last year, appears to have barbed your botty anyway.
Fin tells me that you are highly intelligent, and that you know your
rugby inside out. He says that the word intense hardly describes you. JJ
says that you are a very, very odd bloke indeed, but he remembers that
when you were on the Lions' tour with him he was glad that you were on
his side.
What you fail to see in all of our chat north of the Border is that,
beneath it all, why we are so jumpy about you saying some of the crazy
things that you do is because we admire you as a player. Comparing you
to all the other English rugby players we, your poor little country
cousins north of Carlisle, see in you something that is distinctly
un-English. You are, at your best, the consummate hooker. You are the
kind of player that any international team would be intensely proud to
have in its side.
What we don't understand is why you let yourself down so badly after
games with such inane comments. Rugby, though, has a duty, and that duty
falls on the players to keep the game in good regard. Not to let it
down.
But Brian, oh Brian, you have a short memory. When David Sole's boys
beat you that day in 1990 it was Finlay Calder who put his arms around
you as you broke into tears on Murrayfield's turf after the final
whistle. When England weren't good enough to beat Scotland at Twickenham
earlier this year, the reason you were interviewed on TV within seconds
of the end of the match was because it was you who ran from the pitch
without shaking hands. I didn't think that was right.
The reason JJ went apoplectic when you said that the Scots had done
nothing but try to ruin the game was that you were wrong.
It had nothing to do with the absence of political correctness in your
statements at all, my friend. I defy you to look through the video again
and ignore all the ruined possession from both sides.
But now I have got to thinking, and I remember. Aha, that's it, you've
got a book coming out! In it you must have a blockbuster chapter about
the Scots and about how much you hate them, and in a country like
England that should help it to sell well, and, perversely, it will be
just as successful north of the Border.
No doubt you'll have a blockbuster chapter on money, and another on
the English set-up, and another on your view of the world scene. Now I
get it. Good on you pal, get in there, make as much as you can. You have
a dreadful image, which is probably a very good image for selling a
book.
You know, I can't live like this. Sorry friend, but I can't pretend,
even on my worst day, to dislike someone forever that I don't dislike at
all. There you are.
If you can't accept that then fine.If we ever meet and you turn your
back then fine. But let me assure you that I hope you sell lots of
copies of your book. Just remember . . . you started it. Yours etc.

CELTIC manager Tommy Burns yesterday made the strongest plea yet for
Scottish football to join England in accepting television evidence, both
for clearing innocent parties and identifying miscreants the referee has
missed.
Although Burns' remarks have been prompted by what appears to be an
unjust sentence on one of his own players, Peter Grant, he made it clear
that it was not simply a case of pleading on behalf of this single case.
''I feel that managers and the players' union should get together and
put a case forward for bringing this country into line with England on
this matter,'' he said. ''Too often things have been clouded, innocent
parties have suffered. It is time for TV evidence to be taken into
account.
''In England referees have come out and admitted they made a mistake,
just like anybody else, and this is not a criticism of anyone in
particular, only a criticism of the failure to take into account
television evidence.''
Celtic have written to the SFA along these lines after Grant was
automatically suspended from today's Old Firm league game at Parkhead
because he was sent off by referee Bobby Orr during last week's win at
Tyencastle.
Grant, who was considered to have been guilty of violent conduct by
the referee after his clash with John Robertson, had been spotted by the
stand-side linesman, vehemently protested his innocence, backed by
Robertson, and the Scottish Television pictures appeared to prove him
correct.
The Celtic man is now only one disciplinary point away from a further
three-game suspension and it is the club's argument that he is being
severely punished for a ''crime'' he did not commit.
''The other side of the coin is true as well,'' said Burns, ''and if
players were caught on camera doing wrong when the referee hadn't seen
them, they would have to take the punishment and live with it.''
Before he went on to discuss the business in hand, the first league
game of the season between the Old Firm, the manager also dismissed the
latest speculation about John Collins by saying that he was in the squad
and would be considered for the game. It may be that Collins, who has
been left out of the last two matches, will appear alongside Paul McStay
and the fit-aain Phil O'Donnell.
Celtic, meanwhile, will have a close look at Dutch international
defender Gerry Deyon when he comes over for a week's trial, beginning
today in the reserve team at Ibrox. The former PSV Eindhoven man bought
out his contract with Cannes and is keen to further his career in
Britain.
Rangers will bring back Alan McLaren, who missed the 2-2 draw with
Borussia Dortmund in midweek because of suspension, but will check on
Gordon Durie.
Manager Walter Smith believes that, even if it is early season yet, it
would not be a good idea, from the Ibrox viewpoint, to see Celtic go any
further ahead in the table. ''I thought before the season began that
Celtic would be better prepared for a challenge, but I also believe that
the league needs to settle down before anything is clear.''
It will be a special day for Ian Durrant if he is chosen, as it would
be his 300th game for Rangers.
Firhill will be a place for the curious as Partick Thistle welcome
their long time manager John Lambie into the away dug-out for the first
time this season. Falkirk are now Lambie's responsibility.
Murdo MacLeod, the new man in the Thistle manager's seat, will have no
such problems, and so far has had the better of the switchabout which
brought him from Dumbarton as successor to Lambie. His team have a
four-point lead on Falkirk already and if they maintain it or extend it,
as he will be demanding, it will be a cheery Jags support who wave
farewell to the former gaffer who kept Thistle in the premier division
for three successive seasons.
There will be no time for reminiscing today, however, as Falkirk seek
their first win of the season. ''I am concentrating on Falkirk now, and
we need a victory.''
He could have Colin McDonald back after injury, but doubtful are Joe
McLaughlin and John Clark.
Aberdeen's new boy, #1m midfield man Paul Bernard, signed from Oldham,
put on a brave face as he looked forward to his new career at Pittodrie,
starting against Raith Rovers. The Under-21 internationalist revealed
that his transfer had been overshadowed by the news that his father was
terminally ill.
Rovers manager Jimmy Nicholl will bring in Davie Kirkwood at right
back for Stephen McAnespie, and has promised that part of the #900,000
from his sale to Bolton will be used to bolster the squad.
Kilmarnock, still searching for their first point, will have Steve
Maskrey and Billy Findlay available for their visit to Motherwell.

THE stars were out in force at Forthbank Stadium on Tuesday, when
Stirling County played the Barbarians. Unfortunately for me, most of
them were birlin' around my head!
I was poleaxed by the Bristol lock, Simon Shaw, who was indulging in a
spot of head-hunting. What a clatter. I went down for an eight-count.
Once my vision had cleared and the stars had settled, I was as right
as rain, but it was a sore one.
Later, at the dinner which raised #18,000 for the Princes Royal's
Carers' Trust, Simon told me that I had taken the mickey out of him by
running past him once and that he wasn't going to let it happen again.
It's no big deal. These things happen, but I suppose it's unlikely
that anyone will hand Simon a dose of his own medicine. He's nearly 6ft
10in and 18-stone with it. You'd need a step-ladder to get within
striking distance of his head.
The game itself was a great success. I think we acquitted ourselves
well against a useful Barbarians side and the large crowd was treated to
a 14-try bonanza. Personally, though, the legacy of the game is that I'm
out for 10 days or so and will miss our match against Heriot's today.
I picked up a bad stave on a finger and it's swollen up like a
balloon. My left knee has also assumed balloon-like proportions. Yes, I
hear what you're saying. Now it's official: Logan's a balloon.
Better a balloon, though, than the ''unsuitable boyfriend'' tag which
Jack McLean labelled me with in this newspaper yesterday. Does anybody
have the wee bauchle's address?
The injuries mean that I'm sidelined until our game against Melrose
next weekend. I was supposed, too, to play for the Barbarians against
Newport on Tuesday. However, Bridgehaugh will still be well represented
by Kevin McKenzie and Ian Jardine.
One aspect of Tuesday's game which really appealed to me was the
playing surface at Stirling Albion's Forthbank Stadium. After the game
the Baa-Baa's captain Gavin Hastings was saying that he much preferred
playing on the short grass that you get on football pitches. I couldn't
agree more.
Some of the club pitches that we play on week in and week out look
like they're ready for mowing.
Trust me, I'm a farmer. I could get a decent load of hay from most of
the club pitches in Scotland.
That was the first time that I've played on a football pitch and, with
the exception of Murrayfield, it's the best surface that I've played on
in Scotland.
If it's fast, open rugby that we all want to see, then I have some
advice for groundsmen up and down the land. Get out the mowers, lads,
set the blades really low and you'll be amazed at the difference it
makes to the standard of play.
And finally, I've been out doing more missionary work in Glasgow. The
venue this time was Bearsden Academy.
Yes, the school which Brian MacKinnon/Brandon Lee enjoyed so much that
he/they tried it twice.
The coaching session attracted a healthy degree of interest. The boys
ranged in age from 12 to 32, a state of affairs to which my attention
was drawn only when their wee scrum half rushed off at half-time to hand
over the family allowance to a female with a pram who was standing on
the touchline.

The Herald's regular reviewers listen to the best sounds around
(What's The Story) Morning Glory, Oasis (Creation)
* IN common with every other two-bit social commentator, I have my own
arch posture to adopt, my own abstruse theory to propound vis a vis the
ongoing Blur-Oasis debate. It is my philosophical contention that Blur
can be held analogous to Harriet Harman; Oliver Hardy; Frankie Howerd;
Oliver Cromwell's Roundheads, and the Vauxhall Cavalier. In symbiotic
contrast, Oasis are plainly Norman Wisdom; Francoise Hardy; Tommy
Sheridan's mum; Charles II's royalist cavaliers, and a 1980 Mk1 Golf GTi
(with sunroof). Or was it the other way around? Ach, stuff it. What's
the new Oasis album like? Initially, it's a grave disappointment. Why?
Because unlike Blur's current corker, The Great Escape, with its
multiplicity of personas, its satirical insights and its acute
observations, Morning Glory isn't about anything. Other than being about
being a member of a joyous adolescent bedroom-band. Which is just about
enough. Morning Glory is thus best understood as a series of sardonic
nods of Noel Gallagher's head: to John Lennon, Gary Glitter, the Glitter
Band, Status Quo, Sgt Pepper. At the same time it's the sound of a bunch
of blokes who aren't teenagers anymore monkeying around, very loud, and
trying to go all teenage Zen-mystic again with lyrics like: ''As he
faced the sun, he cast no shadow.'' So it's not all that it might be,
but it's a little bit better than all right. All right?
Peel Slowly And See, the Velvet Underground (Polydor)
* A BOXED five-CD set with a peelable banana on the cover, just like
Andy Warhol designed it way back when in 1967. Unlike way back when in
'67, however, the Velvet Underground in '95 comes garlanded with
critical superlatives, plus a neat 88-page booklet. So in addition to
the four albums the band recorded in their lifetime, this set also gives
you 25 hitherto unreleased recordings; to wit, 12 demos recorded at
various times between 1965 and 1969, along with seven out-takes from the
Loaded sessions and six live performances, including one from the very
end in 1970. But does purchase of this sumptuous boxed-set indicate that
the purchaser has succumbed to Terminal Yuppie CD-Completism Syndrome?
Probably. But take heart: the wider world needs increased exposure to a
music of such blank-eyed, delicate, fragrant evil that it still makes
the worst type of devil-fearing Christian run screaming for cover.
Soma City, Kevin Salem (Roadrunner)
* I HAVE been bleating piteously about Dumptruck's whereabouts for the
past seven years, ever since the Boston quartet vanished after two
gorgeous albums. Well here they are, or one of them at least. Ex-truckie
Kevin Salem offers an intelligent, gutsy, melodic rock'n'roll stew. Lap
it up now, and hope for a swift answer to my sole remaining Dumptruck
question: where is their chief songwriter, Seth Tiven?

I Am An Indian, Clusone Trio (Gramavision)
* THE Amsterdam-based Clusone Trio's live performances can be
extremely theatrical, as this CD -- even without the visuals --
confirms. Banshee wails and flying cymbals punctuate a repertoire
comprising faithful (well, almost) Ellington tunes, fierce cello riffing
and quirky saxophone salutes to Irving Berlin. Mad and dangerous to
know, yes, but too expertly done to be bad.
Matka Joanna, Tomasz Stanko Quartet (ECM)
* POLISH trumpeter Stanko's first major label album in 20 years takes
its name from a 1961 film which, not being an expert on Polish cinema,
must be a darkly mysterious piece indeed. Stanko's playing blends free
expression with economy and his compositions unfold with an unhurried
grace, helped in no small measure by the contributions of pianist Bobo
Stenson, bassist Anders Jormin and drummer Tony Oxley.

IT is a long established fact that jazz aficionados in Europe are
appreciative and their counterparts on the other side of the Atlantic
come here on tour to find their work is better known than it is in their
home land.
But, while there is that understanding, and a genuine regard for the
music and the musicians, there is also a down side.
Almost always our knowledge of jazz has arrived through recordings,
and unfortunately, this can offer a distorted view of the real history
of the music.
A case in point is the adulation received by Red Nichols in this
country and in the early thirties, and then the critical rejection he
suffered when the recordings of Louis Armstrong and Bix Beiderbecke
reached the shores.
Now a new book is scheduled for publication later this year which may
put Nichols's work into proper prospective.
As far as I am concerned, Nichols is neither the golden boy of the
Jazz Age he was made out to be in that first flush of hero worship, nor
the charlatan who chased commercial success above everything.
The truth lies somewhere in between and the book which has been
painstakingly put together by Philip Evans, who was one of the
collaborators on the definitive Bix Beiderbecke biography, will perhaps
show that.
In those heady earlier days when the records by Nichols were being
issued here under the various pseudonyms he and his cadre of New York
based musicians used, Nichols cornet was seen as the real voice of jazz.
Musicians themselves, from that era, will tell you how the man from Utah
was rated as the number one on his instrument ahead of Armstrong. And
ahead of Beiderbecke as well.
That happened because no one had yet heard the best work of the two
others, which is why Nichols then suffered his mauling at the hands of
the critics and the fans.
They all seemed determined to wipe away their own mistakes by
vilifying Nichols and so his reputation foundered.
Accusations of commercialism were hurled at him and even fellow jazz
musicians -- especially that group of Chicagoans who clustered around
Eddie Condon -- mocked his music.
Now, listening to some of that music he made over the decades he
recorded you find much that is admirable. His Five Pennies groups
allowed Benny Goodman, among others, to blossom as a hot player.
While Nichols' own work may still sound effete compared to Louis or
Bix, the rest of the musicians are superb. Nichols did have a way of
picking the very best men around to play in his various groups. For
example when the George Gershwin musical Girl Crazy opened in New York
in 1930 with the composer conducting, Nichols's pit band included Jack
Teagarden, Glen Miller, Goodman, and Gene Krupa.
These men were also at the core of many of his recording bands along
with the Dorsey brothers, Tommy and Jimmy, and the pioneer trombonist
Miff Mole.
Nichols died in Las Vegas 30 years ago, some six years after Danny
Kaye had played him on screen in The Five Pennies -- a film which like
most jazz bio-pics had even less historical accuracy than Braveheart.
Over the years his work had remained smooth, polished, melodic, and
urbane. and until the end that knack of choosing some of the best
musicians around never deserted him. Hence, in the fifties, he would be
found with the booming joyous bass sax of Joe Rushton, so reminiscent of
Adrian Rollini roaring out of either small or augmented Five Pennies
groups.
Early in his career he had worked with Paul Whiteman and would recall
in later life: ''My chair in the Whiteman orchestra was taken by Bix and
that's still the greatest honour I've ever received.''
The book, if it can even partially restore his reputation, may yet
match that honour for the man who epitimised New York jazz in the
twenties and early thirties and then fell into unjustified neglect
because too many people praised him too highly.

THE Scottish Rugby Union and national squad representatives will meet
on Wednesday night for the first hard negotiating session aimed at
placing the players under contract before the first international of the
season, against Western Samoa on November 18.
The International Rugby Football Board, which has been meeting in
Tokyo for the past week to ratify the Paris Declaration which scrapped
the amateurism regulations, will wrap up its deliberations today, and
will stage a news conference at the offices of the Japan Rugby Football
Union tomorrow morning.
Scotland's two IB representatives, Fred McLeod and Allan Hosie, are
expected home on Monday and, provisionally, McLeod is scheduled to hold
a media briefing at Murrayfield later that day.
The game has been in a state of limbo since the historic meeting of
the IB in Paris five weeks ago. The SRU, like other domestic
administrations, has been unable to flesh out the new professionalism
regulations until this weekend's ratification meeting in Japan.
By next week, and despite the fact that the SRU still has to stage an
extraordinary general meeting at which a new constitution will require
to be put in place, McLeod and other Union negotiators will have a
clearer idea of what lies ahead.
Nevertheless, if the SRU is to meet its own timetable of issuing
contracts to international players before the Western Samoan Test match,
then time will be of the essence and the legal minefield represented by
the contractual negotiations will have to be surmounted with a light
touch.
The principle hurdle which has to be crossed lies in the relationship
between the international players, their clubs, and their districts. If
any club decides to place its players under contract then this could be
at variance with whatever is decided at national level.
Even more problematical could be the relationship between the district
sides and the clubs. If, as currently seems likely, the director of
rugby, Jim Telfer, has his way and the district sides become the focus
for more serious rugby -- not least in a European context -- then this
is one area in which the more ambitious clubs are destined for a
showdown with officialdom.
This very point is currently the subject of a series of working party
sessions being held in the districts but, like so much else, including
player-payment at club and district level, transfer fees, win-bonuses
and just how much national squad players will receive from the SRU, the
discussions have been tantamount to a game of blind man's bluff.
When McLeod and Hosie return from Tokyo, the serious negotiations will
begin.
* AUSTRALIAN coach Bob Dwyer, who was at the helm when the Wallabies
became world champions in 1991, looks likely to be removed from his post
after officials in his home state decided he was no longer the best man
for the job.
Dwyer, who will contest the coaching job in October after a record 10
years at the helm of Australian rugby, has lost the support of his own
New South Wales Rugby Union according to NSW RU president Peter Crittle.
The NSW RU instead will vote on October 6 for state-team coach Greg
Smith, Crittle said yesterday, describing the Wallabies' recent track
record as ''very disappointing.''
And he added: ''The fact is that Smith, albeit in a much shorter
career, has never lost an international match.''
Smith's New South Wales team beat New Zealand and South Africa in 1993
and Ireland last year. It has also been dominant over main domestic
rivals Queensland in their last few matches.
* THE Rugby Football Union will not be taking any action following
Brian Moore's call for Will Carling to be replaced as England captain.
Moore's autobiography, published next week states: ''I do not believe
he should lead England again purely because it is time for a change.''
Yesterday, RFU secretary Tony Hallett, said: ''It is union policy not
to get involved in players commenting about each other. When contracts
become a way of life for England squad players under the new open rugby,
there will be a clause relating to bringing the game into disrepute --
not that I am suggesting that Moore's remarks come into this category in
any way.
''The fact that there will need to be some control on what players
write and say in the future is one other reason why in the current
climate we do not want to get involved now,'' he added.

It's Renaissance Night at The Tunnel and the clubbers are ou tin
force. Stephen Ferguson goes along to sample a heavenly atmosphere.
ONCE a month, a flock of angels decide to quit the heavens and spend
the night in Glasgow. The reason lies on the other side of a large
wooden door, its surface jutted with horns, and down a dark flight of
twisting stairs to where music leaks from a source at the end of a
corridor.
Through an entranceway and into the heart of the sound is the main
room of The Tunnel nightclub. The angels are evident not only as icons
within the decor -- alongside cupids and artificial white clouds that
have a ceiling for a sky -- but, somehow, within the music itself; in
the rhythms that shake up the mind and dust down the soul, and in the
rising plains of hot sound that give birth to an expectant surge in the
chest and the throat.
Angels, it seems, know a good thing when they hear it.
After all, this is as close as the contemporary club-scene gets to the
divine.
It's Renaissance night at The Tunnel -- the dance event that happens
once a month, when the Newcastle-based Renaissance promoters take up
residency, and 1200 people congregate to let the emboldening experience
filter into every pore.
The theme of rebirth extends through more than just the name of the
visiting club and their use of renaissance motifs.
Renaissance itself has been credited with helping to bring about a
rebirth in nightclubbing direction and popularity during the past few
years, and The Tunnel, after recently being named UK Discotheque of The
Year by BEDA (the British Entertainment and Discotheque Association), is
leading a renaissance in credibility for the Scottish club scene -- a
belief echoed by the judges as one of their reasons for making the
award.
In recent times, Glasgow's clubland reputation has been dogged by the
city's hard-man image dying hard, and by the imposition of the
late-night curfew to stop clubbers migrating between venues.
The club scene has always been a cyclical beast, turning over one
fashion and form after another. So what does The Tunnel nightclub have
planned to ensure not only growth for itself -- thereby further
improving the city's clubland reputation -- but to ensure that their
clientele stay entertained and attentive?
One important bond set to be strengthened is the Tunnel/Renaissance
relationship.
''We're really pleased with the way the shows have been going at The
Tunnel,'' said Mark Wheaton, co-promoter with Renaissance. ''The quality
of the people going to the gigs has been refreshing, and the club is a
beautiful environment in which to do a Renaissance party. We're looking
to form a long-term relationship. We're already booked to stage a
monthly event in the club until May of 1996.''
The Renaissance stable of house DJs are much sought-after and include
some of the finest talent around: John Digweed, Keoki from New York,
Radio 1 DJ Danny Rampling, Italy's Fathers Of Sound and Ian Ossia. All
of them have performed at The Tunnel in recent Renaissance visits.
''Wanted: a castle by a loch. Function: to be used as a nightclub
venue.''
That could be the advertisement wording if the Tunnel/Renaissance plan
to hold a one-off club night in a Scottish Stately Home works out. In
May of this year Renaissance planned to start a five-venue tour of
English Stately Homes but plans fell through because of licensing
problems and adverse rumours spread by rival promoters.
Now, Renaissance feels that it is getting the knack of the complicated
licensing and PR game they have to play, and everything has been
formally secured to stage the first English date. All going well down
south, a similar one-off event in Scotland is a definite plan for the
future.
But club-life goes on outside of the relationship with Renaissance.
The Tunnel's resident DJs are not currently national, let alone
international, names on the club scene. But that could all change, and
the club's reputation be further enhanced, by the planned release of a
triple CD collection of mixes through Network Records.
The first CD will be a special set by Paul Oakenfold, the grand-daddy
of the modern mixing method, the second will feature resident Friday
night DJ, Michael Kilkie, and the third will highlight the Saturday
night sounds as mixed by Colin Tevendale and Steven McCreery.
Nightclubs are now a huge business in themselves -- real evidence of
this can be seen in the way nightclubs are spreading into other areas.
The Ministry Of Sound in London is installing a video games area and
building a cinema within its complex, and The Hacienda in Manchester now
has a bar officially affiliated to the nightclub.
This development is one that The Tunnel is keen to emulate. To have a
bar open during conventional hours that could act as a pre-club venue
would no doubt be used by those happy to be associated with the club,
and happy to be in the company of others who frequent it also.
As The Tunnel approaches its fifth birthday later this year, its
history paints it as originally a couture-conscious club, where the
music was of secondary importance to the designer visibility of its
patrons, and where management attitudes retained some of the slipshod
practices that the old style of ''disco'' could get away with.
''In the beginning the club played a greater cross-section of music.
Now, at the weekend it's house music with a greater cross-section of
people,'' said Brian Reid.
Reid managed The Tunnel for three years, until a recent promotion
within the Big Beat organisation that owns the nightclub, and has been
instrumental in putting the club into its current enviable position.
''The whole business has become more complicated. Now even one
advertising flyer has to be arranged months in advance -- now you have
to think about contracts and the club's direction, and the direction of
house music and what up-and-coming DJs the club should book in
advance.''
But for all its growing complexities, the club's clear eye on the
future of clubland should ensure that this is a rebirth where the angels
-- both of Renaissance and of its dressed-up, danced-up clientele --
keep flying back for more, into a tunnel with a pretty strong light at
the end of it.

The Missing, Andrew O'Hagan, Picador, #14.99
MISPERS is the Metropolitan Police term for missing people. Mispers
sounds like Caspers, but the reality is closer still. They are ghosts.
Those who are now dead haunt the lives of those who do not yet know.
Those who are lost yet alive walk among us, sit across from us in train
carriages but remain separate. The cutting of all family ties means they
can float. The tag of the missing is not on the toe, like the dead. It
is an invisible white sheet, not a shroud but more than a barrier.
Andrew O'Hagan first sensed the brush of that invisible white sheet
when as a little boy he found the picture of his grandfather wedged
behind the boiler. It was out of sight, but never out of his mother's
mind which would chew on the image of her father, lost in the Atlantic
during the Second World War, missing presumed dead. The shadow returned
to his childhood in Irvine during the long hot summer of 1976.
A little boy, three-year-old Sandy Davidson, went missing. Never
found, he led a young O'Hagan to brood: ''What if someone had taken
Sandy away in a van?'' It is a chilling image said with childlike
simplicity, and a key to the success of O'Hagan's remarkable book. In
itself the image of a small boy with a grown-up, in a van, is not
distressing; what is unsaid, unknown, is unspeakable. That is why it is
truly disturbing.
O'Hagan's The Missing is the literary antidote to the poison of
true-crime mags and serial-killer biographies which pander to the
public's twisted thirst for violence. Part of the book deals extensively
with two Glasgow girls who disappeared, murdered by the serial-killer
Fred West. It may well be the only record of their short, tragic lives.
The victim, even in death, has an importance.
They are prosecution witnesses at society's trial for neglect,
negligence, a lack of care or sometimes even thought. In one case
documented in the book a teenage boy disappears. Five years later a
women speaks to his mother at the bingo; she says she saw the boy being
led away by two men. Her husband had told her not to get involved. The
husband was now dead.
Of the victims whose remains were found at 25 Cromwell Street, O'Hagan
writes: ''That 12 young women could have gone missing, many so close to
their homes, so much in the open, and that they went undiscovered for so
long, was one sort of bad news. That many of them were unmissed --
unlooked for in any sense -- was getting close to the worst sort of news
possible.''
Fred West drove a Mr Whippy van through the streets of Glasgow during
the summer of 1963. He moved up to his new bride's home town. Catherine
Costello, who everyone called Rena, met Fred in Gloucester, where she
moved after falling pregnant. Born in Coatbridge, her early married life
was at 25 Savoy Street, Bridgeton. Charmaine, her first child, was
followed by a second, Anne Marie.
Rena met Anne McFall -- the girl who would share her shallow grave for
more than 20 years -- in the Victoria Cafe, Scotland Street, with her
friend Isa. Isa eventually moved into Fred and Rena's new flat in
McLellan Street, Kinning Park, as a nannie.
A violent husband, Fred slashed John McLachlan's stomach when he
caught him with Rena. Despite such abusive treatment of her friend, Anne
McFall fell in love with West and moved down to Gloucester with Isa,
Rena, and the kids. It was a hellish experience.
Rena's beatings continued. Eventually Isa phoned John McLachlan,
begging him to collect them all in secret, but Anne cracked. Fred was
furious and refused to release the children. Anne stayed while Isa,
Rena, and John fled. Months later Rena returned to see her children.
The remains of Anne McFall, Rena Costello, and little Charmaine were
buried in Letterbox field at Much Marcle before the end of 1970. No-one
reported them missing. Rena wasn't close to her family and Anne's mother
died of malnutrition in 1969. John McLachlan recognised their pictures
on the news in 1995. He still lives in Milton.
Children run through this book like malicious sprites, throwing rocks
at the author, or bombing round on bikes shouting about Rosemary West.
O'Hagan's own childhood violence -- he would bully and beat other
smaller children -- is used to illustrate the capacity we can all have
for foul acts. Some, it seems, simply never grow up.
This is a strong, emotive, moral book. At times too personal and
slightly self-indulgent, it is however necessary and very important.
Words hold up the blurred faces of missing boys, girls, men, and women.
The missing have an everyday ordinariness which allows us to think we
can help. And we can. Concern for others, a chat over problems,
prevention rather than cure.
Andrew O'Hagan has shone a light through the thin white sheet,
illuminating tens of thousands of forms. Today everyone knows someone
who is missing. It is tragic, but true.

THE STATEMENT by Brian Moore. Bloomsbury, #14.99
BRIAN Moore is a distinguished novelist who in recent years has taken
to writing very superior thrillers. Maybe thrillers is the wrong
designation, for novels such as Lies of Silence and The Colour of Blood
explore profound themes with perception and compassion. But these books,
and this one, are short, they have sustained narrative impetus and they
are written in a cool limpid prose that is consummately readable. And
they deal with political violence.
So the term thriller is probably appropriate enough, as long as it is
understood that these are very literary and -- depite the sheer pace of
the storytelling -- very subtle books. In a way Moore lets you have your
cake and eat it: he gives you a superb, effortless read; at the same
time he gives you something to think about.
In The Statement Moore has surpassed himself. Once again the book has
all the charge and tension of the best thrillers; once again there is a
profundity that transcends the thriller genre. In The Statement Moore
manages to say more about the recent history of France, and the current
condition of the Catholic Church in France, than more pretentious and
portentous novelists would manage in books of five times the length.
The story is that of Pierre Brossard, an evil man who committed
heinous wartime crimes. His friends and protectors in church and state
are turning against him; he is being hunted, partly by the agencies who
used to protect him, and partly by an avenging Jewish Commando. But it
soon becomes clear that this Commando is not what it seems; that is just
one of the many twists Moore has in store.
The true merit of this novel does not lie in the turns of the plot,
brilliantly handled as these are; rather it lies in Moore's ability to
present the plight of a wicked, if resilient, old fugitive as someone at
once symbolic and deserving of compassion.
And Moore also has deep things to say about a country wracked by its
recent past. France is currently asserting itself on the world stage; as
Moore suggests, this is a country that cannot be at ease with its recent
past, and that truth might explain much of what is going on in the wider
world today.

SCOTTISH football will face its most demanding, as well as thrilling,
foreign test for many years next month as a result of the draw for the
European tournaments, which gave Celtic an autumn sojourn to Paris and
Raith Rovers their most exciting day out yet, against Munich.
Rovers take on Bayern in the the UEFA Cup second round on Tuesday,
October 17, at Easter Road while Celtic meet St Germain in their
Cup-winners' Cup tie on Thursday, October 19, in the Parc des Princes.
Sandwiched between them, on Wednesday, October 18, Rangers tackle
Juventus in Turin in the Champions League.
It is a treble whammy for the game's followers in Scotland. Both
Celtic and Raith wanted big names, both wanted reasonably good
travelling prospects and, after their recent experiences, both wanted a
tie that would excite the supporters. On all three counts they came up
trumps.
Celtic manager Tommy Burns respects the team that reached the
semi-finals of the European Cup last season, although they have since
lost their two finest players, George Weah to AC Milan, and David
Ginola, after turning down Celtic, to Newcastle United. But, said Burns:
''We know that the players they have bought have good reputations and it
will be a very tough two legs. The big thing is that it is another big
game for the club.''
Burns is well aware of the scenario if Celtic do get through. The
Parkhead club have not made it into the quarter final stage in Europe
for 16 years -- even team skipper Paul McStay has not played in Europe
beyond Christmas -- and the current staff could make a little bit of
history of their own.
Celtic chairman Fergus McCann is keen to meet the demand that there
will certainly be for the home leg on October 24. ''We will try to erect
a 3000 seat temporary stand for the game.''
Raith Rovers would need to erect a stand of Empire State Building
proportions at Stark's Park to meet the requirements for the biggest
game in the club's history and so deemed it easier to switch to Easter
Road, Edinburgh. The draw paired the teams at the Olympic Stadium,
Munich, but to accommodate German TV the tie was rearanged to give
Rovers home advantage first.
Nicholl had been praying for a home first leg. ''I had not wanted to
be trying to hold a team like Bayern in the first game; it was always
going to better for us to be doing our best to secure a lead at home,
with a big crowd behind us.''
Bayern, whose president is their most famous former player, Franz
Beckenbauer, are managed by Otto Rehagel, who replaced Italian Giovanni
Trappatoni this season. He has been doing spectacularly well, as his new
team have a 100 per cent record and sit atop the table.
The man who will draw the biggest interest, of course, is Jurgen
Klinsmann, who returned to Germany from Tottenham.
For the Kirkcaldy board, the draw has been just about perfect. They
had hoped most of all for a German side, with the benefits of their
all-encompassing TV coverage which will mean a #500,000 pay-off for the
club.
''If we do well in the first leg we will be playing in front of 50,000
people in the Olympic Stadium, with our supporters making the trip they
have always dreamed of,'' said Nicholl.
He is also serious when he says that Raith chose Easter Road because
of its slope, which is as steep as the one at Stark's Park. ''When they
see the slope they might have something to think about,'' he said.
''Obviously, they are favourites but we used to achieve the unachievable
with Northern Ireland, so who knows?''

PAKISTAN, fired by an unbeaten 102 from 19-year-old debutant Salim
Elahi, ignored police baton charges to coast to an easy victory over Sri
Lanka in the opening one-day international in Gujranawala yesterday.
Play was stopped for six minutes during the Pakistan innings when
police charged at part of the 15,000 crowd after Sri Lankan Pramodiya
Wickremasinghe was hit by an object thrown from the crowd.
The nine-wicket success was a boost for the home side after their
ignominious 2-1 defeat in the Test series.
And it was a particular blow for Sri Lanka skipper Arjuna Ranatunga
who also made 102 not out only to see his side swept away.
Chasing Sri Lanka's 233 for five in 50 overs, Pakistan reached the
target in the 44th over Pakistan lead the three-match series 1-0 with
games to follow on Sunday and Tuesday.
Named man of the match, Elahi became the first Pakistani and fourth
batsman in all after England's Dennis Amiss, West Indian Desmond Haynes
and Andy Flower of Zimbabwe to hit a century on his debut in the limited
overs game.
Included after regular opener Saeed Anwar failed a fitness test, Elahi
seized his chance, slamming seven fours and a six off 133 balls.
Pakistan lead the three-match series 1-0 with games to follow on
Sunday and Tuesday.

FORMER national keeper Uli Stein's claim that he was once offered
money by a rival coach to throw a game have been confirmed by German
football officials.
However, the German Soccer Federation said they would not take any
disciplinary action against Hannes Bongartz. Then in charge of
Kaiserslautern, Bongartz offered Stein, who was with SV Hamburg, more
than #11,500 to throw the final match of the 1986-87 season, the
goalkeeper has claimed.

THE advocates of more clubs being allowed into the top division in
Scottish football can have a field day. For the first time since 1947,
and only the second time since 1939, Dundee entertain city rivals Dundee
United in a lower division.
''Sad,'' was how manager Billy Kirkwood of United described it,
without going too much further. Yet, ''glad'' may be the verdict of the
paying customers -- and there are around 10,000 of them expected at Dens
Park today when the neighbours meet.
That soap opera about ''good neighbours being good friends'' and all
that jazz goes out the window -- even if both sides were playing in a
juvenile league.
The attraction of down the road, in this case, coming up the road and
the couple of hundred yards to Dens, is enough. And those in tangerine
should take heart from a battle in which both sides desperately seek
victory in this season's long and winding road towards promotion.
Statistics may show that, when the two met in a so-called lower
division, Dundee won each time by 2-0. But, in top-flight meetings, the
records show that the teams have squared up 45 times at Dens Park,
United winning 23 of them, drawing nine, and losing only 13. Quite
impressive.
United await fitness tests on Stephen Pressley, Billy McKinlay and
Brian Welsh before deciding their line-up, with 18-year-old Ben Honeyman
again in the squad.
Dundee will miss Dusan Vrto, and their long-term injuries, but as
manager Jim Duffy pointed out: ''There are very few players -- possibly
only five or six -- who will go out there today having experienced a
Dundee derby. That will add to the excitement of the game.''
Derbies elswhere also spring a few interesting clashes.
Dunfermline, beaten last week by Morton, and who came back to defeat
Brechin in the Challenge Cup, facing a St Johnstone side desperate to
turn their outfield skills into goals, at East End Park.
The Fifers will give new striker David Bingham his home debut, and
Norrie McCathie, Paul Smith, Ivo den Bieman, and Marc Millar are back in
contention.
Saints manager Paul Sturrock summed up his side's main problem. ''They
need to believe in themselves.'' Kevin McGowne is still out, but the
fit-again Jim Weir is already showing his influence.
The Greenock squad who travel to Paisley to face St Mirren certainly
have proved they have no problems in that area, in another
mouth-watering clash.
Airdrie also aim to follow last week's success at Tannadice when they
face Hamilton at Broadwood, while Chic Charnley returns to his Clydebank
roots for Dumbarton at Kilbowie. Family bereavement rules out Bankies'
Scott Murdoch.

STEPHEN Hendry needed the deciding frame to reach the last 16 of the
Thailand Classic in Bangkok last night.
The world champion beat Anthony Hamilton 5-4 after a final frame fluke
helped tip the match in his favour.
It came as Hendry put together a break of 44 which looked to have
ended when he missed a red. But fortunately for the Scot, the red
dropped into another pocket and he went on to compile a 64 which
effectively clinched the match.
''I had a slice of luck,'' admitted Hendry. ''But I expected a hard
match from Anthony as he has just won two events in Australia. He will
cause a few upsets in the future but at the moment really needs to beat
a big name.''
Alan McManus reached the next round when he defeated Dean Reynolds 5-3
and now will face either John Higgins or Andy Hicks for a place in the
quarter-finals.
Steve Davis beat Irishman Fergal O'Brien 5-3. ''Considering I was
playing in the first match on the first day of the season's first
ranking event, I'm quite pleased with my performance,'' said Davis.

COVE Rangers are counting the cost of their spectacular Qualifying Cup
exit last weekend as they return to league action today at Forres.
Their 7-2 thrashing by Peterhead last Saturday -- only the second time
in seven seasons that the Aberdeen side has failed to reach Scotland's
premier cup competition -- could deny them up to #20,000 in Scottish Cup
spin-offs.
Last season, they charged through to the third round, losing 4-0 to
Dunfermline in front of a large home crowd.
Devastated boss Kenny Taylor yesterday admitted that the disastrous
defeat has hit plans to strengthen his squad. ''I will find it very much
harder to make big signings. I'm personally shell-shocked,'' he said.
The last time Cove crashed out before the semi-final qualifying stages
was in 1991 when they lost to Ross County.
Qualifying Cup replays between Elgin and Brora, and Nairn and
Lossiemouth, mean pace-setters Keith are without a fixture.
Brora are set to unleash a double selection surprise for their biggest
match of the season so far. Manager Jim Kelly has moved for 23-year-old
former Brora youth team striker Walter Mackay, and also has another
lightening-paced attacker, Gary Morton, fit again.
Huntly, trailing Keith only on goal difference, have the chance to go
top - but only if they beat on-form Peterhead in the league match of the
day.

GLEDDOCH'S Steven Thompson gained a triple triumph, worth #10,800 to
him, at Glasgow Gailes yesterday when he beat Steve Martin at the first
extra hole in the 18-hole final to win the Edinburgh Crystal/Daily
Express Scottish Professional Matchplay championship. The 32-year-old
assistant achieved victory in exceptional fashion.
One down playing the last, Thompson holed out from 40 feet just off
the front of the green for a birdie 3 to square, Martin having laid a
putt of similar length dead for his par, and then at the first extra
hole struck a wedge shot to within four feet for another birdie 3 to
take the title.
Thompson earned the first prize of #4500 and a #3000 bonus for having
won the Ladbrokes Order of Merit table, leapfrogging four players to do
so. He extracted more money still from this sponsor, #3300, from the bet
of #100 placed at 33-1 by his wife, Margaret, who was his caddie this
week, even before Thompson missed the cut in the season's first
order-of-merit tournament, the Scottish Professional championship, at
Dalmahoy in May, a truly conjugal act of faith.
Thompson also qualified for the European Tour's final qualifying
school in November and claimed places in next year's Scottish Open and
Volvo PGA championships. But spare a thought for Martin, at 39 yet to
win an order-of-merit event, lost the Northern Open in June when Joe
Higgins, another Englishman, eagled the final hole and beat the
Dundonian, also with a birdie, at the first play-off hole. Results:
Semi-finals -- S Thompson (Gleddoch) beat B Marchbank (Marchbank Golf
Enterprises), #1500, 1 hole; S Martin (North Engineering) beat R Russell
(Longniddry), #1500, 1 hole. Final -- Thompson (#4500) beat Martin
(#3500), at 19th.

DAVID Coulthard proved that his pole position in Estoril recently was
no fluke when he landed provisional pole for tomorrow's European Grand
Prix at Nurburgring in Germany.
Indeed, so confident now is the young Scot that he even found time to
criticise his performance yesterday, saying he should have gone quicker.
''I'm happy with the balance of the car, but I am not entirely happy
with the way I drove,'' said the McLaren-bound Coulthard. ''I was a bit
too conservative.
''But the end result is I am quickest, it is good for the confidence.
But it is probably not a true indication because not everybody got a
full run because of the weather, and I was able to make best use of the
first run.
''I said when I got a win I would be an even better driver, but just
because you win one race doesn't mean you'll win the next. It is going
to be tough and it will be important to be on pole.
Coulthard's team-mate, Damon Hill, had to settle for second place in a
rain-affected first qualifying, but Hill believes his chances of
snatching the drivers' title have been boosted by the continued
superiority of his revised Williams car over that of Michael Schumacher.
''Michael has got a few problems,'' said Hill. ''He cannot be happy at
the moment. David and I have got the quicker cars and we have a good
advantage over the Benetton.''
To the disappointment of his home fans, Schumacher could finish only
third as grand prix racing returned after a 10-year absence to the
Nurburgring.
Schumacher, whose family home is just a short drive away, was
half-a-second down on Hill, who he leads by 17 points in the
championship. However, Hill warned: ''We have got to make that advantage
pay. If I can win the race and David comes second, then it will give me
something to go forward with.
''If it does not rain tomorrow, then I am sure the times will be
quicker. I believe I can go quicker than David but it is going to be a
very close thing for pole position.''
Eddie Irvine was the next best-placed Brit, celebrating his switch to
Ferrari for next season by splitting the Italian team's two current
drivers with a fifth place.
But Irvine warned: ''The times are close. Luckily, we are at the front
of the bunch but one little mistake in second qualifying and we could
very easily slip down to tenth.''

SPAIN'S Amaia Arruti fixed her sights on a second Italian Open title
when she shot a second-round 69 to lead the field at the halfway stage
at Il Picciolo, Sicily, yesterday.
With a six-under-par, two-round total of 140 Arruti, who won the title
at Lignano two years ago in only her sixth appearance as a professional,
leads by two strokes from Scotland's Julie Forbes and Denise Booker,
from Australia.
Gillian Stewart also made up ground with a second-round 70 to finish
on 145. She claimed her first hole-in-one as a professional when she saw
her No.8-iron tee shot disappear into the hole at the 137-yard eighth.
Overnight leader Lora Fairclough slumped to a 79 to drop seven strokes
off the pace, with the new leader carding eight birdies in her round of
69 five of which came in seven holes from the ninth. Leading scores (GB
and Irish unless stated):

AUSTRALIA's Ian Schuback lines up in Preston today as the lone
challenger to Scottish dominance of the Saga International Open.
Schuback ended hopes of an all-Scottish semi-final when he beat Richard
Corsie in five sets yesterday.
Corsie surrendered a 5-2 lead in the opener as his arch rival hit back
to snatch a 7-6 win, but the Scot took the second 7-5. Schuback took the
third 7-3, Corsie edged the fourth 7-6, but Schuback hit back from 3-1
down to take the decider 7-3.
Earlier, Scottish champion Paul Conlan, from Midlothian, joined Hugh
Duff in the semi-finals when he beat the last of the Crown-green
players, Noel Burrows, in five sets. Conlan dropped the opener 2-7 but
moved ahead when he took both the second and third sets 7-1.
Burrows grabbed a lifeline when he came from behind to take the fourth
set 7-6, but Conlan led all the way in the decider, winning 7-0 to wrap
up a deserved victory.
Schuback will meet Graham Robertson, who claimed the last semi-final
spot late last night when he edged out fellow Scots international David
Gourlay Jr in five sets. Results:
Quarter-finals -- P Conlan (Scotland) beat N Burrows (Crown Green)
2-7, 7-1, 7-1, 6-7, 7-0; I Schuback (Australia) beat R Corsie (Scotland)
7-6, 5-7, 7-3, 6-7, 7-3; G Robertson (Scotland) beat D Gourlay Jun
(Scotland) 7-1, 7-5, 6-7, 6-7, 7-4.

SANDY Lyle has not had a tour victory ince the Italian Open in 1992.
Yet, as he pulled to within two shots of the lead in the #650,000
Smurfit Irish Open at the K Club near Dublin yesterday, the big Scot,
surely the most liked competitor in the business, vowed that the famine
was about to end.
''There are far too many good things happening for me to stay a loser
for much longer,'' insisted the former Open champion after a second 70.
''I am driving the ball very well, hitting my irons lower, which is what
I have been working on, and a few putts are dropping. It has been a
long, hard road but I think I see the end of it.'' He has had only two
bogeys in as many days.
Lyle opened with a cracking birdie on the first, hitting a No.3 wood
to 25 feet. He also birdied the par-5 seventh, holing a 12-footer. He
dropped his only shot at the short seventeenth, where he found sand, but
made up for that with a glorious No.5 iron to 18 feet at the last.
The man he may have to beat is fellow-Scot Colin Montgomerie who moved
menacingly to join Lyle on the four-under mark. Montgomerie admits he is
mentally tired after his Ryder Cup exertions, but he is second to no-one
in determination. ''I am here to defend my No.1 spot in Europe -- and
for no other reason.''
Montgomerie had a 69, which included two birdies on the outward half
and also a 6 at the thirteenth, where he three-putted. There was a
momentary explosion as he cursed the greens -- as have most of the
players -- but it is a measure of the man that he went straight back to
work again. He arrowed a No.7 iron to 10 feet at the seventeenth then
grabbed another birdie at the last.
Someone dared to suggest Monty might be a tad over-weight. ''Listen,
when you are playing as well as I am you don't change anything. My only
weakness is food.'' He also joked about his order-of-merit battle with
Ryder Cup team-mate Sam Torrance. ''He keeps calling me No.2!''
Torrance, only #29,000 ahead of Montgomerie, is now six shots behind
him in this tournament. ''I just couldn't put it together today,'' he
admitted. At least Torrance has, at last, been told officially that he
will play in the World Matchplay at Wentworth next month. A faxed
invitation arrived at his hotel -- the acceptance was immediate.
Paul Lawrie is the other Scot firmly in contention this week. He came
in with a steady 72 which kept him on the three-under mark. ''I am
playing really well and might have finished a couple of shots better,''
the Aberdonian related. ''After my lousy season this is just
wonderful.''
England's Barry Lane was the lone figure at the head of the
leaderboard for much of the day and that is where he stayed. He added a
71 to his first-round 67 which included an eagle at the eighteenth, his
No.2 iron finishing only a couple of feet from the pin. ''Conditions
were better out there today, but it was tougher to score,'' he declared,
the kind of comment one expects from an Irishman.
Roger Chapman went on a six-birdie spree which brought him a course
record of 66 and a cheque for #3000 if his score is not beaten or
matched in the next two days. ''I was under a lot of pressure,'' he
admitted, ''because I am forty-third in the order of merit and needed to
make the cut to be sure of playing in the Volvo Masters next month.''
At the start of the day, New Zealander Michael Campbell was installed
as 5-1 favourite by the local bookies. After his 77 the promising rookie
was well out of contention. ''I couldn't hit a cow with a banjo,'' he
declared.
Domingo Hospital of Spain had a hole-in-one at the 170-yard twelfth
using a No.5 iron. This was not the best place to achieve this feat -- a
car worth #18,500 was on offer for an ace at the seventeenth. Leading
scores (British or Irish unless stated):
138 -- B Lane 67, 71.
140 -- C Montgomerie 71, 69; S Lyle 70, 70; C Mason 67, 73; S Ames
(Trinidad) 69, 71.
141 -- O Rojahn (Norway) 73, 68; J Haeggman (Sweden) 71, 70; F Tarnaud
(France) 68, 73; R Burns 72, 69; P Lawrie 69, 72; A Forsbrand (Sweden)
70, 71.
142 -- S Struver (Germany) 71, 71; P Broadhurst 70, 72; T Lehman (USA)
70, 72; M James 72, 70; K Eriksson (Sweden) 70, 72.
Other sores included: 143 -- P-U Johansson (Sweden) 72, 71. 144 -- B
Langer (Germany) 74, 70; C Rocca (Italy) 69, 75; I Woosnam 72, 72; D

Non-qualifiers included: 149 -- R Drummond 75, 74; G Brand Jr 71, 78.
150 -- G Orr 74, 76; C Cassells 73, 77. 151 -- A Oldcorn 76, 75. 154 --

ONE of the curiosities of Derby-Day fixtures in the lower divisions is
that neighbours Stirling Albion and Stenhousemuir have been kept apart
today.
The clubs who have a high-profile meeting next week in the League
Challenge Cup semi-final, shared the points at Ochilview three week's
ago and will have no time today to dwell on their forthcoming meeting as
both have difficult home fixtures.
'Muir are hosts to table-topping East Fife, who will be out to close
down the opposition as successfully as they did when they visited
Stirling a month ago. It could well be decided by set pieces, with Terry
Christie's men a danger at corners, while former Warrior Dave Beaton can
be deadly if East Fife gain any free kicks within range.
Forthbank sees a contest between Albion and Clyde, perhaps the two
most attractive footballing sides in the division, although both are
stuck in mid-table. Clyde's Jim Brown, sent off last week, sits this one
out.
While Stranraer have got off to a better start than Ayr, with whom
they were relegated last season, the Somerset Park club got off the mark
last week with victory at Montrose, and caretaker-manager Gordon Dalziel
will want a repeat in front of their home fans. Ayr's Vinnie Moore is
banned after last week's red card.
Second-placed Berwick make the trip to Dumfries, where Queen of the
South's Andy McFarlane is automatically suspended, while third-placed
Forfar also have a red card victim, Don McVicar, who misses the visit by
winless Montrose.
Jim Leishman's Livingston would like to maintain their unbeaten record
for their homecoming in a few weeks' time, but it will be put to the
test this afternoon at the club nearest to the manager's Kelty home,
Cowdenbeath.
A considerably larger crowd will be at Inverness, where Caley Thistle
host Ross County. The home side put five goals past Alloa last week, but
County have lost only one league match.
Concerned about his leaking defence, Alloa manager Pat McAulay expects
a much tighter performance today at Firs Park. However, East
Stirlingshire deserve better luck and could well obtain their first
league win.
There is not much to choose between second-placed Brechin and John
Brogan's Arbroath in the Angus derby, but it will be a surprise if lowly
Albion Rovers can repeat last season's home win over Queen's Park,
although their spirited show away to Livingston last week will have
given Rovers manager Jimmy Crease some encouragement.

BRIAN Barnes yesterday limped out of the London Masters in Sevenoaks
to again put his career in jeopardy. The big Scot struggled round 14
holes in five over par before his right leg, badly swollen from an
ongoing bloodclotting problem, forced him to quit.
Barnes had been resting on a portable chair between shots, but
admitted: ''I just daren't risk it any longer. My leg is already swollen
so much I may have to cut off my trousers.''
The Senior British Open champion had been in hospital for nearly four
weeks after having pulled out of the Scottish Senior Open earlier this
month. He will see his specialist on Monday before deciding whether to
travel to Zurich for next week's Lexus Trophy, the final event on this
year's PGA European Seniors Tour.
Meanwhile, 59-year-old former PGA champion Tony Grubb swept into a
two-stroke, first-round lead with a four-under-par 68 achieved with a
newly-acquired broomstick putter.
''I had been putting so badly I had to try something new,'' said
Grubb, who ran in three successive birdies from the sixth and notched
three more in a back nine of three-under-par 33.
He leads by two from South Africans John Bland -- making his senior
debut after having turned 50 last week -- and Hugh Inggs. Scottish
former Ryder up player George Will is on 71. Leading scores (British or
Irish unless stated):
68 -- T Grubb. 70 -- H Inggs (S Africa), J Bland (S Africa). 71 -- D
Butler, J Morgan, G Will. 72 -- B Whittle, F Abreu (Spain), B Verwey (S
Africa), B Hunt, F Hill, L Higgins. 73 -- W Sauer (USA), N Coles, C
Evans (USA), C O'Connor, J Fourie (S Afria).
Gallacher, the European Ryder Cup captain, has been named as the
Johnnie Walker Golfer of the Month for September.

We will take our thrills out of the fact that we are referred to as
'only Raith Rovers' yet we are about to play in the second round in
Europe.
WHEN the young and zealous Alex Ferguson was attempting to resuscitate
St Mirren 20 years ago there were many close observers of the football
scene who would have placed a sizeable wager that there was a manager
destined for the major stage.
He has probably achieved a wee bit more than even his admirers
suspected would come his way, but that was down to getting the right job
at the right time.
There are many football folk who would pick out Jimmy Nicholl as
another young manager who could end up making a considerable impression
on the game and already he does seem to be fitting in with one of
Ferguson's own cherished aphorisms: ''It is better to be lucky than
good.''
The blessed fortune that was instrumental in seeing his Raith Rovers
team through to the second round of the UEFA Cup in Iceland during the
week is a pre-requisite of the ambitious manager. It was present in the
early career of Jock Stein, who would be assessed by most of us as the
best of all, as well as Jim McLean in his heyday at Dundee United, and
Billy McNeill in his successful times at Parkhead.
Along with the luck, as Fergie well knew, had to come the ability to
do all the myriad functions of the job well. Good man-management,
tactical know-how, innovative thinking, and expert player judgment are
only some of the aspects which have to be mastered but maybe most of all
is the intuitive gift to know when to do things differently.
At any rate, Nicholl is beginning to look like the man most likely to
succeed, but if he would be flattered to hear these things, he would
also insist, in that Northern Irish brogue, that there is no profit in
trying to look ahead in football. Like most of his peers, he finds the
old one-game-at-a-time cliche not only helps prevent tempting fate but
allows the single minded concentration needed for the job.
Since he took over as manager at Kirkcaldy almost five years ago,
Nicholl has achieved nearly all of the targets he set for himself and
the club. The first division championship has been won, promotion to the
premier division was secured, and the supreme bonus of a major trophy
has been added. The only failure in his view was the team's inability to
hold on to its top league place two years ago.
Despite all the excitement of European involvement, that simple aim
remains his priority. In fact, he would tell you that, unless there is a
radical change in Raith Rovers' financial status, the ultimate that can
be secured is a regular place in the middle of the premier division,
although he believes that league will one day be extended.
On a few occasions it has seemed as if the former Rangers and
Manchester United player would have been watching Rovers' exploits from
a distance, as Northern Ireland, Kilmarnock, and Norwich became
interested in his talents.
He could not reach agreement with the Irish about how he wanted to do
the international job, Rovers did not give Kilmarnock permission to
speak to him when they were seeking a successor to Tommy Burns -- he
fell out with the board over that -- and he was beaten to the Norwich
post last summer by Irish colleague Martin O'Neil.
Does he regret the consequence of his seeking the Norwich post, when
he was pictured being shown around the ground although O'Neil was
apparently odds-on for the job?
''No, not all. In fact, I would do the same again if I had to go back.
The thing was, if I had sat on my backside and not gone to talk to
Norwich, people would have said: 'Oh, aye, look at Nicholl, he is on a
cushy wee number and doesn't have the nerve to try anything different.'
What I had to say to myself was: 'Go for it and see what happens.' ''
Did he then have problems remotivating himself for the new season? He
finds the question puzzling, maybe because he is of the type who never
requires refuelling.
''Maybe if things weren't happening here it would be different, but I
keep on saying about players, and it applies to managers, too: 'If there
are things going on at the club, you don't just up and away at the first
opportunty.' If we were back in the first division and part-time, we
would have gone full circle and maybe I would think: 'That's it, we have
exhausted it here.'
''But it is not like that. It just seems to be on the up and up all
the time.''
He admits that, when other opportunities do arrive, any manager has to
be careful to say the right things because ''you have to come back to
your players.''
He doesn't feel quite the same about directors' feelings. He laughs as
he says it: ''You have to bear in mind that, if they tell you to go
ahead and speak to somebody else, it might be a double-edged sword.
People might have wondered what Nicholl was going to put into the job
after the summer but I think they know now.''
He recognises the fact that few outside Kirkcaldy will recognise the
club's success in getting through to the second round of the UEFA Cup as
particularly special, simply because the opponents, teams from the
Faroes and Iceland, are not rated.
''I know that but you still have to do it. We will take our thrills
out of the fact that we are referred to as 'only Raith Rovers' yet we
are about to play in the second round in Europe. And look at who we are
playing, one of the biggest names in European football. It is a
tremendous thrill for this club, its players and supporters to be going
to the Olympic Stadium in Munich to face Bayern.''
Nicholl accepts that the expectations of the locals has been rising at
a rate that will become impossible unless there is some realism applied.
''The limit to what can be done here is the same limit as the resources.
I always look at the Coventries of the Premiership in England and try to
imagine them winning the championship but I can't. However, you can see
them staying in the top league and that is much the same as here.
''We will never be able to compete in the transfer market so if we can
hold our own that would be the limit but what a limit compared to what
it was.''
His message to his players since the Coca-Cola Cup success has been
that the hardest thing is winning the first trophy. ''Now I can see
players who think they are better than average and they can take on
teams with some confidence as well as hope. There are no prima donnas in
this squad and obviously, if they start believing they are better than
they are, we have had it.''
Nicholl has always maintained that, under the financial restrictions,
no one at Stark's Park should begin to get fanciful ideas. ''Until the
day and hour comes when we can get 10,000 into this ground regularly for
games against the likes of Partick Thistles and Kilmarnock, we will have
to be a selling club. We cannot give these players a standard of living
they can get elsewhere.''
He points out that his team was playing in front of 800 in games
against Meadowbank, etc, a few years ago. ''The average has risen to
1300, to 2500, 3500, 4500 and now 5500, we can't complain.''
Will Nicholl, who still likes to remind you that he is player-manager,
decide to pack up the boots at the end of this season? The answer is an
emphatic ''no.''
He reckons he is still able to come on as a substitute in less
demanding games. ''I played for the reserves at left back the other day
and I was trying to gallop up and down the wing. I just couldn't do it.
But I think in an emergency I could play at the back.''
The truth is that he still loves getting the boots on. ''I was playing
with all the YTS kids against Aberdeen and we got beat 8-0 but I enjoyed
it. It was great.'' He had harboured a dream that his wee club would run
out at Old Trafford for the next chapter of their European story.
Ironically, it was Alex Ferguson's side that let him down. Now, none the
less, he will take his men into the most thrilling tie in the cluib's
history convinced that his biggest advantage is the way the world refers
to the Fifers as ''Only Raith Rovers.''
Bayern present an enormous test for his wee team but Nicholl has
enjoyed defying the odds and it might be foolish to imagine that he or
Rovers are finished in that department.

STEADY Steve Stricker, refreshed after a fortnight off, shot a
bogey-free, five-under-par 67 to grab the lead after the second round at
the $1m Buick Challenge in Pine Mountain, Georgia, yesterday.
Stricker compiled five birdies in a light-to-moderate breeze at
Callaway Gardens to post an 11-under 133 halfway total, two better than
former European Tour campaigner Glen Day.
World No.1 Greg Norman is six behind after a 68, Open champion John
Daly (70) trails by eight, while defending champion Steve Elkington
missed the cut, which was made at one-under 143.
Stricker made 26 successive cuts on the American Tour before his
impressive streak ended at Milwaukee four weeks weeks ago. He also
missed the cut at the following week's Canadian Open, which prompted him
to have two weeks off. ''I didn't pick up a club for eight days. I feel
refreshed and relaxed again,'' said the 28-year-old, who is No.37 on the
US Tour money list, and is running out of time to vault into the top 30
and qualify for the end-of-season $3m US Tour Championship. Leading
scores (Americans unless stated):
133 -- Steve Stricker 66, 67. 135 -- Glen Day 68, 67. 136 -- Jeff
Sluman 67, 69; John Adams 68, 68; Ted Tryba 69, 67; Justin Leonard 69,
67; Larry Nelson 71, 65; Steve Lowery 66, 70; Fred Funk 69, 67.
Other scores -- 139 -- Loren Roberts 70, 69; Greg Norman (Australia)
71, 68. 140 -- Ben Crenshaw 70, 70. 141 -- John Daly 71, 70. 145 --
Steve Elkington (Australia) 71, 74. 147 -- David Feherty (N Ireland) 73,
74. 151 -- Stephen Keppler (England) 71, 80. 162 -- Ian Baker-Finch
(Australia) 81, 81.
* THERE was a four-way tie on one-under-par 71 in the Rehab Pro-Am at
the Dave Thomas-designed Newmachar course, near Aberdeen yesterday.
Local player David Thompson was joined by Lee Vannet, Gary Harvey, and
Russell Weir. Leading scores:
71 -- D Thompson (King's Links); L Vannet (Carnoustie); G Harvey
(Grangemouth); R Weir (Cowal). 72  -- T Coles (King James VI); P Smith
(Deeside); F Mann (Musselburgh); G Weir (Braid Hills). 73 -- S Henderson
(King's Links); K Hutton (Downfield); C Elliott (Dubai Creek); G
Collinson (Windyhill). Leading team score: 62 -- C Ronald (East
Kilbride), P Lefever, G Clark, F Lefever (Quantum Claims).

Senior members of the British Veterinary Association have asked the
Government to press the European Commission to change the wording on
export certificates for live animals.
The move follows two cases where local veterinary inspectors, who had
signed export certificates without verifying all the facts, were
prosecuted under the Trades Descriptions Act. A false trade description
had been applied in regard to calves destined for the export market,
creating the possibility of an unfair trading advantage.
Graham Venn, a Yorkshire trading standards officer, told the British
Veterinary Association congress in Winchester that vets were not being
persecuted -- but they were being made subject to the same rules as car
clockers and forgers.
He warned that vets should comply with their own 12 principles of
certification and should refuse to certify anything they could not
verify for themselves. Only by showing that they had taken all
reasonable precautions and exercised all due diligence could they offer
a defence.
However, BVA members have pointed out that the wording on the
certificates makes it impossible for them to comply in all cases.

<HEADLINE>Ngugi in $10m law suit over ban</HEADLINE>

JOHN Ngugi, Kenya's former Olympic 5000 metres champion, is preparing
a $10m law suit against those who deprived him of more than three years
of his athletics career.
Ngugi, who confirmed last night that he will race tomorrow in the BUPA
Great Caledonian Run in Edinburgh, is competing for the first time since
the lifting, in ''exceptional circumstances,'' of a suspension for
refusing a dope test.
''Yes, we are taking legal advice,'' confirmed his agent, former
Olympic steeplechaser John Bicourt. ''For loss of reputation and
earnings, plus damages, it could be $10m.''
Bicourt has persuaded Ngugi that tomorrow's field, including
Scotland's World Mountain Race silver medallist Tom Murray, and former
world 10,000m champion Liz McColgan, should be low key enough not to
embarrass on his first race for three years.
Ngugi donned three track suits and water proofs for a training run
designed to shed more of the excess weight which he guiltily believes he
is carrying. Yesterday, he sheepishly showed the notch holes on his belt
-- five-and-a-half inches tighter now than when he began training again
when reprieved in May.
Ngugi still does not grasp why he was banned. Though he speaks three
languages, English among them, he does not read English, the language on
the card shown him by former miler John Whetton, who arrived to conduct
a random test in 1992.
Ngugi saw nothing to demonstrate the validity of Whetton's authority,
whose arrogant approach was likened to that of a white bwana among the
natives.
''What white athlete would have accepted the credentials, in Swahali,
or whatever, of a black Kenyan who arrived in England demanding a urine
sample?'' ventured Bicourt.
One letter which Bicourt has seen, from another doping case in Kenya,
referred to their ''staking out'' an athlete's ''watering hole,'' their
excitement when the ''prey'' arrived, and enthusiasm at a ''good day's
bag.''
''It was the most racist thing you ever read,'' said Bicourt. ''No
wonder Kenyans are suspicious.''
It took three years for the world body of athletics to absorb Ngugi's
logic, and lift the ban. Throughout that time he maintained the sense of
humour which saw him name his sons Saddam and Bush.
''Saddam? Because he is a little criminal, like Hussain,'' laughs
Ngugi. ''Bush? Because he is a famous man.''
Ngugi, enjoys some of the later status himself. ''I want to win the
world cross-country for a sixth time, next year,'' he said. Nor does he
rule out a world record at 10,000m, or a place in the Atlanta Olympic
team.

IN its 12 years of existence the City of Glasgow Chorus has, like
Topsy, growed and growed. Today it has 140 members -- with more sought
-- and performs on average 12 concerts a year. All this is a far cry
from the original yearly extravaganza envisaged by its founding father
and music director Graham Taylor.
Since 1983, when it began with a dozen enthusiasts, the standard of
vocal talent has continued to rise as the engagements the chorus has
been invited to undertake have built up and become increasingly
prestigious. ''In the early years we did one or two concerts a year, but
the 1990 City of Culture was the turning point,'' Taylor explains. ''We
decided to put on a performance of Mahler's Eighth Symphony, the first
time in 16 years it had been performed in Glasgow. The chorus really
made a name for itself then.''
The opening of Glasgow Royal Concert Hall brought what has become a
regular teaming up with the City of Glasgow Philharmonic Orchestra.
''They ask us to perform some three or four concerts every season,''
says Taylor.
In addition to these and the chorus's own free annual concert, another
six or so are commissioned by other organisations. Next June will see
the diva Lesley Garrett sing with the chorus at the Concert Hall, while
October, 1996 will see them travel to Prague to take up a week-long
invitation to perform there.
Having started out in 1983 as The New Glasgow Singers, a change of
name to the City of Glasgow Chorus in celebration of its first decade,
was deemed appropriate.
New members are being sought, especially those elusive male voices of
which there is a dearth in most choirs. What are the criteria for
membership of this highly-successful group?
''As well as good singing voices, we need people to have a grasp of
the rudiments of music -- although we don't expect them to be top
quality sight readers,'' says Taylor.
The commitment, he explains, is once-weekly, on Tuesday evenings.The
rewards, he believes, are considerable: ''To perform these great choral
works with a professional orchestra is quite an experience.''
Anyone interested in the chorus's programme of events, should contact
Glasgow's Royal Concert Hall booking office for details, while those
wishing further information on joining the choir, should ring Graham
Taylor on 0141 339 6153.

THE adoption of a free market system in the European Union would put
most Scottish farmers out of business, John Scott, president of the Ayr
area of the National Farmers' Union of Scotland has warned.
Speaking at an executive meeting in Ayr Mr Scott said the British
Government should pay no need to the siren voices advocating an end to
the CAP as presently constituted.
Change would serve no purpose if it meant throwing the baby out with
the bathwater, he said.
''Those we have to look to for guidance in Brussels have got it right.
''The view taken there is long-term. The CAP reforms are working and
provide a guaranteed food supply. Thirty-six million people within the
European trade bloc have a system of supply management which can
increase or decrease food production as required.
''I believe we need all the food we produce -- and that has been
recognised by the recent reduction in set-aside levels.''
William Campbell, newly elected livestock convener for the Ayr area,
supported Mr Scott. If controls were removed production would be a lot
more than the market could absorb, he forecast. ''Prices would plummet
and farmers would be producing a helluva lot, for a helluva lot less.''
Milk convener Ian Kerr was critical of those in positions of power who
appeared to be looking forward to the end of the milk quota system. One
of the most outspoken in that category was Tony Baldry, Minister of
State at the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, he said. ''He
seems convinced we are heading towards a free market Utopia.
''I think that is very dangerous, coming from people in power like
that,'' The NFU will have to speak out strongly on our behalf against
these characters.''
There was some concern, however, that the current quota system placed
a block on potential new-entrants to the dairy industry. Quota had
become a valuable asset, regarded by many as a ''retirement fund''.
John Hare pointed out that in Dalry parish alone five farms had gone
out of dairying in the past year for various reasons. Units were getting
larger and larger.
The new-entrant problem in Britian, was the worst in Europe, said
William Campbell. ''Should we not start making sure that quota does
become available. A few years ago extra quota was issued but Britain
just passed an extra one per cent on to all producers. Other countries
used it to create a pool to supply new-entrants.''
He pointed out that the Republic of Ireland had a vibrant dairy
industry with a lot of young people coming into it. ''Nobody wants to
see the quota system done away with but we need to do something,'' he
said.

UK PRODUCERS of Aberdeen-Angus beef should concentrate on high-class
niche markets that are crying out for supplies, Ralph Green, managing
director of meat wholesalers McIntosh Donald, told delegates at the
breed's 'Heritage 95' event at Inverurie, writes JEANNE GAVIN.
Mr Green, whose company is based at Portlethen outside Aberdeen, said
there was still not enough Aberdeen-Angus beef to go round in Britain.
Marketing groups should concentrate on providing what the quality
outlets required, especially the independent High Street butcher.
There was a real demand but not for little 200kg heifers, he said.
Quality retailers were looking for something in the 280kg-320kg range.
His own company had a regular order from one customer but often they did
not have beef of the right quality to fill it.
Aberdeen-Angus cattle handled by McIntosh Donald in one year would be
about 600 head, out of an annual total kill of 70,000. Supplies,
particularly of the right type of cattle, were far short of demand.
Looking to the immediate future, Mr Green advised producers to look at
two major areas -- increasing carcase weight and concentrating on
high-class, niche outlets.

Unhappy coaches forced to re-apply for their own jobs
MANY of Scotland's leading athletics gurus say they would rather quit
than reapply for their jobs, which they will be required to do under a
restructuring of the coaching system by the country's full-time national
coach, Andy Vince.
If they carry out their threat, the foundations of the system, badly
in need of under-pinning, may be less secure. Even Vince's supporters
concede that the loss of event coaches and co-ordinators, some with more
than 30 years' experience, would be seriously damaging.
Vince's proposals include axing the council of coaches, instituted 20
years ago by former national coaching director Frank Dick.
The aim is a much-needed, more integrated set-up, backed by
initiatives jointly funded by regional authorities and the Scottish
Sports Council, and by sponsors who are currently being sought.
Vince's revamp, claim his critics, has been characterised by lack of
consultation, poor man-management, and lack of diplomacy. Most coaches
were unaware their posts were in jeopardy until they received a letter
earlier this month. And even though these critics acknowledge the new
''coaching and performance structure'' has merit, they claim it is
unworkable.
They say it would take superman to fulfil the 18-point coach and job
specification, which demands more time than they are capable of giving.
More specifically, they would be unable to do what they do best -- coach
athletes.
National event coaches are volunteers, and almost all hold full-time
employment outside sport. Tom Bolan, national coach for 400 metres
hurdles, is typical of those who put in around 25 hours a week, every
week of the year, and almost double that at peak times, in addition to a
day job.
For all that, coaches receive a derisory honorarium, #120 per year,
paid in four cheques of #30 -- often never cashed.
''You do this for the love of it, not the money,'' said Bolan, who has
produced more than a dozen internationalists in his 17-years as a coach.
''I am not making a personal attack on Andy. But I was disappointed and
saddened by the letter, and the whole principle of reapplication. There
was no consultation that I'm aware of, and no advance warning.''
Brian McAusland, national group coach for endurance events, and Iain
Cosgrove, national event coach for 100m, 200m, and sprint relays, are
among at least a dozen coaches who say they will not reapply.
McAusland has coached for 31 years, nurturing more than senior 20
internationalists. He currently has four international 800m runners,
including Des Roache, UK No1. at both 800 and 1500m.
''I don't like the inadequate consultation,'' said McAusland. ''I will
go my own way, with my own athletes.''
The consequences for the new structure, with regional squads and
age-group teams being established, would be fraught. The prospect of
former event coaches establishing working relationships with people who
have taken over as their successors is improbable.
The proposals, which the coaches learned of in a letter from coaching
committee chairman Janet Leyland, have, however, been agreed unanimously
by the committee.
Rowland Hill, who is both national group coach for the long, high and
triple jumps, and pole vault, and national high jump event coach, said
he was one of eight coaches who met last weekend. All expressed anger or
disappointment with their treatment, and there was the perhaps
predictable concensus view that the new deal would struggle without
their support.
Banchory-based Dr Dinkar Sabnis, national triple jump coach, who was
appointed by Vince to assist with last year's Commonwealth Games team,
brushed aside perceptions of a dutiful accolyte.
Dr Sabnis, who has found great job satisfaction in coaching since
taking early retirement from his career as a senior university lecturer,
has serious reservations: ''I agonised over this, but I have decided to
reapply.
''Damage has been done, but the most important thing is the future of
Scottish athletics -- how we move forward. Peoples' feelings are
secondary.''
One positive note is the return to the fold of cross-country expert
Alex Naylor, who once resigned as endurance co-ordinator because Vince
would not let him use his coaching expertise. But he is applying for the
country job. However, there are more heretics than converts.
National coach Vince, who now wishes to be styled technical director,
insists there is widespread support for his proposals. ''If some coaches
want to go it alone, that is unfortunate,'' he said. ''It's not in the
sport's best interests. But my folder is full of applications. The first
tranche of appointments, for which applications close a week tomorrow,
will go ahead as planned.''
He insisted there had been consultation, and that if national event
coaches were left in the dark, then it was the fault of group
co-ordinaters. ''There were meetings as long ago as May. The
co-ordinators were supposed to disseminate the information, and I hoped
they would have done that. A chain is only as strong as its weakest
link.
''But I must point out that these are new jobs, with new
specifications -- people would not be applying for their previous jobs.
The days of waiting until people get tired of doing a job are gone.
There have to be opportunities for promotion. People viewed these jobs
as a closed shop. I want to make it clear they are open to anyone, and
to give coaches more kudos.
''This is not a rehash of an old model -- it is designed to halt
declining performances.''
However, it may give some of the unhappy coaches food for thought that
some very significant figures are out in the cold ahead of them.
Tom Boyle, who coached both Tom McKean and Yvonne Murray to inarguably
the greatest catalogue of titles of any Scottish middle distance coach,
despite offering his help, has been consulted only once by Vince in four
years.
''The only way to improve Scottish athletics is to get the best people
on board, and find incentives to keep them on board -- and I don't mean
money,'' said Boyle.
''I have not been as fortunate as Tommy,'' added John Anderson, who
has coached a catalogue of world class athletes, including Liz McColgan
and Dave Moorcroft. The first man to hold the post now occupied by
Vince, Anderson made a similar offer: ''But Andy has never come back to
me in four years.''
Before building Vince's vision, fences need mending round the
construction site.
Little wonder one coach, who for his own sake must remain nameless,
keeps the following on his study wall:
''We trained very hard, but it seemed that every time we were
beginning to form up into teams, we would be reorganised. I was to learn
later in life that we tend to meet any new situation by reorganising,
and a wonderful method it can be for creating the illusion of progress
while producing confusion, inefficiency, and demoralisation.'' -- Gaius
Petronius, Rome's Prefect in Egypt, AD 66.

DECORATED Hero can land the Cambridgeshire for trainer John Gosden.
Lightly-raced three-year-olds have an excellent record in this race, and
the selection certainly fits that mould.
After having won his first two starts in moderate company, he showed
much greater ability when a close third to Charnwood Forest, who had
previously run Bahri to four lengths at Royal Ascot.
Decorated Hero has since put up two fine performances in large
handicaps and seems to progress with every run. Starting from stall
No.1, close to many of the fancied runners, he looks ideally placed to
score.
Naked Welcome looks sure to run a big race, but Blisland beat him by
more than eight lengths at Goodwood and presents sound each-way claims.
There is no stopping trainer Mark Johnston this season and he should
win the Jockey Club Cup with Double Eclipse. Having run his illustrious
older brother Double Trigger to a neck in the Goodwood Cup, he went on
to take York's Lonsdale Stakes, on which form he holds Cuff Link and Old
Rouvel.
Kelso's main event, the Famous Grouse Chase, can go to Spanish Fair.
Sue Bramall's charge was a youthful novice chaser last term, as he
showed when winning at the Border's course in November.
Although his form tailed off towards the season's end, he is once more
in prime condition, to judge from an impressive win at Huntingdon
earlier this month, and he should prove too quick for Rusty Blade.
Look out for Kandyan in Chepstow's Free Hurdle. A decent sort on the
Flat, the son of Shareef Dancer made an eye-catching hurdling debut at
Edinburgh in February but then suffered a set-back.
As a result he is unexposed but promising and could go very well at a
decent price.
* NAKED Welcome, again wearing blinkers, can take the Cambridgeshire
Handicap, writes White and Gold.
The colt was at his best as a juvenile when equipped with such
headgear and has an undeniable chance of collecting the big prize on
offer.
With a fast pace virtually assured, Naked Welcome should be the one to
take advantage and land the spoils.

THE Government is to press ahead with its plans to create a more
market orientated farming industry, Agriculture Minister Douglas Hogg
said yesterday.
This would be combined with measures to deal with specific social,
rural, and environmental issues as outlined in the recent Common
Agricultural Policy review group paper.
Mr Hogg said the public would not continue to tolerate the high costs
of the CAP and is increasingly critical of a number of payments to
farmers, particularly when associated with set-aside -- a ''policy whose
logic I confess is immensely difficult to explain.''
It was doubtful if European taxpayers would be willing to shoulder the
high costs of extending CAP support measures to Central and Eastern
European countries -- a possible 50% increase over the current #34bn a
year budget -- quite apart from financing future productivity increases
within Europe.
Mr Hogg, who was giving the annual Bledesloe Lecture at the Royal
Agricultural College in Cirencester, pointed out that multi-lateral
negotiations on world trade with the aim of further reducing support and
protection were due to start in 1999.
''I am not saying that these pressures will lead to change overnight.
But we must be prepared for when they come. That is why the Government
has called for an early debate about what changes must be made to the
CAP.''

Illness, particularly when it affects key staff, can be a serious
threat to individuals and businesses. Francis Shennan looks at ways of
preventing problems
THE loss of a job or the collapse of a business -- with the loss of
many jobs -- has a profound effect on workers, including management and
their families. Business is tough enough without adding to the risks.
Yet jobs and companies can disappear for reasons other than redundancy
or bad trading conditions. Very often the cause can be the effects of
your own illness, or even the illness of another person who is key to
the business.
Many employers are unaware of the risks they face and the protection
that is available. A Department of Social Security inquiry into hospital
in-patients in 1993 showed one in 10 men will suffer a heart attack
before the age of 65.
The same department's statistics show that one in 10 executives now
aged 45 will be lost to business before they are 65 as a result of
critical illness, disability or death. A working man is three times more
likely to suffer long-term sickness or disability than to die before 65.
Every day 700 people in the UK are newly diagnosed as having cancer,
according to the Imperial Cancer Research Fund. Of those aged between 25
and 45, 60% of men and 63% of women will survive for five years or more.
Natural optimists will realise that nine out of ten men will not
suffer a heart attack before they are 65, and nine out of 10 executives
who are 45 will not be lost to business. If, however, you work in a firm
of 10 people or more, the odds are that you or one of your colleagues
will be affected.
If that person is essential to the company, the business itself -- and
his or her colleagues' jobs -- could be at risk. It may be that no one
is indispensable, but the time and cost of replacing someone at a
critical period may be too much for a business to withstand.
''In many cases you will find that businesses are driven by a small
number of persons,'' said Stewart Thomson, of Campbell Thomson
(Insurance Services) Ltd. ''They may be the directors or partners
themselves, or a key person.
''Companies and partnerships are very reliant on these persons, and if
death or serious illness occurred, there may be serious implications for
the business.
''If you change the words ''key person'' to read ''assets'' then the
first step has been taken to accepting and acknowledging the crucial
part these persons play in the business concerned. Without these assets
where would the development and drive be? Could the company sustain its
profits without them?''
Directors and partners do not hesitate to insure assets such as
machinery, cars and buildings. Insuring against the potential loss of a
key person dying or becoming seriously ill tends to meet with a
reluctance to consider the adverse effect of such a loss.
Many firms will have basic life cover in place but, as the statistics
quoted above show, serious illness is more probable than death during a
working lifetime.
''It should become apparent that companies and partnerships should
consider insuring against the loss of their main assets, ie the key
persons,'' said Thomson. ''The level of cover that needs to be provided
would depend on how important the key person is to the business.''
For example, in a small company with a key person who is responsible
for bringing in the majority of orders to a company, the directors would
need to quantify the profit attributable to him or her.
The amount insured for should cover the company against the loss of
orders and therefore the loss of profit. ''The lump sum provided by the
claim obviously softens the blow of the loss of the key person,'' said
Thomson.
There is no fixed formula for deciding on the sum assured, but it
would not normally exceed three times the average net profit over two
years that could be ascribed to that key person.
''An independent financial adviser would be able to discuss the
appropriate sum assured and also the tax implications of the particular
plan,'' he said.
There are different types of insurance policy which companies can opt
for, the main ones being term assurance, whole of life, critical illness
and permanent health insurance.
Term assurance is a relatively low-cost way to protect the company,
and in the event of the key person's death, the money is paid directly
to the company to use as it wishes. It is a protection-only plan for a
specified number of years with no surrender or maturity values.
Whole of life assurance provides death cover on a more permanent
basis. Unit-linked plans are flexible and an investment portion can be
built in to provide a reasonable cash value in the future if no claim
arises.
Critical illness cover is relatively new in the UK and pays out in the
event of a heart attack, cancer, coronary artery by-pass, major organ
transplants and strokes. It can also cover conditions such as multiple
sclerosis, motor neurone disease and additional ''non-core conditions''
for a slightly higher premium.
''This type of cover should be given serious consideration, and an IFA
will be able to assist in choosing the correct plan,'' said Thomson.
Keyman permanent health insurance differs from this in that the
company insures for a regular income payable to the company, usually for
a two-year period. This gives the company the time and money to
compensate against his or her loss.
Where the key people in a business are also the directors or partners,
there is an additional complication which should be protected against.
''Death and serious illness have no respect for cash flow, and you can
imagine the devastation that would be caused if a director or partner
died or had a stroke,'' said Thomson.
''What position would that leave his fellow directors or partners in?
Even if an agreement is in place, would the remaining directors or
partners want the heirs or family of the affected colleague to become
involved in the business?
Directors Share Protection or Partnership Assurance Plans are
practical and cost-effective ways of protecting against this kind of
dilemma. They allow the surviving directors or partners to buy their
affected colleague's interest or shareholding or to compensate
dependants.
In short, they exist to put money into the right hands at the right
time.
When setting up such plans, a limited company will have to look at its
Memoranda and Articles of Association, and partnerships at their
existing Partnership Agreement -- if indeed there is one -- to ensure
there is no conflict.
''Therefore it is important that the wider legal and taxation
implications of the business are considered, and IFAs would normally
wish to work in harness with the client's solicitor and accountant,''
said Thomson.
''It would be sound business practice seriously to consider the
safeguards to improve the long-term financial stability of the
business.''

Losing any crucial member of staff due to illness can affect
efficiency, morale and performance
IT is not only partners, directors or key personnel who are important
to keeping going a business and the jobs it creates. ''Managing a
successful business is a team game,'' said David Bates, of Cairns Horne
&amp; Co.
''Losing any crucial member of staff due to illness, especially
critical or terminal illness, for any length of time can affect the
efficiency, morale and performance of the team -- particularly in a
smaller business -- and can be costly if you have to meet salary
commitments in part or in whole for a few months, while paying overtime
to others to cover.''
Industry is estimated to lose around 350 million working days through
absence, mainly due to sickness, and both large and small companies are
affected.
In some areas, patients are having to wait longer for non-urgent
medical treatment on the NHS and some health authorities may refuse
certain treatments. Though the illnesses might not be life-threatening,
they can cause discomfort and reduce working efficiency.
''If someone can obtain treatment only from the NHS they can have to
take time off work while waiting to be seen,'' said Bates, ''or perhaps
be called in at very short notice to hospital for an operation at an
inconvenient or a crucial time.
''Private medical insurance on a group basis for selected or all
employees means many health problems can be tackled promptly and at a
date convenient to the business and the individual, thus minimising
disruption to the team.''
Even if there is such a scheme in place, it may not be the most
cost-effective. Other schemes, perhaps dealing with different staff
levels, might provide better cover for the same or less money.
''Perhaps of greater concern to the individual is the protection of
his income after any employer benefits cease or reduce if he is off ill
for a long period -- or for life, being unable to perform ''his own
occupation'' due to this sickness,'' he said.
''Here I really do suggest that an IFA can -- on behalf of the company
-- extend added value by counselling employees on their options.''
Pension provision for employees is the most important benefit, after
their salary, that an employer can provide. ''It is highly likely that
the ''funding rate'' will be approximately 16% of payroll, including
administrative costs, and that the employee has to contribute in the
region of 5-7% of salary.
''It is often the case, especially in these days of
performance-related pay, that another 25-100% of basic salary is
unpensioned. This also takes no account of profit-related pay, overtime
and the like, which are normally unpensionable.''
If these were all amalgamated on to an annual pension report, it would
enable the individual to see what he or she would need in additional
voluntary contributions to make up this shortfall.
''This demonstrates the need for each individual to seek out
independent advice regarding adequate retirement provision at an age of
his selection.''
The other main consideration for employers is the cost of running a
pension scheme, especially the administration and management time, as
the trustees are normally the directors of the company.
''It is fair to suggest that they would much rather spend precious
time running the business than their pension scheme. Many are reviewing
their current arrangements and investigating the merits of other
methods, for example Group Personal Pension Schemes.
''Employees can tailor these to suit their own needs. Different levels
can be provided for differing staff levels or individuals in line with
business needs.
''Perhaps one of the most saleable points of this sort of arrangement
to employees is that they really feel this sort of scheme ''belongs'' to
them. In effect, this means they can take it with them when they leave
the company, or they can convert it to an individual plan.
''This reduces any long-term administration to the employer. In simple
terms, there will be no ex-members for the employer to trace at their
retirement age.''

THIS month's TrailBlazer Award goes to Diagnostic Instruments, a
company founded eight years ago in West Lothian to produce highly
specialised equipment for the analysis of noise and vibration in
industrial and technical situations.
This accolade is yet one more to add to the string of awards
Diagnostic Instruments has received in its short life, and it coincides
with further confirmation of its successful and steady expansion in a
very competitive field. This is the final implementation of a two-year
DTI funded project, a joint venture with Rolls-Royce, Glasgow's
Caledonian University and Black and Decker, as main contractor to
produce a completely new noise quality meter.
This noise and vibration equipment, which won a SMART Award in August
this year, has been designed with built-in software sophisticated enough
to identify the precise degree of noise and vibration emitted by newly
manufactured drills. Amazingly, until now it had been left to the
subjective human ear to judge these.
The production of this new quality meter means Diagnostic Instruments
can expand from its present two markets into a completely new third
area, consolidating its steady growth -- its turnover is now #2.2m.
Since the company's establishment in 1987 in Whitburn, its managing
director Matt Snodgrass has provided imaginative leadership. It has
grown from a one-product outfit to one with a wide range of portable FFT
analysers, data collectors for predictive maintenance and bearing
analysers, each appropriate in a variety of situations and environments.
Diagnostic Instruments now employs 33 people -- most of them graduates
-- and has moved to spanking new premises in Livingston. The manufacture
of all its products is sub-contracted to an engineering company in
Glenrothes.
Snodgrass was formerly marketing manager for the hi-tech engineering
company Burr Brown. In 1987 he left to develop a portable analyser which
could be used for everything from checking the density of concrete,
measuring the vibration of pylons and tuning bagpipes to assessing leaks
in water pipes, and with a colleague he set up Diagnostic Instruments to
produce it. The analyser was sold worldwide to a sophisticated
engineering niche market.
From the beginning, Snodgrass recognised the importance of listening
to customers and adapting his product. When he saw there was a need for
predictive maintenance equipment to monitor machinery by measuring its
vibration, he developed a new instrument with different software. He
launched this in 1989 and sold it so successfully it became the UK
market leader.
Since then, there have been continuous improvements and adaptations of
both instruments, and the volume of sales worldwide has grown steadily.
In 1992 a new safe instrument was launched. This innovative product
made hot work permits unnecessary for the majority of operations and was
the first of its kind to win CENELEC approval. The following year
Diagnostic Instruments signed a $1m-plus contract with Chinese firm
TEIC.
In 1994, in response to customer need, it launched what it considers
the best data collector in the world, a sophisticated, rugged and easily
used product which is selling extremely well. And this year it won a
prestigious contract from the MoD to supply #300,000 of predictive
equipment for the navy.
Diagnostic Instrument's steady growth has not come about by accident.
Its success, despite stiff international competition, is the result of
intelligent, well organised management. John Ker of Ernst &amp; Young was
particularly impressed by the company's commitment to consumer care,
attention to customer needs and willingness to respond imaginatively to
them.
Equally important is the open, team spirit which pervades the company.
Every individual knows what its aims are and is energetic and
co-operative in achieving them. Also, the company maintains close
control over finance, formulating detailed plans and monitoring them
rigorously to ensure its continued growth and profitability.

WHAT is required is ''out-of-the-box thinking. We needto ask the
unaskable''. The words -- with their strong whiff of Tom Peters -- come
from a determined and entrepreneurial Scot who once worked in the
airline business but, for the past 13 years, has been selling metal to
manufacturers servicing the global oil industry.
But Malcolm Howat's prescription is not just a me-too echo of the
stage challenges sprayed out by one of America's leading management
gurus. Howat and his long-time colleague, John Ferguson, practise
exactly that in a business where, if you remain an arms-length
stockholder or a jobbing machine shop, the daily challenge is margin,
margin, margin.
The oil industry has shown itself receptive to radical new
relationships at other stages of the production process. Contractors,
such as the Wood Group, have taken over the running of whole offshore
platforms. Shell Expro in Aberdeen sub-contracted its entire finance
function to Andersen Consulting.
But forging meaningful partnerships at the front end -- supplying
nickel alloy and duplex steels, often in semi-finished form, to the
companies which make wellheads, pumps, valves and other subsea equipment
-- means taking pioneering steps away from the separate box
traditionally occupied by metal stockholders or machining shops.
The challenge is to get customers to sign up for the idea that both
sides have an investment in gaining a competitive advantage for the
products into which the steel will eventually be turned.
Cumbernauld-based Howat's approach is to offer two things. The right
metal, supplied on shorter lead times, at a reduced total cost. And
unprecedented intimate access to his company's inventory, pricing and
technical resource, so that trust is established and the usual
paperchase eliminated.
And that is exactly what Howco Metal Management Group, as it recently
renamed itself, is now doing with its key oil industry customers,
notably Baker Oil Tools, with whom it has a global supply agreement.
Headquarters is Cumbernauld's Blairlinn Estate, where there's a 50,000
sq ft plant and a 200,000 sq ft stockyard. In the early nineties Howco
also opened a forged products subsidiary in Barnsley.
Howco Metals Inc, the American subsidiary, is now based inside a Baker
Hughes plant in Houston, the strategic heartland of global offshore
engineering. But the relationship is not of the captive supplier
variety. Howco can, and does, trade its inventory there with other
distributors. ''It's not doing them or us any good having it sitting on
the racks,'' says Howat.
This radical reworking of the traditional arms-length supply chain is
clearly working for Howco. Turnover has nearly doubled to #16.5m this
year. Profits have risen in line. ''And the beauty is that our core
business becomes not just another supplier but a deceptively complex
thing which we can take anywhere in the world,'' he adds.
Exports reached #3.5m in the past year, with inventory held in
Singapore to exploit the burgeoning Pacific Basin fields and metal sold
from Australia to the Gulf and right across Europe. ''The target for
1996 is #7m,'' he says.
Five years ago Howco wasn't even a serious player in the oil sector.
From its start in Kilsyth in 1982, in the teeth of one recession, it was
primarily a supplier to the defence industry. One speciality was tube
for the submarine periscopes made by Barr &amp; Stroud.
There was early success, a string of business awards and a pat on the
back from Margaret Thatcher, who once approvingly dubbed Howat and
Ferguson ''entrepreneurs with their jackets off''.
But the peace dividend delivered no plaudits, as far as Howco was
concerned. As customers like Barr &amp; Stroud retrenched and embarked on
their own restructuring, and another recession started to bite, Howco
had to find a fresh focus.
Howat and Ferguson, who still own 100% of the equity between them,
started thinking out of the box again and realised that some of the more
exotic nickel alloy steels they had been supplying to defence
contractors could have applications in the oil industry, as the majors
tried to tap reserves in deeper, more testing and corrosive
environments.
''They were processing bar, when every piece of downhole equipment has
a hole in it. We asked them why they didn't use tube and they told us it
simply wasn't available to them,'' says Howat, pointing out that at
least one Japanese tube mill is already fully committed until the end of
1996.
A second problem was the cost of higher grade steels, in an industry
where oil prices were tumbling, in real terms, to pre-1974 levels. ''We
realised the potential, if we could make the supplies competitive.''
So they worked with steel melters to see if such grades could be
produced commercially. At Cumbernauld Howco can add to the properties of
these steels -- bought judiciously up to a year ahead, to avoid the
disruptions speculators occasionally trigger in the market -- by high
temperature treatment.
Every item is bar coded and the entire inventory computerised. On-site
laboratory facilities ensure that all there is to be known about every
piece of metal is logged in the database.
Giving partner customers, like Baker, access to that system short
circuits a whole series of stages in the buying process. Howat reckons
that, with oil now accounting for 80% of turnover, up to 35% of total
sales go to customers with whom Howco has partnership agreements.
''It's a leap of faith on both sides. But it's proving to be a dynamic
process. In America, in particular, it's creating tremendous
opportunities to grow.''

<TEXT>
* I retired recently at the age of 60 and, after taking account of my
redundancy money, I have about #52,000 at my disposal. My monthly
pension amounts to #850 after tax, but my financial needs, estimated at
#1100 a month, are greater than this, largely because my #37,000
mortgage does not mature until March 1998. This will be redeemed by
three endowment policies with Scottish life offices, which I estimate
will produce about #65,000 at maturity. I am single with no dependents.
I would appreciate your advice on how best to invest my savings and on
the possibility of using my redundancy money to repay my mortgage. My
house is worth about #80,000.
* Your financial situation is a little tight in the short run, largely
because the taxation of the income from your savings would make it
difficult for you to produce a sufficient return to meet the shortfall
in your monthly income.
But after March 1998 your position will improve dramatically since you
will have a substantial surplus from your endowment policies after
repaying your mortgage. Your income shortfall will disappear and you
will be able to use the income from your savings to enjoy life and
provide yourself with a nest egg for the future.
Moreover, in five years you have a state pension due to supplement
your regular income. In the circumstances, it would make sense to use
some of your current funds to bridge your income gap meantime. You
should also give serious consideration to repaying part, or even all, of
your mortgage. There is no point in having a debt of more than #30,000,
the ceiling for mortgage interest tax relief, when you have the
resources to reduce it.
There are many ways of skinning a cat, but might we suggest that the
following dispositions would be appropriate? Use #17,000 to reduce your
mortgage to #20,000. This would sharply lower your monthly payments. A
further #15,000 could be deposited in a high income building society
account, and you could make withdrawals from this as needed to
supplement your income.
The balance of #20,000 should be spent on a small portfolio of
investment and unit trusts to provide long-term capital growth and a
modest income.
Looking ahead to 1998, you should have around #45,000 of additional
funds available for long-term investment from the surplus on your
endowments. At that stage you might also decide that some of your
building society funds could be released for investment.
You would then be in a position to expand your portfolio to include
some equities. In the meantime, it would be a good idea to discuss these
matters with a stockbroker and/or independent financial adviser in order
to come up with some specific proposals for investment.
Whatever you decide, you should not be concerned about your financial
position, as it is clear that any problems you have are essentially of a
short-term nature and you have the resources to overcome them.
The above figures are for illustrative purposes and you may well come
up with something a little more appropriate to your precise
circumstances. But the three-way split in your immediately available
funds is worth your serious consideration.
* I have reached the age where it is unlikely that I will be realising
any of my shareholdings. My portfolio has been built up over a large
number of years and will eventually be passed on to my children.
Is it, therefore, worthwhile doing bed and breakfast transactions to
take advantage of the annual capital gains exemption bearing in mind the
commission taken by stockbrokers? I realise the annual exemption will be
lost if not used before April 5, but surely there is no point incurring
expenses if I do not intend to sell my shares?
* The purpose of bed and breakfast transactions is to increase the
cost of the shareholdings for capital gains purposes so that there is a
reduced gain on the ultimate disposal of the shares. There is no point
in these transactions if you do not intend to dispose of the holdings
during your lifetime, as there is no capital gains liability on death
and your beneficiaries inherit at the market value at that time.
You could, however, still make use of the annual capital gains
exemption by gifting some shares now to your children, and this has the
added advantage of reducing or eliminating any potential inheritance tax
liability on the value of these holdings. The level of transfer is
obviously determined by the amount of gains which will be realised, but
you should also take into account the effect this will have on your
income.
The gifts should be made prior to April 5 to take advantage of this
year's capital gains exemption, and the stock transfer forms should,
therefore, be completed and signed before that date.
* I am a lecturer in teacher education and am in the teacher's
superannuation scheme. I am considering taking out AVCs with the
Prudential as recommended by my professional association. However, a
colleague who took out AVCs claims that these were taken into account to
her disadvantage when she recently received early retirement. Is the
Prudential the best company for teachers and is my colleague's case
normal practice?
* AVCs can be very good value for enhancing a pension entitlement.
However, the Inland Revenue does set certain limits on the amount of
pension allowable. If AVCs were to take the pension above those limits
and the scheme is overfunded in this way, any over-provision is returned
to the scheme member subject to a tax charge.
In the case of your colleague, we do not know the exact circumstances
but normally AVCs should be monitored and assessed to see that the
limits are not exceeded. An annuity purchased on the proceeds of AVCs
would probably not be as favourable as the normal superannuation scheme
especially if this is index-linked. It is essental that the length of
service and the amount payed into AVCs are assessed. The Prudential,
which is a leader in its field, should be able to offer guidance on this
score.
* Is there a time limit on a husband and wife electing to have income
from joint assets split in unequal proportions, and does the election
apply to all jointly held assets?
* The declaration you refer to must be made on the Inland Revenue form
17 which requests a list of the assets to be covered by the declaration
and this only applies to the assets on the list. The form is available
from tax offices and must be signed and dated by both husband and wife
and can be sent to either of their tax districts. The income from the
assets listed is taxed in accordance with the declaration from the date
it is signed, provided the notification reaches the Inspector within 60
days of that date. Once made the declaration cannot be withdrawn.
Income from assets held in joint names will normally be split equally
for tax purposes and only where the beneficial interest in the asset and
the income from it are unequal can a declaration be made. This means
that where a couple invest unequal amounts of capital, they can request
that the income arising is assessed in proportion. The declaration does
not apply to joint bank or building society accounts, the income from
which will always be taxed on a 50-50 basis.
* I have read recently about the possibility of an employee making
additional voluntary contributions to either the employer's pension
scheme or to a scheme of your own choice. Can you say what the limit is
for these additional payments, and if they have not been made in earlier
years is it possible to catch up by making extra payments this year?
* A person in pensionable employment is allowed to obtain tax relief
on contributions of up to 15% of earnings subject to a maximum earnings
limit which is currently #78,600. The total of normal annual
contributions plus additional voluntary contributions (AVCs) must not
exceed the 15% limit. For example if your employer's scheme is
contributory and you normally pay 5% of salary, you may make AVCs of up
to 10% of earnings either to your employer's scheme or to a
free-standing AVC plan. For this purpose earnings usually include
salary, bonus, commission and the value of taxable benefits in kind.
Unlike retirement annuity contracts and personal pension plans for the
self-employed and individuals not in pensionable employment, it is not
possible to obtain tax relief for unused limits for earlier years. Nor
is it possible to relate premiums back to an earlier year.

In the swim of
modernisation
QUANTITY surveying firm Thomas &amp; Adamson is currently involved in
modernising the Dollan Baths in East Kilbride, one of only two
Olympic-sized swimming pools in Scotland.
The company should have no problem tackling this job as senior partner
Frank Thomas is a former Scottish swimming champion, having won the
Scottish men's 220-yards freestyle at the Bon Accord baths in Aberdeen
in 1958.
Thomas went on to coach David Wilkie and helped him to win his Olympic
silver medal. Not only that but 10 of the 21 Scots swimmers who took
part in the 1970 Commonwealth Games were his proteges.
He gave up coaching in 1972 and his interest in swimming pools is now
purely professional, but at least he knows what the customers want.
Beware crooks
offering gifts
THE Nigerian scam which has plagued so many companies in this country
is continuing.
Among the latest recipients of the unwanted attentions is Martin
Reid-Foster who received a letter addressed to his public relations
consultancy in Helensburgh. It asked permission to ''remit $30,000,000
USD in your company or private account''.
The sender claimed to be an accountant with the Nigerian National
Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) in Lagos and said the money was for a
contract which had been completed some time ago. Reid-Foster told
Business Diary: ''The letter asked for my bank details and copies of my
company's headed notepaper.''
The letter is intended to imply that you are being used as a vehicle
to launder money -- it states that the sender expects to get 60% of the
money back and that you can keep 30% for allowing use of your account,
while the other 10% is eaten up by expenses.
Part of it reads: ''I personally want to believe that you are honest
enough and would not sit on the money if finally gotten into your
account . . . We would not like you to publicise it for our own safety
too, hence it requires a high level of confidence and secrecy.''
The real purpose of the letter is, of course, to obtain details of a
person's bank account. Reid-Foster spotted the scam immediately and
contacted Glasgow Chamber of Commerce. The chamber said it continued to
receive reports of this type of approach emanating from Nigeria.
The Nigerian desk of the DTI commented: ''Despite previous widespread
publicity companies and individuals are falling victim to this type of
fraud and losing substantial sums from their accounts.''
Anyone who receives such an approach should contact the Nigeria desk
on 0171 215 2844 and fax it a copy of the document on 0171 215 8618.
Thoughts on the
environment
HEINZ Rothermund, managing director of Shell Exploration and
Production, is this year's speaker at the celebrity lecture in the
Senate Suite of the University of Strathclyde on October 26.
The subject of his talk is ''A Commitment to Improve Health, Safety
and the Environment in the Offshore Oil and Gas Industry''.
No doubt the audience at the lecture, which is organised by the West
of Scotland branch of the Institute of Petroleum, will be interested to
hear what he has to say on the subject following Shell's controversial
proposal to dump the Brent Spar platform in the North Sea.
He is unlikely to allow the occasion to pass without some reference to
the conflict between Greenpeace and Shell which eventually led the
company to abandon its plans to dump the platform at sea.
Walking over
the sea to Skye
ACCOUNTANT Douglas Kenney will be going across the sea to Skye today
on foot. He will be among the first to walk over from the mainland
during a special charity day at the Skye Bridge before it opens to
traffic.
Numerous walkers will be taking the opportunity to cover the
three-and-a-half mile span to raise funds for their nominated charities.
Kenney will be walking on behalf of his neice, Emily, and other children
with cerebral palsy.
The cash he raises will be going towards the new Scottish Bobath
Centre for the treatment of cerebral palsy due to open in Glasgow on
December 1. If you would like to contribute, you can send a cheque, made
out to the Scottish Bobath Association, to him at 9 Viewfield Drive,
Bishopbriggs, Glasgow G64 2AQ.
Mixing business
with pleasure
COMEDIAN Johnny Beattie topped the bill when Monkland Business Forum
kicked off its new session earlier this week. More than 100 local
business people attended the forum, which is normally held on the last
Monday of the month in the Tudor Hotel, Airdrie.
Last year it started its dinner season with comedian Andy Cameron, so
the companies in North Lanarkshire obviously like to mix business with
pleasure. Chairwoman Louise Stewart told Business Diary: ''We always try
to keep the forum enjoyable, light hearted and informative. Who knows?
Next year's first speaker could be Billy Connolly.''
Another dinner which should be entertaining is the third annual
Gentlemen's Dinner of the Ayrshire Hospice next Friday in the Belleisle
House Hotel, Ayr.
Comedian Norman Collier is the guest speaker and he will be joined by
Rev Howard Haslet and former FIFA referee Brian McGinlay. Construction
company Robison and Davidson is sponsoring the evening, and among the
raffle prizes are a champagne lunch at the Rangers v Celtic game in
November and a VIP day out at Old Trafford.
Anyone -- of either sex -- interested in going along should contact
Jim Brodie on 01292 288488.
Artful way to aid
Prince's Trust
A NEW national competition, Business Rewards, was launched earlier
this week to mark the tenth anniversary of The Prince's Youth Business
Trust founded by The Prince of Wales and followed, in 1989, by the
Prince's Scottish Youth Business Trust.
The combined turnover of PSYBT supported businesses now exceeds #40m,
and it is this kind of success rate which has led accountant Arthur
Andersen to support the competition.
The trust is also receiving help from another direction which I am
sure will interest Eric Hagman, Arthur Andersen's UK managing partner.
The private art collection of Falkirk businessman John Rae, together
with a selling exhibition of new art from young Scottish painters, is
now on at the Smith Art Gallery &amp; Museum in Stirling. Commission from
the sales will go to PSYBT funds.
Hagman, who is a keen art collector in his own right, as well as being
responsible for purchasing many of the fine works on display in Arthur
Andersen offices, may well be tempted to pop in.

Round-the-clock
banking service
FROM Monday Robert Fleming and Save &amp; Prosper start a 24-hour,
seven-day-a-week banking service. At any time of day or night, clients
will have direct telephone access to staff who will answer questions
about their accounts, including current balances, statements and whether
cheques have been debited or deposits cleared.
They will also be able to undertake a wide range of transaction
including transfers between accounts, stopping cheques, paying bills and
ordering statements.
The service is built around the Premier Account for those able to keep
higher-than-average balances. It is available to those with annual
income of #25,000 and above, and equity in the home or other assets to
the value of #25,000.
Trust in Asia
A NEW investment trust is being launched by Abtrust Fund Managers,
part of Aberdeen Trust. Abtrust Fund Managers (Singapore) will be the
manager to the trust, which will aim to maximise total return over the
long term from a portfolio of smaller quoted companies in Asia,
excluding Japan.
It is to be launched through an institutional placing sponsored by
Panmure Gordon. Dealings are expected to start in mid October.
Pension plan
A FLEXIBLE, transparent and low-cost personal pension plan -- the
Pension Investment Plan (PIP) -- is being launched by Partridge Muir &amp;
Warren, designer of specialist financial products.
It says PIP differs from other recently launched low-cost schemes
because the performance of the fund will be continually monitored and
the managers will be changed if it does not meet recognised benchmarks.
This, it says, ''effectively gives private investors the same power as
institutional pension funds''.
The Schroders Managed Fund which invests in international equities,
bonds, cash and property has been selected as the major fund.
Gilt fund offer
CONFEDERATION Pensions Investment, the pensions investment arm of Sun
Life of Canada, has introduced a new long-term gilt fund ''in response
to the needs of institutional investors who recognise long-term gilts as
a means of protecting funds' annuity purchasing power''.
Medical benefits
A LOW-cost medical expenses insurance has been launched by Manchester
Unity Friendly Society. It provides cash benefits to offset everyday
medical costs from 18p a day. The scheme -- Manchester Unity Healthcare
-- pays out for hospital in-patient stays, optical treatment (including
spectacles and contact lenses), dental treatment (including check-ups),
physiotherapy, osteopathy, chiropractic treatment, specialist and
consultant fees, and psychiatric in-patient stays.
If both parents are members, or if it is a single parent family,
children are covered free. The plan is designed for use alongside any
other insurance such as private health, or income protection. The more
units purchased, the higher the benefits, up to a maximum weekly
contribution of #3.54. No medical checks are required to join, and it is
open to anyone between 16 and 64.
Fixed-term bond
NEWCASTLE Building Society is to launch a new fixed-term investment
bond, Nova Growth Bond, on Monday, guaranteeing interest up to October
31, 1999. Interest will rise on November 1 each year starting in 1996.
The gross annual rate in year one is 6.75% (6.50% monthly) rising to 7%
(6.75%) in year two, 7.50% (7.25%) in year three, and 8.25% (8%) in year
four.
Minimum initial investment is #1000, or #5000 for monthly interest.
Additional investments can be made while the issue remains current.
Immediate withdrawals are allowed subject to the loss of 90 days
interest.
Regular return
GLASGOW-based fund management house Murray Johnstone is now promoting
its Murray Monthly Income Selector Plan direct to the public. The plan
gives investors seeking a level of income between 1% and 9% a year
access to three well-known equity funds -- Murray International Trust,
Murray Income Trust (both investment trusts) and unit trust Murray
Equity Income Fund, all of which are managed by Murray Johnstone. Each
has a target of producing rising income and capital growth from
predominantly equity-based investments.
This is the only plan in investment trusts and unit trusts to have
been combined to provide income in this way. Minimum investment is
#10,000 and 90% of this will be divided equally between the three funds.
The rest will be invested in an interest earning cash ''buffer''
account.
High interest
LLOYDS Bank has launched a high interest fund unit trust, offering an
estimated yield on launch of 7% to 7.5% with a minimum single
subscription of #1000 or monthly payments of at least #50. The fund
invests in corporate bonds and other fixed securities and will be looked
after by the managers of the UK's largest sterling fixed-interest fund
-- Lloyds Investment Managers. Customers can get into the fund via
Lloyds Bank's unit trust PEPs.
Venture trust
BARONSMEAD, the development capital house which has just been acquired
by Ivory &amp; Sime, has launched the first public offering of Venture
Capital Trust which is being offered to subscribers until November 6,
with shares expected to be traded on the Stock Exchange on November 13.
The objective is to achieve steady, long-term growth and to pay
attractive dividends by investing in approximately 30 established UK
companies across a range of industrial sectors and geographic regions.
Companies whose shares are traded on the Alternative Investment Market
also qualify.
Minimum investment is #2500 with additional investment in multiples of
#100. Initial charge is 5% (of which 3% is payable to authorised
intermediaries), and the annual fee is expected to be approximately 2.6%
but is capped at 3.5%.

EVEN in these days of growing financial sophistication -- and
complication it should be said -- many people are blissfully ignorant
about the various types of investment once they get out of the narrow
confines of National Savings and building societies.
Blissfully because for many, and not just the elderly, simplicity is
essential -- and investment can be far from simple for the uninitiated.
Trying to pick a personal equity plan (PEP) or recommend one, for
example, can be a nightmare for the ordinary person and even the
so-called experts. There are so many, taking so many different forms and
with different levels of risk.
Of the equity forms of investment probably unit trusts, which can also
be used in PEPs, have made the biggest inroads into the consciousness of
the nation. But even the campaign to increase private share ownership
cannot be said to have been a great success. Privatisations certainly
increased the number of small shareholders but mostly they failed to
encourage them to extend their range beyond this.
Next in line after unit trusts come investment trusts. These are still
well behind in terms of public awareness, though perhaps not as much in
Scotland where they have played a more important role for some time.
Investment trust originator Foreign &amp; Colonial has now issued a free
guide to the Essentials of Investment Trusts, designed to take the
mystery out of the jargon and provide a step-by-step explanation of the
both the advantages and the risks of this kind of investment. It is not
the first such guide and it will certainly not be the last, but whether
publications of this sort actually make any impact is a moot point. One
is inclined to think they are mostly read by the already converted.
Foreign &amp; Colonial itself says these trusts are one of the best kept
investment secrets. The performance of investment trusts, which can also
be used in PEPs, pensions and savings plans, generally compares very
well with that of unit trusts over reasonable periods of time.
Like unit trusts, they offer the chance to spread the risk, to benefit
from the experience and expertise of an investment management company,
and a chance to take advantage of low cost way of investing.
Investment trusts, unlike unit trusts, are quoted on the Stock
Exchange as investment companies. A single investment into an investment
trust means the money can be spread over as many as 200 companies. And
where the trust invests in several different stock markets, the spread
of risk can be extended to cover different currencies as well.
However, it is the discount or premium on an investment trust that can
cause the most puzzlement. So far as the straightforward share price is
concerned there is no problem. It is the price quoted by the stock
market and is determined by supply and demand. However, another method
of calculating the value of the trust is by adding up the individual
assets and deducting the liabilities to give the net asset value (nav).
The difference between this and the share price is referred to as a
premium or discount, depending upon whether it is below or above. The
majority of trusts stand at a discount.
This only becomes really important if a trust has a fixed life with a
pre-determined date at which the shareholders will decide whether to
wind it up and distribute assets or to continue for a further period.
The average investment trust investor will be primarily concerned with
the price the shares were bought at, and the income they offer.
As with all forms of equity investment, a judgment has to be made
about what is required: capital growth, income, or a combination of
both. And the risk factors will have to be considered. There is simply
no way potential investors can avoid this, except by letting a
professional do it for them and there is always a cost for this whatever
form it takes.

Robert J. Barclay, engineer and former director of John Brown and Co;
born July 21, 1906, died September 16, 1995
ROBERT J Barclay, a former vice-chairman of John Brown's shipyard at
Clydebank, and one of the foremost engineers of his day, has died in a
nursing home in Henley-on-Thames at the age of 89. The eldest son of a
distinguished Glasgow family of lawyers, he chose, to their surprise, to
become an engineer instead of entering the family business.
Educated at Repton School and Pembroke College, Cambridge, the young
Barclay gained an honours degree in the Mechanical Sciences Tripos. He
rowed for his college, took pleasure in walking the Scottish hills,
fished and stalked with both rifle and camera, and sailed his yacht
Venture on the west coast of Scotland.
On graduating he chose a craft-based apprenticeship at the Beardmore
shipyard on the Clyde -- not a sociably fashionable choice but a shrewd
one -- and completed his training at a German diesel engine works in
Mannheim, known more for its engine shop than for its shipbuilding.
While there he acquired German and a taste for Rhine wines.
Robert Barclay's first job was as a superintendent at English
Electric, Stafford. His reliability and fastidious attention to detail
were acknowledged in 1938 when he became general manager of Markham and
Co, Chesterfield, and subsequently the youngest ever managing director
of the heavy engineering firm, whose work would be important to the war
effort.
During the Second World War Markham made the extrusion presses vital
to aircraft production, heavy machine tools for armour, and
mini-submarines. The firm was also involved in the creation of a great
variety of heavy engineering equipment. This included ''Boving'' water
turbines for world markets, notably for the hydro-electric schemes at
Cruachan, Argyll (where they are still going strong 30 years later),
Kariba on the Zambezi, and at Owen Falls on the Victoria Nile.
Robert Barclay was also concerned with the production of satellite
dishes, wind tunnels, and -- a particular triumph for his singe-minded
dedication -- the first nuclear reactor onload refuelling machine.
His management style and working hours could be eccentric and trying,
as also his untidyness and love of hoarding. At one time he had several
years' stocks of the Glasgow Herald, Financial Times, and Spectator,
mostly unread. At the same time, he kept in close contact with his
skilled workforce and was concerned for their welfare, whether they were
active or retired.
Markham was owned by John Brown and Co. Robert Barclay was promoted to
the board to take wider responsibilities, which included travel to
Scandinavia, the US, Canada, and Africa. He was closely involved in the
Foster Wheeler John Brown partnership with its major share in the
Central Electricity Generating Board's large boilers, including those at
Eggborough and Longannet.
For more than 30 years, Robert Barclay's personal base was a hotel in
Baslow, Derbyshire, where he was able to pursue his hobby of bee-keeping
in a local paddock. Even after his retirement in 1976, he served on the
Chesterfield Hospital Board and was also a JP, acting as chairman of the
bench for many years.
Sir Eric Mensforth paid tribute to his former colleague and friend of
almost seven decades at his funeral at Clydebank yesterday. ''A
bachelor, he was understanding, affectionate, and generous to the
young,'' he said, and ''an outstanding, meticulous, and utterly reliable
engineer.''
It was in 1969 that Mr Barclay became vice-chairman of John Brown's of
Clydebank, succeeding Dr John Brown, the man who had started designing
the Queen Mary in 1926. ''Robert Barclay was a very fine engineer
indeed,'' said Dr Brown yesterday.
His brother David is a Glasgow lawyer.

Michael Leonard Graham Balfour, historian; born, Oxford, November 22,
1908, died Witney, September 16, 1995
FORMER Professor of European History at the University of East Anglia
and a leading expert on Second World War black propaganda, Michael
Balfour came from a Scottish writing family.
His father, Graham Balfour, was the first biographer of Robert Louis
Stevenson, and his grandmother, a Balfour of Pilrig, was a relation of
RLS.
Educated at Rugby, he read Greats at Balliol College, Oxford, and then
history. He graduated with first class honours and taught at various
Oxford colleges before going to Chatham House, the Royal Institute of
International Affairs, as secretary to a study group on nationalism.
He visited Germany for the first time in 1930 and a deep interest in
German affairs was born. He became a close friend of Graf Helmuth von
Moltke, who was arrested by the Nazis in 1941 and executed four years
later, and his friendship with von Moltke's widow led to his
collaboration with Julian Frisby on the book, Helmuth von Moltke: a
leader against Hitler, published in 1972.
Like many other brilliant academics he was recruited by the Ministry
of Information on the outbreak of the Second World War, and in due
course found his natural home in the Political Intelligence Department
of the Foreign Office, which was based in the stable wing at Woburn
Abbey.
Known as the Political Warfare Executive (PWE) it was responsible for
propaganda directed at the enemy, some through the BBC's foreign
language broadcasts, as well as phoney transmissions of alleged German
radio programmes designed to spread disruptive news to the enemy
population.
The PWE also wrote misleading leaflets, supplied newspapers with false
information, and spread rumours aimed at damaging morale and the enemy
war effort. His colleagues included Richard Crossman, later a Labour
Cabinet Minister and editor of the New Statesman, and Sefton Delmer, the
journalist and writer on espionage.
After the liberation of Paris he joined the Psychological Warfare
Division of the Supreme Headquarters of the Allied Expeditionary Force,
and in 1946 moved to the Control Commission in the British Zone of
occupied Germany as director in charge of supervising the German
information media. Ten years later he used this experience as the basis
for another book, Four-Power Control in Germany and Austria 1945-46.
In 1947 he returned to Britain and became chief information officer at
the Board of Trade, being appointed CBE in 1963. But the lure of
academic life was proving irresistible and in 1966 he went to the new
University of East Anglia as Professor of Modern History.
Among his nine books on modern history are The Kaiser and His Times
(1964), Britain and Joseph Chamberlain (1985), and Withstanding Hitler
in Germany 1933-45 (1988). He retired in 1974, but continued to speak at
international conferences and seminars on political warfare.
He is survived by his widow, Grizel Wilson, whom he married in 1934,
and their three daughters.

William McIntosh Millar, OBE, commercial lawyer and music-lover; born
September 10, 1925, died September 19, 1995
WILLIAM McIntosh Millar, a well-known figure in commercial law and
music and drama circles in the West of Scotland, has died. He was 70.
Educated at Glasgow Academy, Fettes College, and Glasgow University,
he worked for many years as a senior partner with Glasgow-based
solicitors, McClure, Naismith, Anderson &amp; Gardiner, where he became a
very highly regarded commercial property lawyer.
Mr Millar served as chairman of the Strathclyde group of Voluntary
Housing Societies and was awarded the OBE in the Queen's Birthday
Honours list in 1971 for his services to co-operative housing in the
West of Scotland. In 1989 he received a special presentation in
recognition of the six years he spent as editor of the Journal of the
Law Society of Scotland.
In leisure moments away from his involvement in commercial law, he
enjoyed playing the violin and in his later years aspired to play the
bagpipes. He also had senior roles with the Citizens' Theatre and the
former Close Theatre Club and Glasgow Chamber Orchestra.
He was chairman of the Scottish Early Music Consort till his
retirement and was also the leader of an amateur string quartet. In this
last capacity he remarked memorably to one professional player who had
been coaching them: ''Well, it might sound awful to you but we hear
Beethoven.''
His love of music and theatre was reflected in his serving for more
than 20 years as a governor of the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and
Drama. In March this year he was made a fellow of the academy in
recognition of his services, an honour which close friends say he
greatly cherished.
For many years Mr Millar was chairman of the staff committee and
closely involved in negotiating conditions of service. Robert Inglis,
concerts organiser at the academy, recalls that the staff found him ''an
extraordinarily civilised chairman.''
After his retirement in 1988, Mr Millar moved to the Isle of Lewis,
where he died last week. He is survived by his wife Hazel, three sons
and two daughters.

Olive Gibbs, peace campaigner, Lord Mayor of Oxford, and city
councillor; born Oxford, February 17, 1918, died Oxford, September 28,
1995
OLIVE GIBBS, a life-long pacifist and feisty campaigner against
nuclear weapons, helped found CND in 1958, taking over the national
chair in 1964 in succession to Canon John Collins.
Born Olive Cox, she had an unhappy childhood in one of the poorest
areas of Oxford and was frequently beaten by her father. As a
consequence she abhorred violence of any kind. She was deeply
traumatised by the dropping of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and
Nagasaki and had no hesitation in taking the lead to form the Oxford
group of CND.
Never parochial in her outlook, she came to national attention in 1959
when she attacked a pamplet published by the Women's Voluntary Service,
then a subservient establishment body. She was understandably furious
with one particular phrase: ''Radiation sickness is a kind of nasty
tummy ache.''
Her anger stemmed not only from her pacifist convictions, but also her
great concern for honesty, and her scorn for women who were prepared to
indulge in such ludicrous propaganda.
It was through CND that she became a close friend of Michael Foot,
declaring in her autobiography Our Olive (that was how she was widely
known in Oxford) that they shared just about everything except sleeping
bags on the numerous Aldermaston protest marches in the sixties and
seventies.
Her involvement with local politics began in 1952 in a successful
defence of nursery schools treatened with closure by the Tory-dominated
city council and she was herself elected councillor the following year.
Olive Gibbs was a prominent and popular figure in the Labour Party,
but she was always to be a controversial guardian of socialism. Her
independent nature ensured she would not necessarily toe the party line.
While she could be counted upon to support every left-wing cause,
Olive Gibbs was to become one of the city's most popular Lord Mayors,
serving in that post for two terms. In her latter years she battled
against cancer and retired from the council in 1985.

Professor Sir Grahame Clark, archaeologist and prehistorian; born July
28, 1907, died September 12, 1995
IT is quite common for ex-students, in later life, to remember their
professors with affection and some degree of awe, this being part -- one
hopes -- of the natural tribute paid by the younger generation to the
older which taught it.
Nevertheless there can be few among the one-time Cambridge
undergraduates who studied under Grahame Clark, who later went on to
make archaeology their careers, and are now scattered all over the world
who will not agree that with his death, at the age of 88, a great era in
the study of man's prehistory has come to an end.
This subject -- the enormous span of time before written records -- is
a curious one, half science and half humanity. The scientific part can
tell us about the vanished technologies but virtually nothing about the
living peoples who employed them, or about their customs and languages.
Arguments from analogy, inevitably lacking in certainty, have to be
employed to reconstruct these but this is not always clearly recognised.
It is all too easy to pretend to a certainty about the past which the
evidence can never allow, or even to believe -- as some do now -- that
all will be revealed if only the correct theoretical approach (the
origins of which can be obscure) is followed.
Throughout his entire career, spent at Peterhouse College, Cambridge,
and teaching in the Department of Archaeology and Anthropology, Grahame
Clark demonstrated that only the highest and most rigorous standards of
collecting and interpreting archaeological evidence were acceptable.
When he started in the 1930s British archaeology did not make very
much use of the natural sciences. Clark had begun his work fairly
traditionally on the relatively unglamorous flints of the Mesolithic
period, the time of the hunter-gatherers who lived in the forests of
Europe after the end of the last Ice Age.
However, his exploration of the waterlogged hunters' camp at Starr
Carr in Yorkshire in the late 1940s marked the advent of that
multi-disciplinary archaeology which is now regarded as the norm, and in
which specialists from other sciences provide vital detailed evidence
which can revolutionise archaeological interpretation.
More to the point, this careful unravelling of an uniquely
well-preserved site brought a prehistoric hunting community of 7000 BC
to life in an entirely new, detailed and vivid way. He followed up this
work with a book, Prehistoric Europe: the Economic Basis (1952), which
was another landmark in archaeological interpretation.
European prehistory can also be a little narrow, not only in the
geographical range of its practitioners but also in not taking
sufficient account of the work of anthropologists and ethnographers,
students of just those modern simple societies which have to be studied
to draw inferences from analogy.
Unlike American and Australian archaeologists, we do not have recently
Stone-Age aborigines close at hand to study. Grahame Clark tackled this
problem early on with his Archaeology and Society (1939), and he
progressively broadened his approach to include overviews like World
Prehistory: an outline (1961). He recognised that in archaeology we have
a tool with which, if we wish, we can explore basic questions about the
origin and development of man, and about the universalities of human
behaviour.
This inculcation of a world-wide interest in Man's past is one of the
things I remember most clearly from my time at Cambridge. It seemed
quite natural to go and excavate among the Maya ruins of Central America
before coming to Scotland.
Of course our outlook of the 1950s and early 60s was still lit by the
afterglow of Empire and an international perspective was easily assumed.
The nation's horizons have shrunk somewhat since then and British
prehistory has felt the effects. It seems unlikely that the map of the
wide international distribution of his students which Clark included in
his Prehistory at Cambridge and Beyond (1989), could be repeated by
anyone now.
Grahame Clark was Disney Professor of Archaeology at Cambridge from
1952 until he retired, and Master of Peterhouse from 1973 to 1980. He
was appointed CBE in 1971 and knighted in 1992.
The numerous academic awards he received from all over the world
testify to his towering stature as a scholar and prehistorian. That of
the Erasmus Prize in 1990 said much; it is normally given to more
political figures and had never been previously received by an
archaeologist.
Honesty and straightforwardness were other appealing traits; praise
was sparingly given but if you had it you knew it was meant, and of high
value.

To give substance to the sentiments of community in the Scotland of
the nineties, co-operation and interdependence have to be rooted in our
everyday institutions, argues Isobel Lindsay
THE lead-up to the General Election will see a vigorous battle for the
ownership of language. Words matter to politicians. They spend as much
time fine-tuning their language and polishing up their slogans as any
poet would. You might be less than impressed by the results but don't
underestimate the importance of the political vocabulary.
There are words which are firmly linked to parties and which they are
unlikely to lose. ''Individual'' belongs to the Tories and they will
keep it. ''Scotland'' is obviously the SNP's strongest word, although
the use of Scottish Labour is an attempt to take a share of this.
''Equality'' and ''social justice'' are Labour words and irrespective of
what happens to policies, they are likely to own these for many years to
come.
Labour has tried recently to make a bid for ''opportunity'', a word
which served the Conservatives well in England in the eighties. In
Scotland ''opportunity'' tended to be translated as ''opportunist''. In
the context of the 1990s, going for ''opportunity'' is misjudging the
mood in England. It is ''security'' which is now the more potent word
which Labour needs to develop.
One word to watch out for is ''community''. It is interesting because
it has not yet acquired a firm political identity but is an attractive
word with a high emotive content. Labour has taken the lead in claiming
it. It has been one of Blair's favourite words. But there are
Conservatives who see its advantages and would like to shift it into the
Tory camp. Michael Forsyth and John Redwood have been sending out such
signals. It is interesting that it is the Tory right from which this has
been coming rather than from the remnants of ''One-Nation''
Conservatism. Why are they making a bid for ''community'' and have they
a chance of succeeding?
There are two principal reasons for this attempt to alter their
language. One is a recognition of failure and the other is the search
for a strategy which will continue the Thatcherite agenda in new
clothing. The previous appeal to crude market individualism has flopped
in Scotland and cannot be revived. Scotland favours the collective and
the co-operative. This fits the ethos of the country and the experience
of its people. The Scottish Tories need a disaster-limitation strategy.
This is particularly important if you are the MP for Stirling. Their
only hope of saving a few seats is to be seen to alter their approach. A
change in image has to be found. But if you still want to undermine the
public sector and create a world in which the rich are free to get
richer, what are your options? One is to try to separate ''the people''
from ''the public sector'', to juxtapose local civic action against
state provision of services.
An excessive decentralisation of power can end up as power retained.
There is no-one left who is strong enough to challenge the big
battalions. Just as too centralised a power structure negates democracy,
so too dispersed a power structure can disempower the public. It may
give you the right to decide how long the school lunch-break may be, but
weaken your ability to have more national resources spent on education.
Finding an appropriate distribution of decision-making is a crucial task
for the opposition parties in Scotland, a distribution which can give us
real choice at different levels. This is certainly not Mr Forsyth's
objective. His is to give the Thatcherite programme a makeover in Laura
Ashley style. To do this, he has to change the Tory language in an
attempt to take a share in ''community''.
It will be interesting to watch the intellectual gymnastics as those
who did not believe in society find that they must sound enthusiastic
about community. Even if the speech-writers go into overdrive, they are
handicapped by modern Conservative ideology. Ultimately any serious
commitment to community in modern society has to go in tandem with
commitment to the public sector. Where does that leave Tory ideology? If
Labour want to strengthen their ownership of the community idea, they
can do so with ideological consistency and their opportunities are
plentiful. But there has to be some genuine substance behind the
soundbites if they are to be credible.
The history of ''community'' as a political concept is long and
complex. Far from the communitarianism, fashionably promoted by American
sociologist Amitai Etzioni, being a new approach, it is in fact a very
old one. It was one of the major themes in nineteenth-century political
and social theory across the political spectrum. Conservatives like
Edmund Burke expressed anxiety about losing ''the bonds of the
subordinate community and dissolving it into an unsocial, uncivil,
unconnected chaos''. Later in the century Disraeli wrote of the problems
of urbanisation, ''In great cities men are brought together by the
desire of gain . . . modern society acknowledges no neighbour.'' Not the
comment we could expect to hear from a Tory Prime Minister today.
On the left, concern with community was also strong. Robert Owen with
his model community schemes in Lanarkshire and the United States had an
international reputation for his social reforms. Later William Morris
promoted the idea of co-operative, self-governing craft communities.
John Ruskin started the St George's Guild which financed village
settlements. The Guild Socialists advocated community based around the
workplace. There were many examples of utopian communities in North
America.
So ''community'' was high on the political and academic agenda
throughout the nineteenth century. Much of the concern sprang from a
desire to stem the tide of economic and technological change. But the
idea of society based on small-scale pluralistic social structures could
not survive the realities of modern industrial capitalism. The logic of
production and consumption moved towards the large-scale, the highly
mobile, the constant change. These are factors which, in combination,
militate against the continuity and solidarity of the traditional
community.
Scale on its own need not be a prohibitive factor. If there is
stability, people can create their urban villages and this was common in
the first half of the twentieth century. Many of us spent our early
years in communities of this kind, with high levels of continuity and
social integration. But when you add social and geographical mobility to
large scale and a decline in the central institution of work, the result
is a shift to individualism at the expense of community.
For some this may be attractive. Community certainly has its downside.
It may embrace too closely, be too restrictive, offer no escape when
things turn sour. But for many people its absence has more negative
qualities.
Without community values, there are great problems in maintaining
social cohesion and social control. This is one of the central tensions
of the present economic system. If you believe a culture of insecurity
is necessary to make the economy work successfully and people should
''get on their bikes'', putting personal advancement before everything
else, can you expect to apply ''community'' like a sticking plaster when
all the cuts and bruises of our economic system start to show? This is
the Tory dilemma.
But even for Labour, ''community'' will be of limited use if it is
viewed as merely a convenient sentiment. Unless it is rooted in the
social structures which shape everyday life, it is unlikely to have much
influence on behaviour.
Writing in the 1960s, the American sociologist, Robert Nisbet,
described communities as having ''emotional depth, moral commitment,
social cohesion, and continuity in time''. This may sound more like a
religious order than a typical Scottish town but it is a matter of
degree. The essence is that there is some commitment to each other which
goes beyond mere convenience, that there is a place where people know
others and are known. How do you make this happen? What are the
structural bases of community which might have some integrating force,
holding the individual in a supportive net of interdependence?
Work used to play a major role in doing this, especially for men. To
work in the same place for most of your life and to live nearby was a
common experience. The community of work reinforced the community of
residence and recreation. From your mid-teens onwards you took part in
the discipline and camaraderie of the workplace. You might see the same
people at a football match or in the pub. This is now the experience of
a declining minority of men although the pattern for women has varied.
A second structural basis for community lies in the shared provision
and consumption of public services, in which local government plays a
key role. The shared school, library, health centre, sports centre --
these can help to give people a sense of common ownership and common
experience. One of the major problems of post-war housing strategy was
the absence of these institutions around which stronger community
sentiment might have been built.
The third set of structures vital to community are those civic and
voluntary groups serving a great variety of interests -- churches,
political parties, sports clubs, play groups, lunch clubs, campaigning
organisations, self-help groups. Much of the strength and resilience of
community feeling depends on this sector and it has remarkable variety.
If political parties want to take ''community'' seriously, they have
to strengthen the structural base, not just tell us how to be good
neighbours. This is where the new Scottish Office team will run into
problems. They may want to flirt with the idea of strengthening local
communities but to do so will require strengthening the public sector.
Trying to rebuild some of the community ties based on employment will
not happen by leaving business to get on with it. That will be a recipe
for greater job insecurity and concentration of employment in larger
companies. An interventionist strategy is needed.
After 15 years of a Conservative Government which has disempowered and
devalued local authorities, what credibility is there for a Secretary of
State who tells us a year before a General Election that he wants strong
independent local councils?
This leaves only the voluntary sector as the key to the revival of
community in the Tory scenario. However the voluntary sector shares many
of the egalitarian values of the traditional public sector. Charities
for the disabled, the elderly, the young child, the homeless, want to
strengthen the rights of these groups and only the state can ultimately
guarantee this. Without state support, the position of the less
privileged groups would be even more precarious. Voluntary groups in the
social welfare field may act as agents of central and local government
and provide some services from their own resources, but they certainly
do not wish to subject those whose interests they represent to the
vagaries of public donations and lotteries for their basic needs.
Voluntary groups concerned with the environment or animal welfare want
more, not less public regulation. Those concerned with sport or the arts
cannot afford to provide facilities unaided. So if the Conservatives
hope to associate themselves with the civic sector, they will succeed
only by supporting active public intervention and increased public
expenditure. Where does that leave the Thatcherite project?
What are the opportunities for Labour? There are real advantages if
they can make ''community'' their word. It conveys an emotional
dimension unlike a word like ''state''. It suggests co-operation, mutual
aid, friendliness, responsibility. This provides a positive image of
collective action in contrast to the competitive individualism of the
Tories. But apart from image, community is also about substance. The
social problems of crime, deprivation, child care, isolation, require,
at least in part, locally based solutions. To convince the electorate
that there is real commitment, that this is more than another political
cliche, there has to be a serious policy portfolio focusing on community
development.
Local employment strategies are essential to this. Replacing the small
cliques and narrow remits of the present Local Enterprise Companies with
broader powers and more representative control is an essential first
step. Using unemployed local labour on projects selected and supported
by local communities, whether in the public, private or voluntary
sector, has to be a cornerstone of social policy.
Labour also needs a partnership policy for the civic sector which
recognises its role, guarantees its independence, and develops its
relationship with local government and the new Scottish parliament. The
majority of the population is represented in some way by this sector.
The level of active participation is far greater than in political
parties. The problem for many groups who are dependent on some public
funding is not just the level of financial support but the
''short-termism''. Consultation is often erratic or too late in the
decision-making process. The development of the non-profit sector needs
to be central not marginal for local development.
And Labour needs imaginative and responsive local authorities. To give
credit where it is due, despite recent criticism levelled at some
councils, it is local government in Scotland which has played the key
role in protecting local communities from Tory excesses and they have
often used initiative and flexibility in so doing. But where are the
plans to make community councils more effective? What priority will be
given to the decentralisation of functions where this is appropriate?
Plans for local government in the Scottish parliament are likely to
include a general power of competence and some form of entrenchment.
Bringing together some new and existing policies, building them into a
theme of community development, projecting these as a practical
programme which people can understand, this would start to look like a
genuine ''New Labour''.
The sentiments of community lie comfortably within the socialist
tradition but, to give them substance in the Scotland of the nineties,
co-operation and interdependence have to be rooted in our everyday
institutions, not just in folk memory.

AN industrial tribunal has heard that InterCity loses #750,000 every
year through catering frauds.
One of the methods used is for stewards to wash and re-use plastic
coffee cups with their own coffee and pocket the proceeds.
Mr Alexander MacAdie, of 84 Craig Road, Cathcart, was a chief steward
with InterCity West Coast Ltd, of London, when he was sacked on May 3
this year after 35 years service.
Mr MacAdie told the tribunal in Glasgow that there wasn't sufficient
reason to sack him as the decision had been made on the assumption he
intended to defraud his employer. He claimed compensation and
reinstatement.
InterCity denied the sacking was unfair because Mr MacAdie had been
fired for possessing various cups of beverages on March 19, 1995.
The tribunal found that, at the conclusion of the disciplinary hearing
on May 3, 1995, Mr MacAdie was found guilty of the charge: ''That on
Sunday March 19, 1995, whilst working the 12.30 hours Glasgow to Preston
service, you were found in possession of two hot chocolate, five Brook
Bond Choice Blend tea, and two large Kenco coffee cups,'' and was
dismissed because this was contrary to rule G54 of the train catering
operating manual.
The breach came to light when an InterCity assistant onboard manager
boarded the train at Carlisle for a routine hygiene check and saw the
steward putting the cups in his bag.
The tribunal noted: ''From the start, the applicant admitted doing
what he was charged with, apologised for it, and accepted that it broke
the rules.
''As a chief steward, the applicant was well aware why the respondents
placed so much importance on rule G54: to endeavour to reduce the huge
losses (#750,000 a year) from catering frauds such as stewards washing
and re-using plastic coffee cups with their own coffee and keeping the
proceeds.
''He had been on a weekend course for chief stewards when this was
highlighted.''
The tribunal said the disciplinary hearing was entitled to reject Mr
MacAdie's explanation of collecting the nine cups after use, taking them
home, and washing them ''all to make tea for the staff and the senior
conductor''.
In accepting the dismissal was fair, the tribunal stated: ''The
respondent was entitled to take a serious view of this particular
misconduct, which was a dismissal offence.
''The purpose of rule G54 is to prevent catering staff perpetrating
frauds, which are by their nature difficult to detect.
''The respondent was entitled to take into account the prevalence of
this type of misconduct among stewards and the need to deal with it
severely as a deterrent to others who might be similarly tempted; the
very large losses involved, which the respondent is trying to stop; and
the breach of trust from a chief steward in a promoted position who was
meant to be setting an example to his junior staff.''

THE company running Clydebank's showpiece leisure complex has ceased
trading in the town but the jobs of 40 employees have been saved.
The district council, which owns the Play Drome centre, took over
control of the complex minutes after being advised that Frontier
Holdings were ceasing to trade at Clydebank.
Mr James McNally, the council's chief executive, said yesterday: ''The
Play Drome did not close. We received word that the company was ceasing
to trade at the Play Drome and we immediately took it over.
''From now, we will run the Play Drome ourselves.''
Frontier Holdings, which operates two other complexes in the Borders,
won the Play Drome contract two years ago with the lowest estimate of
#150,000-a-year in management fees -- half the subsidy required by the
nearest competing company.
However, a downturn in operating revenue -- blamed on additional
attractions at Glasgow's recently-opened leisure complex at nearby
Scotstoun -- sparked off a crisis, with Frontier having to ask for more
money to stay afloat at Clydebank.
A spokesperson at Frontier was not available for comment.

<TEXT>
A TEENAGE Scot was yesterday under arrest facing charges of raping a
13-year-old English girl on the holiday island of Ibiza.
The Civil Guard in Madrid named the youth as Brian Montgomery, 16,
from Dalkeith, near Edinburgh.
Police said the alleged attack took place on a beach near the resort
of San Juan on the island's north coast late on Wednesday night.
The girl, from Somerset, was on holiday with her parents. They took
her to the Civil Guard headquarters in the resort and Montgomery was
arrested the following day.
Yesterday, the accused, who was on holiday with an older couple, was
remanded by a local magistrate pending a decision whether to let a
juvenile court handle the case.
A Civil Guard spokesman said: ''It is now up to the courts to decide
what action to take. I don't know if these young people met on holiday
or knew each other before they came to Spain.
''The alleged rape took place on a beach late at night.''
He did not know whether the alleged victim had been taken home to
Britain by her parents.
It was the second case of alleged rape involving a young Scot in Spain
in less than 10 days.
A 14-year-old boy from Stirling was arrested at Estartit on the Costa
Brava for the alleged rape of a 15-year-old girl from Stockport,
Lancashire. He was later released because he was under the age of
criminal responsibility in Spain. The papers relating to the case are to
be sent to the procurator-fiscal at Stirling.
Later in the day, Montgomery was ordered to remain in custody for 72
hours by the judge. Because of his age, it was ruled that Montgomery
should not be classified as a ''prisoner''.
He is now due appear before the judge early next week after a review
of the case.
Also attending the hearing, held behind closed doors, was the alleged
victim, who went to the court accompanied by her parents. The judge gave
the parents permission to take their daughter back to England.
Montgomery's parents, at home in Dalkeith, have been kept informed of
the case against their son.

A UNIVERSITY is to be built in Europe's biggest shopping centre at
Gateshead, Tyne and Wear.
The MetroCentre university will be sited alongside department stores
and restaurants.
The joint venture between the University of Sunderland and Gateshead
College of Further Education is to be called Learning World.
The MetroCentre has 6000 workers and attracts 26 million visitors a
year who will be able to use the campus for day and night classes.
A university spokeswoman said: ''The MetroCentre is a community in
itself like any other but with no centre for learning.
''Staff find it hard to get to evening classes because of their shifts
while there are shoppers who come regularly who may want to use it.
''We will have full- time staff and regular lectures and tutorials. It
is a satellite campus of the main university.''
The facility will have 15 tutorial rooms and anInternet centre.
The spokeswoman added: ''People can take degrees, HNCs, MBAs, and
other qualifications in hundreds of different subjects or just use the
computers. And there is a creche on site too. This is an unique idea.''
Learning World is expected to open early next year.

<EDITION>1</EDITION>
<PAGE>7</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>976126154</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE Government has been criticised over plans to scrap social work
training for probation officers.
A proposed shake-up in the rules means that diplomas, involving a
two-year course of study at a university or college, will no longer be
an essential requirement for the job.
The plans were unveiled in a Home Office consultation document
published earlier this year.
Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Alan Beith said yesterday:
''The probation service has a far better record than the Home Office for
recruiting people with experience in other fields such as the armed
forces and the police.
''That record can be maintained without denying recruits proper
training for the job.
''The training can be modified and improved but it should still be up
to higher education standard and be continually monitored.''
Home Secretary Michael Howard defended the changes, saying on BBC
Radio 4: ''At present, in order to qualify as a probation officer, you
have to complete a full-time two-year course to get a diploma in social
work.
''You don't need that diploma to become a social worker, you don't
need that to become a chief probation officer, and a retired naval
officer has recently been appointed a chief probation officer without
it.
''Obviously if you insist on a full-time two-year course, you are
going to deter a number of mature people who would make excellent
probation officers. So we have put forward proposals for different ways
of qualifying as a probation officer.
''We have consulted on those proposals and we will announce our
decision quite soon.''

HOW wonderful it was to hear the crowd at Ibrox, before the kick-off
with Borussia Dortmund, lustily singing Rule Britannia instead of that
nationalist dirge The Flower of Scotland, which is to patriotism what
''Beans Means Heinz'' is to haute cuisine.
It may have had something to do with the fact Rangers' opponents were
Germans and football crowds enjoy taunting and baiting teams from the
Fatherland with a vitriol matched only by those propoganda films from
the early forties and Basil Fawlty.
Yet there seems something more subliminal in this choice of proud
defiance. It could be that Rangers' supporters consider themselves more
intelligent than the inchoate mass who populate the terracings and felt
it appropriate to give voice to words which were, after all, written by
a Scot, the eighteenth-century poet, James Thomson. I suspect, however,
that any further inquiries about Thomson or his famous 1726 poem Winter,
the first in English to take nature as its theme and which was so
influential in the paintings of Constable and others, would have met
with a blank stare.
The significance, then, lies in the fact that when faced with a
formidable rival from the continent, there is the understandable
tendency to wrap round us the memories of when a United Kingdom
triumphed against even more overwhelming odds. The feel-good factor of
the British Empire when the Scots and the English looked outwards to the
world and felt a Christian mission to scatter the spores of our
civilisation.
What stark contrast to the naval-gazing of the separatists in the SNP
with their revisionist history from Braveheart to the supposed Auld
Alliance with France. Braveheart is as historically accurate as the SNP
budget is economically sound. And the Auld Alliance is as empty of
significance as the rest of nationalist sloganising. You will find few
Frenchmen who even recognise the term and those who do remember it only
as a sad commentary on those Scots who often gave their lives to fight
for France and were deluded in the belief that the French would
reciprocate, which they rarely did.
Scotland has suffered periodically from appalling judgment from those
who aspire to lead the country. But the debasing of debate as to who is,
or is not, an Uncle Tom or Tartan Traitor represents a new low. It
demonstrates that we now have the worst leadership for a generation and
just at a time when we need the best.
The irony is that both Alex Salmond and George Robertson should have
much to offer. Salmond is not a racist. He finds references to Uncle
Toms as offensive as the rest of us. But the continual anti-English
rhetoric in his party has merely been a prelude to the inevitability of
these distasteful outbursts. There was a time when Scots would get
uppity only when some crass ignoramus from the BBC in London claimed
that a Scottish sporting hero was an Englishman or we would joke that we
didn't care who won a match be it football, rugby, or tiddlywinks, so
long as it was not the English.
But this has now grown to overt hostility as anyone who has been in a
pub and watched England on TV during the World Cup can testify. In fact,
there is nothing the English can do right. If the Government institutes
a policy in Scotland before England we are ''guinea pigs''. The other
way round and it is an insult to all Scots.
Even Roseanna Cunningham finds a conspiracy in the National Lottery
when she complained that many Scots had no opportunity to buy a lottery
ticket on September 16. It doesn't matter that it was the result of a
technical problem. ''If a similar foul-up affected half of England, it
is hard to believe that Camelot would have adopted the business-as-usual
attitude that they did,'' she is reported as saying. All this is not a
pride in Scotland, it is a distaste of England. This is the same
inferiority complex which made us spear-carriers in the Auld Alliance.
It is not a condition which would have been recognised in the
Enlightenment nor among the thousands of Scots who provided the cement
of Empire.
The blame, however, does not just lie with the nationalists. They seek
a political advantage in selling their country short. The Labour Party
is equally culpable and for the same reason. I personally think that
George Robertson could be a significant Secretary of State for Scotland.
For him to try to prove his Scottish credentials by declaring during the
Calton Hill debate that he would plump for a seat in a Scottish assembly
rather than playing a prominent role in UK Government is a shame and a
waste. Yet he had no alternative because the only justification for
advocating devolution is that Scotland has been getting a raw deal from
Westminster.
The only answer then is to gather on Calton Hill -- and blame the
English. This devalues the Union. When was the last time you heard a
significant Scottish Labour politician vigorously defend the Union? This
has led to contortions of policy with promises of an independent voice
in Europe and the creation of Scottish embassies abroad. How does this
significantly differ from the nationalists? The only difference,
perhaps, boils down to Labour wanting to hold on to the
over-representation of seats in Scotland to prop up an English Labour
Government in Westminster and for which they are willing to transfer
billions of pounds. This is treating Scotland like some
nineteenth-century rotten borough.
Into the centre of all this comes the Liberals, for whom most people
at General Elections don't give a second thought. They would prostitute
themselves for just a kindly look from Labour as they proved during the
Lib-Lab pact of the late seventies. This time they have been luckier in
that Labour has had to give way in the self-styled Constitutional
Convention just to give that body some credibility. The Liberals have
long known that only by fiddling the electoral system by proportional
representation would their unelectable party ever seize a lever of
power. It has, however, restored a cockiness to the extent that the
normally supine Edinburgh Liberals have accused the ruling Labour group
of ''Stalinist'' tendencies. Harsh words, indeed.
Scots Secretary Michael Forsyth has wisely remained aloof from the
back-biting and the venom which has spewed out from party conferences
and on to the letters pages. Better to let the electorate see the
factionalism and tribalism which now passes for political debate in
Scotland and figure out for themselves just how these warring parties
will co-operate in an assembly to any benefits but their own.

HIGHER harbour charges at Stornoway for the new ferry, Isle of Lewis,
will cause fares to rise by 10%, CalMac claimed yesterday.
Mr Colin Patterson, CalMac's ferry chief, made the claim in a letter
to Stornoway Pier and Harbour Commission in response to a 265% increase
in berthing charges.
Mr Patterson wrote: ''I would have to advise you that at the level of
charges shown this constitutes a cost increase of some #200,000 per
annum, which represents 5.7% of the revenue generated on the
Stornoway-Ullapool service.
''As we cannot possibly absorb cost increases of this magnitude we
would intend to increase all charges on the Stornoway-Ullapool service
for 1996/97 by 5.7% above the norm, and make it publicly known the
reasons for so doing.''
Mr Patterson added that the increase would average 9.4%, ''across the
board and I feel you should be aware of this''.
The harbour commission's general manager, Mr Murdo Macleod, said he
was surprised at Mr Patterson's letter because the new dues had been
agreed with him and his financial director, Mr Gordon Mackenzie, at a
meeting.
Mr Macleod said the increase in berthing fees had come about because
the previous ferry Suilven was 1908 tonnes compared to 6753 tonnes for
the new Isle of Lewis. The discount for the Suilven dues had been 80%
and for the new ferry had been increased to 85%. An expected 5.7%
increase on articulated vehicles, cars, and passengers was agreed with
Mr Patterson at the meeting.
However, Mr Macleod said the harbour commission would monitor the
situation to assess whether the percentage discount could be increased.
He also pointed out that a new bollard requested by CalMac had been
installed at a cost of #2590 and the raft to hold the vessel off at the
stern had cost #10,590.
Mr Macleod added: ''This letter has obviously been written for public
consumption.''
The harbour commission has agreed to write to Mr Patterson's
expressing surprise at his comments on the increased dues after they had
been agreed with him.
It also agreed to increase harbour dues from November 12 by 3% except
for the charges on fish landings and for vehicles and passengers using
the ferry.
* The new Isle of Lewis ferry has also caused traffic problems at
Stornoway harbour's No 1 pier, the commission said yesterday.
It approved recommendations by the harbourmaster, Captain Angus
Mackenzie, to instal gate barriers around the harbour which will be
manned one hour before the ferry arrives.
During this time, only permit holders -- persons working in the
Maritime Buildings or on the ferry, disabled persons, taxis, and
commercial traffic -- will be allowed access to the area.
Temporary car parking will be provided at Esplanade Road for those
people meeting or dropping off ferry passengers. This will be closed
except at ferry times.
It was also agreed that the use of the freight transit shed on the
pier -- occupied by haulage firm D R Macleod should be terminated as
soon as possible. It was felt that this type of operation should not be
permitted in an area used by the public.
Discussions are also to take place with hauliers regarding the
prohibition of unlicenced shunter units on the pier. The commission
agreed to seek tenders for a swipe card controlled barrier at the
Fishermen's Co-operative entrance to the inner harbour.

THE Scottish Office has agreed to look at the Skye Bridge tolls for
small commercial vehicles which could leave some crofters, tradesmen,
and small businessmen on the island facing a 300% increase in the cost
of getting on and off the island once the #23m bridge opens in two
weeks' time.
This follows a meeting at St Andrews House yesterday with Mr Lorne
MacLeod, chief executive of Skye and Lochalsh Enterprise (Sale).
Operators Skye Bridge Ltd insisted yesterday that the problem had been
grossly exaggerated.
Under the detailed toll regime for the Skye Bridge, published two
weeks ago, the owners of Low Goods Vehicles (LGVs between 1.5 tons and
3.5 tons) will have to pay #9.80 to cross in summer or winter or #9.51
if a book of 10 discount tickets is bought.
At present, most of this classification can cross the Caledonian
MacBrayne ferry as cars paying #5.40 or #3.10 with discount tickets. On
the ferry, the vehicles are classed according to length, anything under
5m paying the same as a car.
After the meeting, Sale issued a statement saying: ''Mr MacLeod
stressed the difficulties which would be caused to businesses, crofters,
and others in Skye and Lochalsh by the Skye Bridge company's decision to
impose such a large increase in toll charges for the bridge compared to
the ferry on the users of light vans.''
Mr Russell Thomson, general manager of the bridge who for
five-and-a-half years was also the manager of the ferry, feels that the
problem may have been exaggerated.
''There seems to be the idea that all small vans will have to pay this
LGV price. That is not the case. All small vans such as Astras and
Escorts will cross as cars which will mean they will pay #5.20 in the
high season, #4.30 in winter and just #2.44 if they buy a book of ten
tickets.''

AS Carmen drew to a close, the crowd's interest was waning. Maybe it
was opera's lack of realism, maybe they were just a bit overdosed on
melodrama, but they did seem to be getting a bit restless. Before long
their interest picked up as the finale moved on and it was ''cue tears,
cue blood on the walls, cue death''.
What with all this high drama, it wasn't much like real life. I
suppose it wasn't meant to be real, it was supposed to be opera, and Don
Jose was giving it pelters.
''Je t'ai-aime,'' he sang passionately, arms outspread, imploring her
to return his affections.
''Mais je ne t'ai-ai-aime pas,'' she sang, sobbing.
''Mais je t'ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-me,'' he countered skilfully. (As debates
go, it was a bit of a loser all round.)
''Mais moi,'' she trilled. (Oh, here we go. Cue big finish.) ''Je ne
t'ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-me pas.'' Supposedly racked with emotion, but
still able to sing loud enough and high enough to shatter the glasses in
the adjoining bar.
You get the picture, it was an old-fashioned operatic story of ''boy
meets girl, boy loses girl, boy and girl sing unimaginably long songs to
each other, boy loses girl to macho bullfighter, boy runs amok with
loaded firearm''. All the while the English translation flickered over
the top of the stage, as faithful and unimaginative as Greyfriar's
Bobby, making the dialogue seem quite hilarious. ''I love you.'' ''But I
don't love you.'' ''But I love you,'' etc, etc.
Apparently operas are in French or Italian because they're more suited
to being sung. The main benefit of this is that because it's in a
foreign language, all the arty types don't have to acknowledge that
their heartstrings are being tugged by dialogue like ''I am missing my
mother who sits alone in a cottage hospital outside of Seville''. After
a while, you stop caring how good the tunes are, and you realise that,
as artistic forms of expression go, it's all a bit limited. You can't
imagine opera dealing with the gritty realities of a kitchen sink drama,
can you? (Then again, the Italian for ''Pass me the whippet's muzzle,
I'm going for a walk'' might be quite beautiful). Still, all things
considered, it's a good job that we found other ways to express the
vagaries of the human condition: could anyone have kept a straight face
if Humphrey Bogart were to sing ''Ice pour te regarde, mon enfant'' in a
light soprano?
It's not mass entertainment, that's for sure. The only time opera was
ever accepted by Hollywood was when they made the Student Prince. Even
then they made Mario Lanza stay behind the scenes while a suitably slim
body mimed his vocals. (The Student Prince? Ha. No rugby songs, no-one
puking, and no-one with an Oxfam coat. Where's the realism in that?)
When you look at the price of a ticket, it's no surprise that it has
not become an art form for the masses. If a football fan were to fork
out that kind of money on match day, he would also be entitled to a
three-course meal, the match ball, and an invite back to Ally McCoist's
for dinner afterwards.
A wee bit of fidelity to the actual script wouldn't have gone amiss
either. I'm no opera expert, and I don't want to be too picky, but even
I'm fairly certain that Carmen is not supposed to be a 40 year old with
a big nose and ginger hair. And to be subtle about it (Now there's a
first - Ed), how much does a Wonderbra cost? At 60 quid a ticket, the
least we could expect is that Carmen might look as if she were a Spanish
seductress.
Come the interval, the tin lid was well put on, I was addressed as if
I were a piece of garden refuse when I asked for a beer. I was told that
they didn't serve beers, and was then reduced to drinking some sort of
fluorescent red cocktail. What sort of a real man finds himself in an
opera house drinking a fruit cocktail? Don't answer that.
All in all I really enjoyed it. Only a real ignoramus could fail to be
moved by the spectacle, and I'm only the rank of amateur inverted snob.
Some of the tunes were great, but to quote my father's opinions on the
music I used to like, though, ''It's so loud . . . and you can't
understand a bloody word they're saying!''
As I stood in the bar afterwards, beer in hand, Graeme was going up to
get the next round. He asked me what I wanted. ''I'll have a pint of
heav-ea-ea-ea-eavy thanks,'' I intoned in my loudest singing voice.
Everyone turned round to gawk. ''You're a nightmare,'' he cursed. I
didn't care, I'd already been photographed in an opera house drinking a
strawberry Daquiri; how much more embarrassing can it get?

IN the US persuading the terminally ill to sell their life insurance
policies to release money to fund anything from medical care to the
holiday of a lifetime is a long established practice. But with tales of
coffin chasers hanging around Aids wards and stories of dubious
middlemen who promise great riches but then don't deliver, the business
has acquired something of a tarnished image.
Across the Atlantic they call them viatical settlements, from the
Latin meaning long journey, and it is a business which is starting to
get a foothold over here. It even surfaced in last week's episode of
Casualty, the popular hospital-based television drama, with a young wife
trying to persuade her husband, who had Aids, to sell his policy to a
pushy salesman.
The way the incident was portrayed has angered Richard Legg of Life
Benefit Resources which introduced viatical settlements to the UK three
years ago and which so far has bought 600 policies from people who are
terminally ill.
''We are not coffin chasers. Casualty showed the salesman going into
the hospital where a patient has just been diagnosed as suffering from
an Aids-related illness. I saw the script in the spring and I told the
programme makers that this wasn't how we do business in the UK. I accept
they are writing television drama, but we would never visit someone in
hospital.
''Most of our cases come from financial advisers who are helping the
terminally ill sort out their finances. When people do come to us
directly we always suggest they take financial advice before accepting
our offer.''
But can viatical settlements ever be justified? The answer to this
must be yes. People take out life insurance to protect their dependents
if they die prematurely. For example, most people have life insurance
covering their mortgage. Others may have term insurance to cover the
loss of their income while their children are growing up.
That's the theory. In practice, lots of people have insurance policies
they don't need. The mortgage may be paid off and the children may have
left home, or there may be no close relatives or dependents to leave the
money to. In these circumstances viatical settlements make sense. There
may even be occasions where the family is prepared to inherit less in
order to give a terminally ill relative the best couple of years of
their life.
There are three firms which are registered with financial regulator,
PIA: Life Benefit Resources, International Viatical Settlements and
Securitised Endowment Contracts. They are authorised on an
execution-only basis and are not allowed to give financial advice.
But how do viatical settlements work? Which life insurance policies
are acceptable, and how can you be sure you are getting a fair price?
Max Rosen of Securitised Endowment Contracts says he can offer between
55% and 87% of the sum insured. ''I buy endowment policies, term
insurance, whole of life and unit-linked policies. I have even managed
to buy an old section 226A policy where the life insurance formed part
of a pension plan. The policy must be at least two years old, when there
is normally a suicide clause, and have at least two-and-half years left
to run.''
The company buying the policy makes an offer based on how long the
insured person is expected to live. At Securitised Endowment Contracts a
panel of medical experts is brought in to analyse the patient's notes.
The company buying the policy then carries on paying the premiums until
the policyholder dies, when it collects the insurance money.
Taking a viatical settlement invariably gives the dying person a
better return than selling an endowment policy on the second-hand market
or asking the life insurance company for a surrender value. However,
some life insurance companies now build viatical settlements into their
policies as standard, so it is always worth checking to see if your
policy offers this facility.
Richard Legg of Life Benefit Resources says his principal customers
are Aids and cancer sufferers. ''Half the settlements are used to pay
for everyday expenses; the other half get blown on luxuries. Young men
often use the money to buy the car of their dreams; the middle aged
really do go on round-the-world cruises.''
The three companies mentioned here are all registered with the PIA, so
if anything goes wrong there is a regulator who can deal with your
complaints. Avoid unauthorised companies offering viatical settlements.
Last year, one broker offering them was unable to deliver when it failed
to find purchasers for the policies. No-one was out of pocket, but for
obvious reasons the terminally ill can't hang around for their money.

<HEADLINE>Good reasons why you should still opt for your share</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
CHANCELLOR Kenneth Clarke has some head scratching to do over the
controversial subject of share options before he gets to his feet to
present his November Budget. In the eyes of many, what he has achieved
so far is a pretty comprehensive botch-up. Maybe that is what happens
when you alter a taxation system before breakfast.
Far from getting the political kudos he had probably been expecting
when he announced that the so-called ''executive'' share option schemes
would have their tax privileges taken away seconds after the Greenbury
Report recommended this, the sweeping nature of his attack was
criticised by everybody from Sir Richard Greenbury himself onwards and
outwards.
The Chancellor's slight retraction later left the fat cats with their
cream pots intact but made the granting of further options by companies
wanting to provide incentives for employees look a pretty unattractive
proposition.
The message for employees, however, has to be: if options survive and
you are offered any, grab them.
Even with the severe tax penalties they are definitely worth having
simply because you cannot lose. Companies would still like to give them.
A major reason for bringing in the ''executive'' options back in the
early eighties was to enable companies hard hit by recession to attract
top-line managers to drag them back to prosperity. Finances would not
stand paying the sort of salaries these people could command, so share
options with tax concessions both attracted them and gave an incentive
to perform.
The schemes -- there have been well in excess of 5000 created -- were
extended to selected groups of employees as well. By and large this is
felt to have worked well. Research, mainly in the US, suggests companies
with employee share schemes often perform better than those without.
There is no proof, of course, that out-performance is a result of the
share scheme, but a survey of several hundred UK companies undertaken by
ProShare, the body which campaigns for wider share ownership, has shown
an overwhelming majority in favour of them.
Unfortunately, public disapproval of the large sums scooped up by
directors of privatised companies, which hardly needed dragging back
from the brink of bankruptcy, came at a time when the Inland Revenue
seems to have been concerned that share option schemes might become a
way of paying people part of their normal salaries tax free.
So far, Mr Clarke has declined to retract the decision to remove the
tax concessions. That means that when the options are taken up (between
three and 10 years after the grant), income tax will have to be paid
immediately on the difference between the option price and the market
price on the day the option is exercised, even if the shares are
retained.
He is, however, being urged to re-think the whole thing on the grounds
that few people will be able to stump up the option money and the tax
money together and will probably sell out, which reduces their
continuing involvement with the company.
Shareholders may question whether it is worth their while agreeing to
the dilution of their own proportionate holdings by enlarging the
capital to provide the shares for the options. Among compromises being
suggested is limiting the value of options which can be granted to quite
a bit lower than the #100,000 or four times salary, whichever is
greater, allowed under the original scheme. And to help people further
down the scale, gains of up to around the #25,000 level should remain
tax free.
Thought is also being given to methods of ensuring that the option
holder does not get an effort-free gain which has been brought about
simply by a general rise in the level of the share market rather than
out-performance by the employing company.
People with Save As You Earn or ShareSave option plans open to all
qualifying employees, and not just directors and executives, were not
affected by the Chancellor's clamp down. If your company offers you this
sort of deal it is well worth thinking seriously about.
Unfortunately, under the present rules, you have to save month by
month for five years, salting the cash away into a special account with
an approved building society or bank, to provide the money to take up
the options. Savings must be between #10 and #250 a month.
The fact that you have to save the money, in contrast to the
''executive'' schemes, has proved a strong disincentive. Only around
1000 schemes have been created, and it is estimated that just a quarter
of the options which could be granted under the restrictions are, in
fact, taken up. That is a shame because it is a valuable tax break and
may well also benefit the economy by making employees more interested in
seeing their company increase its profits and push its share price up.
Present rules allow the company to issue options at a discount of
around 20% to the stock market value at the time of granting. As with
the ''executive'' options, these are given free, but you do not pay
income tax on the gain when you exercise the option and buy the shares.
You can even transfer #3000-worth in any one tax year into a single
company personal equity plan, and thus avoid both capital gains tax and
income tax on future dividends.
The Government has repeatedly declared its support for wider share
ownership, and must agree that employee shareholdings are good for both
the company and the country because it gives tax concessions to approved
profit sharing schemes which allocate shares. So let's hope Mr Clarke
does have another look at the whole subject of share options, and that
more, rather than fewer, companies will introduce them.

IF you have put off completing your tax return for the year ended
April 5, you must now get down to the evil moment. Delaying beyond
October 31, especially if you are a higher rate taxpayer, can be costly.
If you haven't yet looked at the form, you may be confused by the
number of different types of income it lists, especially from
investments and savings. For example, there are seven different types of
dividend -- and each has to be listed separately.
Ordinary ones are easiest to deal with. These are paid by UK companies
and, in addition to the cash received, you have to add the tax credit
shown on the dividend counterfoil to arrive at the taxable gross income.
Many companies nowadays offer scrip dividends, where instead of cash
you receive an allocation of shares. The problem with these is that even
though you get no cash they are taxable. The amount taxed is usually
equivalent to the cash dividend alternative, but if this is 15% more or
less than the value of the new shares on the first day they are dealt
with, it is the market value. Commonly this arises when stock dividends
are of the enhanced type, but a sudden fluctuation in market prices can
trigger this rule. This can be hard to spot as the company voucher won't
necessarily give you enough details to work out the figure for your
return.
New for 1994-95 tax returns is the foreign income dividends or FIDs.
These appear to all intents and purposes the same as ordinary ones. The
tax credit attaching is, however, notional and for non-taxpayers cannot
be repaid so these must be listed separately. They are hard to spot --
the dividend voucher will say if it is a FID, but this can be in small
print.
Dividends from foreign companies must also be listed separately. Each
one will probably have suffered a mix of UK and foreign tax. You have to
add both types to the cash payment to arrive at the gross amount that
goes on your return and list these deductions as well.
As if this were not tricky enough, you must repeat the process of
separating out payments from unit trusts. These will also pay ordinary
dividends and FIDs.
All dividends from companies or unit trusts, UK or foreign, are taxed
at 20% unless you pay at a higher rate. Unfortunately, unit trusts can
also pay income in the form of interest from which tax at the basic rate
of 25% is deducted. If you are liable to higher rate tax it is important
you identify this type of receipt and enter it in the correct part of
the return, otherwise you will pay too much. Again, the only way to tell
which type of income is which is to read the unit trust voucher.
In many cases it is a fine distinction between types of dividend and
it may make little difference to your total tax bill. But you can't rely
on this, so remember -- the apparently simple task of listing your
investment income may warrant a bit more care than in the past.

THE feeding frenzy in the electricity sector gained fresh impetus last
night when Southern announced that it was in talks which were likely to
lead to a recommended offer from the company, writes ROBERT POWELL.
The City buzzed with speculation over the identity of the un-named
suitor, who is expected to pay around #2700m for Southern, valuing the
company at around #10 per share.
Many figures were pointed at National Power, which is thought to be
anxious to require a regional electricity company following PowerGen's
#2000m bid for Midlands Electricity at #10 per share earlier this month.
''Ever since PowerGen bid for Midlands, everyone has been saying that
National Power, the other generator, will have to follow suit,'' one
electricity analyst said.
But Ian Graham at Natwest Securities in Edinburgh, said the mystery
bidder could equally be British Gas, Houston Industries and Central
South West, outbid by North West Water in their offer for Norweb, or a
French utility.
Southern shares were talked up by market rumours of bid talks all day
and closed up 61p at 897p before Southern confirmed that it was in
takeover discussions shortly afterwards.
Southern brings to seven the number of regional electricity companies
that have been the object of takeover bids over the last 12 months.
Trafalgar House eventually dropped its pursuit of Northern earlier
this year, but the outcome of the other six is still pending.

PHARMACEUTICALS
PHARMACEUTICALS group Fisons, under #1700m hostile bid siege from
US-French group Rhone-Poulenc Rorer (RPR), yesterday brought out its big
guns, writes CHRIS STONE.
The company is forecasting an operating profit of not less than #100m
for the pharmaceutical operation, the promise of a final dividend of 3p
to lift the total 16% to 5p, and three link-up deals with other
pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.
Collaboration with other companies in the field is part of Fisons
growth strategy using its global sales and marketing infrastructure.
Further deals are in prospect with the company in negotiation on
international marketing collaboration with a major specialist and in
Ultrahaler feasibility studies with other industry players.
RPR, though, immediately said it was ''unimpressed'' at Fisons' deals
and forecasts. A spokesman said: ''If this is supposed to be a knock-out
blow it's a pathetic effort, much more like being on the receiving end
of a punch from someone who is shadow boxing.''
This comeback is par for the course for RPR but its predictable
rubbishing of Fisons' defence does not answer the question of whether or
not it is going to raise the bid terms.
Yesterday's package from Fisons did not do very for the share price
which firmed just 1[1/2]p to 257[1/2]p but it still remains well above
the 240p a share cash terms although it has eased from the 260p plus it
stood at immediately after the bid.

TRANSPORT
BUS giant Stagecoach yesterday announced plans to team up with the
management of Network SouthCentral to bid for both that rail franchise
and the Gatwick Express operation.
SouthCentral and Gatwick are among the latest four franchises to be
put up for sale by the Government.
Perth-based Stagecoach, which looks set to bid for InterCity East
Coast and Midland Mainlines on its own, believes its alliance with
SouthCentral management, to be known as Capital Coast Railways, could
give the two proposed joint bids a greater chance of success.
But it remained tight-lipped on whether it might seek a similar
alliance with ScotRail management when the Scottish network is
eventually put through the privatisation process.
Government plans for ScotRail's sell-off have been delayed and the
sale process will probably not get underway until next spring at the
earliest.
Brian Cox, the executive director who is spearheading Stagecoach's
rail campaign, said of the alliance with SouthCentral management: ''If
we can combine our bus knowledge with their rail knowledge, that puts us
in a good position for buying.
''It is also good for the vendor (the Government), because the vendor
hopefully has more confidence that the combined team will be
effective.''
Stagecoach is already a shortlisted bidder for the first three rail
franchises to be put up for sale.
It is likely to know before the end of the year whether its bids for
Great Western Railways, which runs between London, Bristol and Wales,
South West Trains, which takes in Exeter, Southampton and London, and
the London-Tilbury-Southend line have been successful.
With Stagecoach having borne the brunt of a serious crackdown by UK
competition authorities on consolidation within the bus industry, rail
offers a valuable growth opportunity.
The number of franchises which Stagecoach might end up running depends
on the size of those it might successfully acquire, as well as the
Government's view on how many the bus company should be allowed to
operate.
Stagecoach sees significant benefits flowing from ''sensible
integration of bus and rail services'' in the event of successful joint
bids for Network SouthCentral and Gatwick Express.
Asked about the possibility of a joint Stagecoach/ScotRail management
bid when the Scottish franchise is put up for sale, Mr Cox said: ''You
know where Stagecoach is -- anything is possible but some things happen
and some things don't happen.
''I think that is something for the future. Frankly, we have so many
things on our plate at the moment that I don't think ScotRail is very
high on our consideration list.''

Tokyo, Friday -- Daiwa Bank has sold real estate and securities to
compensate for the $1100m loss it suffered from actions blamed on a
rogue trader at its New York branch, the bank announced today.
Daiwa sold land and portions of buildings it owned which housed seven
of its branch outlets, including ones in the major cities of Tokyo,
Osaka, and Hiroshima, to raise 34 billion yen, a bank spokesman said.
Daiwa said its branches were expected to remain in the buildings it
had sold, and that it would rent the spaces from the new owners, three
Daiwa-affiliated real estate firms.
The bank is covering the remainder of the loss with 50 billion yen
from profits and 30 billion yen from sales of securities, he said.

For hardman actor Peter Mullan skirt wearing has become a speciality
recently, whether as a kilted clansman or a homosexual in a gem of a
production for BBC2, as Allan Laing discovers
PETER Mullan sounds rough. Either someone has taken a sheet of
particularly course sandpaper to his vocal chords or he'd been out on
the skite the previous night. The latter, as it turns out, is the case
-- a gay-and-hearty with the cast and crew from the Tron Theatre's
adaptation of Janice Galloway's The Trick is to Keep Breathing.
Somewhat worryingly, the Glasgow actor has taken to wearing skirts of
late. ''A bit bloody late in life to start cross-dressing,'' he remarks,
wryly. However, the apparel is in the line of duty; all for the sake of
his craft. He plays a woman (straight up) in Breathing; a kilted
Highlander in Braveheart, and a homosexual artist in Ruffian Hearts.
It is David Kane's Ruffian Hearts on which we choose first to dwell in
conversation. Shown tonight as part of BBC2's Love Bites trilogy of
films, it is an absolute gem of a movie. Warmly received at this year's
Edinburgh Film Festival, it possesses a wonderful feel-good quality but
never lapses into over-sentimentality. It's set in contemporary Glasgow
and intertwines the stories of eight people, a disparate group of uppers
and downers all in search of that most elusive of life's treasures --
emotional attachment.
Kane, who wrote it (with no small measure of wit) and directed it
(with an abundance of style), is one of Scotland's great hopes for the
future. T'was he who penned the shamefully under-rated Dundee-set
thriller series Jute City (in which Mullan featured) for BBC Scotland a
few years back. He also wrote the tough six-part serial Finney for ITV
(which David Hayman directed).
Ruffian Hearts is much warmer, far more human and personal, than his
previous television work. It features an ensemble cast which includes
Mullan, Vicki Masson, Maureen Beattie, Clive Russell, Ewan Bremner, Paul
Blair, Bronagh Gallagher, Jenny McCrindle, and Billy McElhaney.
Peter Mullan plays Chez, a weary and mildly eccentric figure who
shares a flat with fellow art student Peter (Paul Blair). Chez is a
snarling cynic who continually ridicules his flat-mate, particularly
when the younger lad introduces his new girlfriend. It is an outstanding
comic performance.
''I thought the script was smashing and the fact that Davie Kane was
directing it as well really attracted me. He's the kind of guy who's
willing to let actors act. And then there was the fact that this
character was so obviously a closet gay which was really exciting.
''The great thing about Davie was that he wasn't precious about his
script -- but he'd tell you if he thought your lines were crap,'' he
says.
Mullan is a tough and uncompromising talent. A hard man who doesn't
mess about. The antithesis of the luvvie-darling theatrical type. He
lives, not in Glasgow's West End Actorland, but in a tenement flat in
Govanhill. It was while gazing out the window at his back court that he
was inspired to write Fridge, a 20-minute film which he also directed.
It is, without a doubt, the strongest of this year's batch of Tartan
Shorts.
Fridge is a stark, claustrophobic, and desperate slice of social
realism, riddled with the language of the gutter. But, in the
circumstances, that's allowed because the gutter is where it is set.
A wee boy, playing in the back court, gets locked in a discarded
fridge. His only potential rescuers are two homeless drunks. The film,
shot in gritty monochrome, captures perfectly the sense of frustration
and hopelessness. Mullan sees it as an allegory, with the whole world
looking down from its window on this tragedy unfolding. He deliberately
confined the shooting to the back court (his own back court), knowing
full well that if you moved it out, even to the street beyond, you would
lose the structure of the piece.
He could have tempered the language -- but he didn't. As it stands, it
will have to be broadcast separately from its companion Tartan Shorts.
Which is not a problem for Mullan.
''It was never made for television. When BBC Scotland saw it they said
that we were looking at a graveyard slot because of the language. But I
don't care because I don't think short films make an impact on
television. You don't rush home to see a 20-minute movie. I deliberately
made it for the cinema -- to be shown before a big movie. I'm very
grateful to BBC Scotland for paying for it but I couldn't care less
whether they showed it on television or not.
''This bad language thing is absurd. With Ruffian Hearts we were told
that we could have five 'f***s' and so many 'bastards'. That was the
ruling,'' he said.
And yet Mullan remains genuinely appreciative of the drama department
at BBC Scotland. He recalls that, not so long ago, it started and ended
with Peter MacDougall. Now he is impressed with the plurality of the
work which is coming out of Scotland.
''Writers and actors are coming from different backgrounds and they're
all taking a completely different approach. Glasgow is an exciting place
for actors right now. There is a whole new atmosphere. I think we're all
getting much cockier than we used to be. And that's no bad thing. It
won't happen this year and maybe not next year but pretty soon Glasgow
is going to be the place to be,'' he says.
Fridge features a powerful performance from Vicki Masson as one of the
two drunks, a character far removed from the role she plays in Ruffian
Hearts which, in turn, was far removed from her part in Rob Roy (the
ill-fated servant girl with whom arch-villain Tim Roth had his wicked
way). And all of that within the space of a year. Here's a young actress
in no danger of becoming stereotyped.
In Ruffian Hearts she plays Marie, an unhappy young woman who works in
a nightclub and who is at the tail-end of a relationship with a married
man (he's promised to leave his wife once too often). She said: ''It is
a wonderful character. Here is a woman in her twenties who's fed up with
life and fed up with men, and there's her mother (Maureen Beattie) in
exactly the same position.
''The way David Kane has written it, you can imagine people saying all
these things. And you don't get that all the time when you read a
script. The writing is so clear. I could identify with it. I've been
miserable. Everyone goes through periods when they feel that their
relationship is not too great,'' she said.

THE old chestnut that there are lies, damned lies, and statistics
cannot be applied to the Church Census published this week by the
National Bible Society and Christian Research Association. As Steve
Bruce pointed out in his sociological analysis of the results in this
newspaper, people are not usually accused of lying when they admit
adverse statistics about their organisation.
Besides, the results of the census simply confirmed what most people
who know anything about churches knew already -- that numbers in
mainstream, traditional denominations have been undergoing a steady
decline and that the biggest absentees are to be found among the young
and the middle-aged. However, despite some growth among independent
churches, the big battalions of the Kirk and the RC church still command
81% of the attendance in Scotland (a slippage of 3% from the situation
in 1984).
It was no surprise to learn that Aberdeen and region were less
diligent than the rest of Scotland in church attendance, but I smiled to
see the way in which the old Edinburgh/Glasgow rivalry is reflected in
the figures. Edinburgh could muster over 20,000 people at the Kirk (over
46% of the churchgoing population) with RCs down at 10,000, whereas in
Glasgow it was the opposite story with 50,000 at mass (over 60% of the
churchgoing population) and the Kirk could claim only just over 20%.
This census is certainly not the death knell of churchgoing. The
much-vaunted churchgoing of the Victorian era could muster only 33%
church attendance in 1851. With all the secularisation which has gone on
in the past generation the fact that one in seven Scots (14%) are in a
church on Sunday is still a significant figure. As Bishop Devine of
Motherwell cannily pointed out, the 745,000 who were in church on the
morning of the census in October 1994 contrasts somewhat favourably with
the 100,000 who clustered in football grounds the previous day.
The census results are published as a book, Prospects for Scotland
2000 (#14.99), and as well as tables of statistics, this contains a
fascinating essay by the NBS Secretary Rev Fergus Macdonald. A Free Kirk
minister who has won many friends across the denominational spectrum, he
tackles the difficult question of why the churches are so comparatively
ineffective in spite of increased efficiency. His answer comes in the
form of seven questions which derive from Stephen Covey's bestselling
manual for business executives, The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People.
He contends that it has as much to say to the voluntary sector as to the
corporate sector. I will let you judge for yourselves with my potted
version of his potted version of Covey.
1. Leadership: Are we proactive? -- in other words, people who make
things happen rather than wait for them to happen. The former love as a
verb, the latter experience love as a feeling. Proactive people make
choices based on values, while reactive people allow their conditions to
control them and are often left feeling powerless. Local churches often
appear to be waiting for things to happen rather than making them
happen.
2. Vision: Do we begin with an end in mind? Management is doing things
right, but real leadership consists of doing the right things. It is
living out of imagination rather than out of our memories. Why don't we
spend as much time devising dreams for the churches of Scotland as we do
inventing our anxieties?
3. Management: Are we putting first things first? Good management is a
way of focusing on relationships and results rather than on time and
method. It involves priorities, organisation, and planning which sets
and agrees goals. Some may see this as supplanting the role of the Holy
Spirit in the church but the answer to this is summed up in the two
slogans: If you fail to plan, you plan to fail; If you aim at nothing
you'll be sure to hit it.
4. Fraternity: Do we think Win/Win? By this is meant the form of
co-operation which works for the mutual benefit of all. It contrasts
with Win/lose (I get my way, you don't); Lose/win (I've lost out);
Lose/lose (two determined egos in conflict and mutual spoiling); Win
(grabbing advantage and leaving others to pick up on their position).
This approach applies both at the inter-personal and denominational
level.
5. Communication: Do we seek first to understand and then be
understood? This approach advocates empathetic listening along the lines
of the Greek characteristics: ethos (personal integrity &amp; credibility);
pathos (capacity for feeling); logos (reasoning). We are unlikely to
convince anyone of the merit of our logos who doubts our ethos or
pathos.
6. Partnership: Do we practise synergy? Synergy values differences
because it treats them as complementary means to the end. It differs
from compromise which minimises differences because it makes virtue of
diversity. Applied to individuals or denominations it results in the
whole being greater than the sum of the parts.
7. Renewal: Do we take time to sharpen the saw? This derives from the
wasted energy of the woodcutter who does not take time out of his
routine work to prepare the tools for the task. By this is meant
attending to the four dimensions of renewal -- physical, mental, social,
and spiritual.
Thus endeth the seven questions. Dare I suggest that their emphasis on
the positive might be more persuasive than religious teaching which
relies on commandments which begin ''Thou shalt not'' . . ?

TODAY'S young 'uns. Half of them want it to be 1965, before they were
born. Half of them don't know what century it is. And first let's go
back into the future with Cast, a melodic, mop-topped Merseybeat
four-piece in the dear old Beatlist Anglo-pop tradition.
Adored on Thursday night by a blokely stage-front scrum of teenagers,
Cast are propelled by a Ringoid drummer, and sport lots of gutsy
jingle-jangle guitar-interplay. They are led by John Power, once of the
long-lost La's. John is a singer with a catarrhal Scouse edge to his
voice and a face which marks him out as Gerry Marsden's great-grandson.
Cast have 50 minutes' worth of punchy three-minute songs, most of
which are enlivened by Lennonesque nasal vocal harmonies. Yet only one
song, Alright, imprints itself on my memory. I exit, grieving for the
La's and worrying about the rebellious rock'n'roll credentials of a band
whose merchandise features their label's corporate logo, Polydor, as
prominently as Cast's does.
Across the city a couple of hours later the two Chemical Brothers
stand at their keyboards, unleashing a tribal sonic mash-up of looped
drum-breaks and relentless rhythms. It is very loud. Glasgow's hard-eyed
acid-ned posse are out in force. They form themselves into a pulsing
dance-organism.
It is very hot. My mind wanders. The heat. The pounding metallic
racket. We could be in a foundry, I think to myself. Yes! A
post-industrial sound-foundry in which the lumpen non-workers have
united to rattle the shackles which oppress them in 4/4 time, thus
signalling their intention to overthrow capitalism! Or not. Sometimes I
think I think too much.

Theatre
IN the beginning there were two. Under the wily guidance of team
supremo Philip Differ they prospered and brought the gospel of Planet
Football to the peoples of Scotland. And how we loved them for it.
But the passage of time brought Freedom of Contract and the departure
of Tony Roper. Confined by the strictures of the Taylor Report, the wily
Differ delivered from among the riches of his youth policy Lewis MacLeod
and Greig Hemphill. Thus was Only An Excuse '95 born.
Do we love them, though? On the evidence of this opening night, yes we
do.
Jim and Gerry, Dennis and Derek, Rob McLean in person, welcome home.
Pant-wetting moments? Yes indeedy, and aplenty.
Brian Laudrup, you are a fraud! No doubts about that. Is master
puppeteer Gerry Anderson working on the Shoot show with Tommy Craig and
Charlie Nicholas? Would explain a lot. And Frank McAvennie, you were
magnificent. Can silence ever again be so eloquent.
Carping comments?
Well . . . occasionally the young lads allowed their voices to slip
out of character; movement on and off stage could have been slicker; and
while the gag-a-second script was outstanding, it was, at the end of the
day when all is said and done, perhaps a tad long.
But these are the words of a churl. With the flaccid tragedy of
Scotland's Euro Championships, one question remains. When, oh when, will
Craig Brown give these boys a chance on grass?

PAT KANE suprised me by his dissidence when interviewing Germaine
Greer on the Usual Suspects (Radio Scotland) this week. Her mammoth
contradiction and highly professional deflections were politely left off
the hook. This might have to do with the fact that they were speaking in
front of a live, highly appreciative audience -- she was playing to them
and talking to him and it might have seemed churlish, rather than
astute, to muscle in between the anecdote and the laughter. The straight
man must not become Jonathan Miller.
Greer has always self-consciously and flamboyantly won against the
flow as much against the women's movement as against patriarchy, not
always in a laudably independent way, but rather as one who, as a high
priestess, held a vested interest in disagreeing with the commoner's
line on things.
So in time where it would be difficult to find the feminist, from Fay
Weldon to Juliet Mitchell, who declared simplistically anti-male, in a
period in which the accusation of man-hating is viewed as the paltry
taunt on an unsophisticated misogynist, Greer declares that she is
indeed anti-male: that she positively dislikes men.
I bet in the sixties and seventies she would have claimed to being
misunderstood had she been accused of such a thing. But now everybody is
doing it. The image she used was unconvincing and old-fashioned sounding
when she talked of these ridiculous creatures ''blubbering over their
golf balls''.
She declined to fully pick up on a question which involved Camille
Paglia -- like Dame Edna hearing the name of another superstar, the
deflection was swift.
She was quite funny about her marriage's demise, how she had found, on
the night of her departure, the sight of Shepherd's Bush tube station a
thing of great beauty compared to the sight she had left.
Of course, her audience warmed to the story because people can easily
relate to the comic relief of extricating themselves from a
soul-destructive set-up.
But linking this to a general diatribe against the institution in
which a person is miserably duped into a bogus responsibility for the
happiness of another and has, poor fool, denied him/herself the Higher
Greer State of Being Free is wearisome and dated.
''Like no-one owns anyone else's body, man.'' That used to be said a
lot when accusations of cheating were made. Now, they're more likely to
say ''Oh God, was it the itemised phone bill, darling?''.
What is so inconsistent, if that truly is her anti-marital stance,
rather than her personal choice, is her then turning on the non-married
with children, those perpetrators of dangerous permissiveness, and
accuse them of embittering a generation, and worse, causing them to
sleep in doorways. ''They are mad at us,'' she emphasised.
Are we then to understand that had she borne a child to that frightful
first and only husband, she would not have banged the front door but
stayed home and denied herself forever that liberating vision of
Shepherd's Bush?
Ruby Tuesday, in a seemless twinkling, became a 57-year-old Saffy from
Ab Fab, and, one supposes in the midst of the hate, she now feels pity
for men because they will not gain by the wonderful release from sexual
desire brought on by the menopause. Well, lucky old us, when we're older
I thought.
The menopause is really God's gift to womanhood, releasing us from
yearning. And infibulation, contrary to the facts exposed in last week's
Women Of the World programme, can be seen in another light, from a first
world perspective, as a badge of courage, and an aesthetic improvement.
(And, best of all, all the other feminists are opposed to it.)

YOUR bold leader, Paying lip service (September 28), will not endear
you to many, but it is courageous to say the least. Although I am a
member of the so-called ''independent'' churches (LDS/Mormon) I
occasionally attend services of the ''established'' church and feel a
sense of despair for the evident lack of support.
I too have wondered if the cause of decline is not so much that the
people resent clear and honest direction but that their leaders may be
shrinking from the clarity and honesty that is needed.
Perhaps there is a fear among some religious leaders of a return to
the hypocrisy and injustices often associated with religious zeal. Such
fears may have led these same leaders to duck and weave in an effort to
court popularity which, like all fads, never lasts and rarely satisfies.
Along with all committed Christians who want a more caring and secure
society, I have a genuine interest in seeing all churches increase their
influence in the community, rather than the reverse.
Membership and attendance numbers in my own church are small enough
not to impact on the census figures yet, but there is steady growth on
both fronts.
Any committed Christian will attest the fact that the message of
Christ will deliver realistic hope and optimism for individuals and
society. The corollary, however, is that the same message, if it is to
succeed, demands individual sacrifice and involvement. In the words of a
nineteenth-century sage, ''a Church that makes no demands on its people,
has not the power to save them''.

Music
STRICTLY speaking, it's inaccurate to call the group that gave the
concert at the RSAMD last night the Leda Trio. To be pedantic about it
(and bring in a bit of Irish arithmetic), it was really two-thirds of
the Leda Trio plus one. Regular cellist Kevin McCrae was missing from
the line-up, and pianist Kate Thompson and violinist Peter
Campbell-Kelly were joined by Brian Schiele on viola, which thus opened
up a different area of the Leda repertoire for a night.
Not only different, but unusual, in its combination of instruments.
Two works in a mixed programme featured all three instruments together.
The first, Schumann's Fairy Tales, a set of four miniatures that
depicted both sides of the (disintegrating) Schumann persona, were not
exactly top-drawer stuff -- at least not in this performance, which
didn't fully catch their flavour. Best was the third, a typically dreamy
little piece. Worst was the last with an irritatingly insistent rhythmic
pulse (rather heavy handedly dealt with).
The other trio piece, by Khatchaturian, attempted (bravely) to
compensate with colour and rhythmic excitement for what it lacked in
thematic substance. Pleasant enough to listen to -- with a strong,
folk-like, and almost rhapsodic turn to its nature -- it was despatched
with fire by the group, but the piece literally ran out of steam,
petering out inconclusively at the end.
Otherwise it was duo pieces: Prokofiev's lovely Cinq Melodies for
violin and piano, shot through with characteristic whimsy, and a touch
of quirkiness (Campbell-Kelly's playing seemed a bit undernourished);
and one of Mozart's taxing and clever little Duos for violin and viola
(no hiding place here for any slips in intonation).
Best of the night was Brian Schiele's highly effective performance of
Britten's Lachrymae, a brilliantly enigmatic piece which occupies a
mysterious, twilight zone of expression. Same programme tomorrow at the
Queen's Hall.

AS an ex-member and elder of the Church of Scotland I am surprised
that the drop in membership is not greater.
In my experience too much time and effort is spent on raising money
for a largely unnecessary, inefficient, and at times hypocritical
headquarters.
The growth in independent church membership I would suggest is partly
because they are just that -- independent.
The Rev Fergus Macdonald is correct (September 28). It is time the
establishment is given less of a priority and more effort is spent in
bringing the Kirk back to being a centre of deep spirituality.
This may be too much of a challenge and less ''fun'' for legal and
politically minded ministers. If so they should leave. I am sure the
Church would prosper by their absence.

Music
NOT quite Byzantine, but the ornate mosaic, marble, and gilt
neo-Baroque interior of St Aloysius' church was nonetheless an
appropriate choice of venue for this performance of sacred Russian music
by the Kiev Chamber Choir.
Tchaikovsky, a declared non-believer, freely confessed to regular
church visits purely for the emotional charge of experiencing the
Orthodox liturgical chant in opulent architectural surroundings. The
Kiev Choir in this the opening concert of their UK tour, provided plenty
of those spine-tingling sensations so avidly sought by Uncle Peter
Ilyich.
Excerpts from his own setting of the Liturgy of St John formed the
backbone of the first half, together with two pieces from Rachmaninov's
setting of the same liturgy.
For 40 minutes these finely matched voices wove gloriously pure
harmonies, the high soprano notes soaring to the vaulted transepts,
while the rich, warm bass sounds reverberated with the strength of an
organ pipe.
The arrival of interval activity served only to underline the
intensity of the musical experience that had gone before where rising
and falling patterns and rhythms induced a tangible hypnotic aura.
The second half began with the 10 male voices in Slavonic Chant
followed by samplings from a wide range of seventeenth to twentieth
century Russian composers. Moments of sublime serenity were contrasted
with such dramatic effects as pin-sharp silence cut from a huge
crescendo.
The spontaneous standing ovation given by the 150-strong audience was
a true reflection of the power of this performance.

THE editorial Paying lip service, a test of true Christianity
(September 28) was one of the worst I have seen in a so-called quality
newspaper.
Some of the true Christians who are possessed with a feeling of doom
and who will seize with a perverse delight the fact that Scotland is no
longer a Christian country, according to the editorial, is a doubtful
statement and well, I am sure, be called into question by the faithful.
The editorial goes on to castigate atheists who are, without
exception, a bad lot, but at least their delight is genuine, not
perverse, like some Christians.
However atheists like to grind the face of an enemy into the dust and
are as bad as the worst sort of nationalists. Who are these worst sort
of nationalists? No doubt there are some atheists among them and even
true Christians.
The arrogance with which all atheists are dismissed would indicate to
me a lack of tolerance on the part of whoever wrote the editorial and
the self-righteous of someone who has the mistaken belief that he or she
is a true Christian.
Some of the epithets, such as intellectually flaccid and vapid, used
in this woolly-minded editorial could equally be applied to its writer.
The unconscious humour of the last sentence, when the Christian
churches were compared to alcoholics and told to be honest about their
position, was appreciated.

THE pigs in Orwell's Animal Farm did better for the farm than the
accountants dictating policy are doing for our academic institutions.
The pigs never issued Quality Assurance Handbooks to the animals as
guides to academic excellence; they never required a Commitment to
Quality Assurance to keep the sties competitive; they did not lay down
procedures for staff development to fatten up the porkers.
They would have recognised these concepts as relevant to the
production line at Ford's but singularly inappropriate to the proper
running of a farm.
Not so the current crop of managers imposed as a new bureacracy in our
universities and educational institutions. Their mania for measuring
everything in terms of wholly irrelevant criteria has become a plague as
insidious as the Black Death. Their numbers and power keep increasing as
they find new ways of reducing academic staff.
Martin Baillie's letter (September 26) reveals further erosion of a
once valued function of a university.
As a statistician I needed a working knowledge of many scientific
disciplines in order to understand and interpret data from researchers
in developing areas -- biology, genetics, molecular biology, virology,
biochemistry, geology.
Over the years extension and adult education courses filled in
background information I needed, and gave opportunity of meeting and
coming to understand experts in these fields.
As a citizen I found courses in art, history, and literature
mind-expanding, both before and after retirement. Martin and Pat Baillie
led a tour of the art and historical treasures of Rome last year which
the 30-odd participants found wholly entrancing.
If such cultural activities are to be subjected to accreditation to
satisfy the managers' obsession with their concept of value for money
the day of the Philistine is surely upon us.

THERE'S something about the phrase ''family entertainment'' that makes
the skin crawl like damp wallpaper. Perhaps it's the suggestion of smug
virtue and suburbia, some chintzy dream of Tony Blair's, as though mum,
dad, and the 2.4 were always and everywhere gathered at the fireside
impatient to feel good about themselves.
Perhaps, too, it's because ''family entertainment'' is always, in
every circumstance, vitiated utterly by the intolerance that
unadulterated niceness brings. And perhaps (my own favourite) it is
because the phrase is everywhere taken as sure and certain justification
for any piece of garbage oozing from the box like a hallucinogenic
sludge.
Whatever the reason, day-time television is a national disgrace.
It is as though the real watershed is at 6pm. Before that hour the
''housewives'' and the kiddies can be left safely unattended with pretty
moving pictures that will do nothing to excite their simple minds and
everything to convince them that theirs is a narrow, unchanging and
essentially puerile world.
Weekends are different, of course. Then the breadwinner is at home for
his Saturday sport and his serious Sunday political discussions. The
grown-up stuff. The matters of consequence. Men's business. Wait, as
that terrible old American sit-com used to say, until your father gets
home.
What makes all this interesting is the apparent assumption, not least
among schedulers, that anyone who will watch what they put out during
the day probably doesn't deserve to be taken seriously in the first
place.
If they watch this, runs the insult, they are not the sort to worry
their heads about deeper issues, least of all sexism and elitism. That
day-time TV is a cross between Hello! and the People's Friend, an
incoherent mix of ''family'' magazines, cartoons, soaps and failed game
shows, merely serves to prove that its audience is as bovine as
schedulers think they are.
Yet it is plainly false to believe that the day-time audience
comprises only ''housewives'', children and senior citizens, or that
they have no greater interest in life than Karen and Mack's day in court
Knots Landing (BBC1, Monday). And if that suggestion seems insulting,
you plainly haven't endured Supermarket Sweep (ITV, daily), the most
revolting programme ever to confuse species and treat people like
chimps.
Perhaps, given that presenter Dale Winton's other brush with fame has
been the merely-execrable Pets Win Prizes, this isn't too surprising.
Having spotted a gap in the Russell Harty, camp-but-cuddly market, yet
lacking the late interviewer's wit, Winton presides over this homage to
Pavlovian consumerism like a man who cannot believe his luck.
The ''game'', such as it is, involves answering a few dumb questions,
running around the studio with a supermarket trolley, and running up the
biggest notional bill possible. Thus set up for the day, ''housewives''
across the land will presumably be equipped to field a few dumb
questions, run around with a supermarket trolley, run up some bills, and
believe there is nothing strange or oppressive about their lives. After
all: they saw it on TV.
Supermarket Sweep is the worst of day-time television but it is not
the only atrocity. ''Family'' and ''entertainment'' are hard-wired into
the schedules, enshrined in the anodyne chatter of Richard and Judy This
Morning (ITV daily), replicated in Neighbours and Home and Away (family
entertainment is watching other families) or celebrated in cookery
shows, animal shows and the odd, lightly-educational documentary. If TV
is a mirror, we are all slightly cracked.
Then again, there are times when TV reflects nothing much more than
itself. Chapter and Verse (Channel 4, Wednesday), went out at midnight,
perhaps because someone decided it was too strong for ''housewives'',
perhaps because it was realised that an apologia for the Glasgow
gangster Paul Ferris had been appallingly mishandled.
Despite the presence of John McVicar, who ought to know what he is
talking about, this theatrical, true-crime presentation, complete with a
Jailhouse Rock set, ''dramatised reconstructions'' and closed-circuit
footage, was a piece of myth-making.
This was not because anything said by or about Ferris was notably
untrue, but rather because of what seemed like a deliberate attempt to
glamorise, even to justify, a violent, vain young man. Macho tosh
dressed up, in other words, as a plea in mitigation.
Unmitigated, as disasters go, and proof that not all the rubbish
escapes during daylight hours, was last week's Mondo Rosso: Blood and
Guts (Friday, BBC2), featuring Jonathan Ross and his two favourite
subjects: bad movies and Jonathan ''Rosso'' Ross.
Even the presence of Eddie Izzard -- whose previous determination to
avoid TV turns out to have been justified -- could save this lame and
lamentable excursion around the star's ego. With a new look -- one that
said ''Don't touch with a bargepole'' -- and the old excuse that rotten
films are somehow made acceptable by post-modernist irony, this thing
wasted time and space with real enthusiasm. Never again.
It is a thought that Robert Harris might echo. I spent most of
Omnibus: Enigma -- The Making of a Hardback Hero (BBC1, Monday)
wondering whether the author of Fatherland was incredibly brave or
incredibly narcissistic to thus expose himself to a documentary crew
while afflicted by writer's block and with the entire publishing
industry, or so it was alleged, awaiting his next, long overdue novel.
As is customary with such pieces, it told us little about the process
of writing -- perhaps because Harris was finding the process so
difficult -- and rather too much about ''research'', otherwise known as
the fine art of procrastination. The novelist seemed uncomfortable much
of the time, as well he might have, what with the billowing oceans of
hype surrounding him.
Yet the real point of the piece was inadvertent: analysing the hype,
Omnibus yet again became part of the hype. Did that make it any better
than Melvyn Bragg's typical shallow South Bank Show interview with Tom
Sharpe (ITV, Sunday) which appeared -- such a coincidence -- just as the
writer's first book in 12 years was being published? I beg leave to
doubt it.
Once upon a time writers faced no such humiliations. Jane Austen, for
one, has been allowed 182 years before her latest trial by television.
That said, Pride and Prejudice (BBC1, Sunday), deserves something more
than instant judgment, and we shall return to it.
At first sight, however, there seems more fuss than substance to this
adaptation by Andrew Davies, comedy an inch too broad and a certain
self-regard that has become the vice of almost all BBC costume dramas.
Is this Austen or Davies? More after the break.

READING the article on Charles Harkins's book about Green's Playhouse
(Weekend Extra, September 23) brought back many delightful and romantic
memories. My experience of it goes back to 1937, '38, and the first half
of '39. The big bands played there even at that time.
We were just beginning to emerge from the terrible soul-destroying
depression which made today's recessions look like paradise. To take a
girl to the luxurious Golden Divans with a box of chocolates was the
Glasgow equivalent of taking a New York girl to the Ritz.
However, it was the ballroom that caught my imagination. When I looked
out of one of the windows and saw the great height I was up, I really
felt I was dancing in the clouds.
Perhaps my most poignant memory of it was when I was billeted in a
frozen crevasse of a barn. It was January in the awful winter of 1940,
just outside the little French village of Plivot.
I had just received a letter from a girl I used to dance with. I sat
down on an old box to read it.
It was a nice cheerful letter, which ended by her saying: ''Annie and
I are going to a late night at the Playhouse, but this time you will
just have to sit and think about us'' -- and I did.
Suddenly, as if some Fairy Godmother had waved her magic wand, I began
to feel the warm glow of that delightful ballroom, the frozen barn was
transformed, and I was once again on that dance-floor.
Mary MacLean, that enchanting Hebridean girl from the Isle of Coll,
who danced like a dream, was in my arms as we danced to the music of the
band as it played Ray Noble's The Very Thought of You.
But I never saw Mary again, and that was the last time I danced in the
ballroom in the sky.

INCREASINGLY it looks as if the proposed start-up date for a single
European currency will not be met. The German Government effectively
made that point when its Finance Minister, Mr Waigel, expressed the view
that Italy would not at present meet the Maastricht criteria for
inclusion. Now a senior official of the Bundesbank has expressed the
opinion that hopes of a speedy introduction of the single currency after
1999 cannot be sustained. It is true that former German political and
financial leaders, Mr Schmidt and Mr Pohl, who led the country and the
Bundesbank respectively, have come out strongly in favour of the
original timetable; and so have the Commission in Brussels, but none of
that matters if those with responsibility for German financial policy
now disagree. That policy has, after all, been the most consistently
successful in Europe's experience since the 1950s: no-one should be
surprised that its contemporary managers do not want to risk it. German
public opinion, which would prefer the D-mark to anything else, cannot
be taken for granted.
Actually few member states could meet the Maastricht criteria at the
moment, and it is far from certain that two, or even four, years will be
sufficient time to make much difference. Enthusiastic would-be members
like Belgium and Spain do not qualify at present, and it may even be
doubtful if France would, though the French have made, and continue to
make, enormous sacrifices to do so. The Germans, surely, would not want
to leave them in the lurch. In a way which must seem ironic it looks
very much as if the UK would qualify, as its public debt is still set to
shrink. The Chancellor was jubilant about this yesterday, even to the
extent of expressing his content with florin as a possible name for the
new money. The bitter reaction of Sir Teddy Taylor was a reminder of how
deeply this matter still divides Tories, but it is difficult to dispute
the Government's line that it will enter new arrangements only if they
are felt to promote British interests. No-one would suggest entry in
other circumstances, but the fact is that the Chancellor and the Prime
Minister as well, probably, as a majority of their colleagues, believe
that the move would confer benefits. And, on this occasion, these would
flow to the UK from the start.
Any new arrangement must confer benefits on all who accept it. Almost
as important, those who cannot meet the criteria for membership must not
be too damaged by their exclusion. It cannot be to Europe's advantage as
a whole that its monetary arrangements effectively divide it in two, and
certainly not for long. As of now, any core which would meet the
Maastricht criteria would be small, three or four states rather than
even half. The criteria may be too strict but the Germans will not want
them relaxed. It must seem from a British perspective that the issue
which has proved to be so damaging to Conservative unity, and hence to
their electoral standing, is more academic than practical. Mr Clarke's
personal stance, his ebullience and self-confidence, are taken too
literally by his internal party opponents, who may also have been
over-impressed by the aspirations of Brussels rather than its ability to
meet them. There will eventually be a single European currency, but only
when the various national opinions are ready to endorse it. The first of
these opinions has to be German, given the status of the D-mark, but
other countries need to come to much the same conclusion. All will only
do so when they accept the same condition as our own Government that the
initiative be demonstrably to their advantage.

I WOULD be most grateful for the opportunity of correcting a remark
attributed to me in the report about the forthcoming decision of the
European Court of Justice on the legality of football transfer fees
(September 28).
The report misquotes me as stating that the ruling of the Court will
require the agreement of all member states of the European Union at next
year's Inter-Governmental Conference. The European Court of Justice is
in fact independent of the other institutions of the European Union.
However, if the Court endorses the Advocate General's opinion that
transfer fees after expiry of contract are in breach of the Treaty of
Rome, then the only way to overturn the effect of the ruling within the
European Union would be to introduce an appropriate amendment to the
Treaty.
Any such amendment would require the agreement of all 15 member states
at an Inter-Governmental Conference.
I trust that this helps to clarify the situation.

North West Water announced yesterday that it owned 11.7% of Norweb
after raising its bid for the regional electricity company serving
Manchester and North-west England.
The Takeover Panel ordered Norweb to advise its shareholders by Monday
what they should do about the #1720m offer.
North West came back for a second bite at Norweb on Thursday within
hours of Norweb announcing that it had recommended a rival #1700m joint
bid by Houston Industries and Central South West of the United States.
The market is waiting for Houston and CSW to raise their own bid.

SCOTTISHPOWER'S hostile #1100 takeover bid for Manweb appears
virtually unstoppable following the collapse of talks between Manweb and
the US power company PacifiCorp on a rival offer.
''I think it is unlikely that anyone else will enter the fray now and
we are certainly recommending that Manweb shareholders should accept
ScottishPower's cash and paper offer,'' said Ian Graham, electricity
analyst at NatWest Securities in Edinburgh.
ScottishPower leapt back into the market yesterday, buying more Manweb
shares as they tumbled 24p at one point before closing 16p down at 998p.
The company boosted its stake in the Chester-based utility by 2.1% to
19.4%.
ScottishPower chief executive Ian Robinson was clearly pleased by
Manweb's announcement that its talks with an overseas ''white knight''
had collapsed, but he remained wary of further surprises.
''Nothing is ever plain sailing until you get there, but we are
confident. It is a good step forward for us,'' he said as ScottishPower
shares gained 6p to 352p.
Acceptances of the ScottishPower bid must be submitted by 1pm next
Friday, but Manweb chief executive John Roberts vowed go down fighting.
''The ScottishPower offer is certainly a very mean bid and we will
continue to press our case with the institutions,'' he said.''I do not
believe in throwing in the towel when I have got right on my side.''
Mr Roberts declined to identify the overseas company with which Manweb
held 10 days of negotiations to stall the ScottishPower bid, but other
Manweb officials confirmed reports that it was PacifiCorp, a
medium-sized US power company based in Portland, Oregon.
Mr Roberts said the white knight had been willing to make a
''significantly higher'' offer than ScottishPower's cash-plus-shares
bid, currently worth 1004p, with an all-cash alternative of 990p.
But he said the potential challenger was scared off by fears that
ScottishPower would top its own proposed bid in the region of 1050p to
1100p per share.
The deal collapsed on Thursday as North West Water struck back with a
higher offer to outbid two US power companies for Norweb, a regional
electricity company (REC) which distributes power in Manchester and
northwest England.
''I think the reason the talks collapsed was basically the situation
that was taking place in Norweb,'' Mr Roberts said.
He insisted that Manweb's proposed package of shareholder benefits
worth 550p offered better value than ScottishPower's offer, but added
that Manweb was still open to approaches from other suitors about an
agreed takeover bid.
We are always willing to talk to anybody who puts an offer on the
table that fully values the company,'' Mr Roberts said.
PacifiCorp may never have been serious about bidding for Manweb, even
though it has publicly expressed interest in buying a UK REC.
Many analysts believe that it was simply taking advantage of Manweb's
plight to look through its books and get information that would help it
to make a cheaper uncontested bid for another small REC -- possibly
South Wales Electricity or Seeboard.
''My view is that they were just in there to find out how much the
business was worth in order to go and bid for another REC,'' said Andrew
Stone, utilities analyst at Daiwa Securities in London.
For Manweb, on the other hand, the talks were a useful stalling tactic
that pushed up the price of its shares and prevented ScottishPower from
buying them on the open market for nearly two weeks.
''We are annoyed in the sense that this has been a great delaying
tactic for them,'' fumed one ScottishPower official. ''We are a week
behind schedule in getting the shareholders on our side.''
Ian Graham at NatWest said it would have been costly for PacifiCorp to
put in a bid for Manweb without being reasonably sure of success.
''Just to press the button would cost you a few million pounds. Less
than #10m, but probably more than #5m,'' he said.

THE average citizen must wonder why conservationists, in a world of
human tragedy, are engaging in such heated debate over a duck (September
26). It is not helped by some bird-lovers using the term ethnic
cleansing to describe the attempts by wildfowl biologists to reduce or
eliminate the UK population of ruddy ducks.
Lady Philippa Scott did not speculate as to how her husband, the late
Sir Peter Scott, might feel about the proposed slaughter of the British
population of up to 4000 ruddy ducks. She would know better than anyone,
but I suspect he would be very uneasy, to say the least; his
autobiography led me to believe that he regretted his earlier days as a
duck-hunter.
What many bird-lovers and naturalists do not realise is that behind
the scenes conservationists in this country are strongly divided over
this issue. It is a major turning point in conservation ethics and many,
including myself, feel that the ruddy-duck working group is treading a
dangerous path.
In fact, we would prefer to allow the ruddy and white-headed ducks to
interbreed in Spain rather than resort to such severe control measures.
Surprisingly to some, the RSPB takes the opposite view and supports the
killing.
The approach of the eco-purists is short-term; evolution does not work
that way. Hybridisation over a period of time may lead to the demise of
the white-headed duck as we know it, but would ultimately result in a
new species which is no less ecologically adapted to conditions.
The injection of ruddy-duck genes can be viewed as the species, or
super-species, or whatever the biologists like to call it, having access
to a larger gene pool. The genetic difference between the two birds is
likely to be slight, anyway.
This is a classic case of man interfering to an unacceptable degree in
the course of nature. OK, he caused the problem in the first place, so
he should learn from it and endeavour to avoid similar mistakes. The
solution proposed by the RSPB among others, to shoot large numbers of a
duck which is widely loved by their supporters, is ethically
questionable.
Incidentally, any readers who would like to see the delightful bird in
question need go no further than Coatbridge. The principal Scottish
haunt of the ruddy duck is Woodend Loch, part of Drumpellier Country
Park. The loch currently supports over 50 individuals, including some
recently hatched ducklings. Don't tell the RSPB!

THE campaign for US presidential elections seems to get earlier and
earlier. It has certainly been underway early in this cycle since
everyone assumed that President Clinton, who has been a disappointing
President, would not be capable of re-election. Suddenly that perception
has changed and it may have done so because the President has switched
his focus of concern from domestic affairs to the wider world. At home
his policies have failed and been seen to have failed: Mr Clinton does
not have the clout required for radical domestic reform. It is not just
that entrenched interests (for example the medical profession) oppose
him, but that the whole climate of middle-class American opinion, the
vast majority of the country, is hostile to the collectivist direction
in which reform would have to move. Mr Clinton failed to change the
public mood, and it may even have moved against him as the mid-term
election swing to the Republicans showed. Yet even their fortunes have
not proved to be stable, and they have not yet shown that they possess a
potential presidential candidate who can be relied upon to beat Mr
Clinton.
It is too soon to say that they cannot do so. Quite apart from General
Powell who is still in the wings, they may yet turn up a potential
winner: the long course of primary elections has the effect of winnowing
candidates and pinpointing the vote-getters. Yet already people are
unhappy with front-running Senator Dole whose appeal is limited; and
General Powell may be too light for a political role. If that all
remains to be seen, what is sure is that Mr Clinton is enjoying a run of
success in foreign affairs and that is having an effect on his national
standing. The Bosnian situation looks as if it is coming right and the
American role in pushing it that way is indisputable. That is true also
of the Middle East; even in Northern Ireland the United States has been
working to further the peace process, and has had some success. In his
relations with China, too, Mr Clinton is enjoying good fortune,
something felt to be important by American opinion which foresees
China's major role in the world in the coming century.
It must seem ironic that this foreign policy dimension, which Mr
Clinton derided when it was bestrode by Mr Bush, has come so
dramatically to his rescue. It seems to be the fact all the same, and it
will allow the President, widely acknowledged to be a clever campaigner,
to project a positive image in the months ahead. Of course that is not
his sole advantage -- he is the incumbent, and remains the President
during all the campaigning and even after it until the inauguration in
the January following the actual voting. This circumstance should never
be forgotten for it will allow him to do things when all other
candidates can only talk.
All of this accounts for the more buoyant mood among the President's
advisors and friends who are also drawing comfort from the way the
economy has continued to belie the worst fears and go on growing, if
modestly. Even the dollar has just staged a partial recovery in world
markets. All this means two things: next year's election will not be a
Republican walkover; and Mr Clinton must be the favourite to win it. Few
would have thought that a year ago.

The hunt is on for oil and gas in the northern Irish Sea, but Andy
Murray finds there are fears that birds could suffer a similar fate in
the Solway
ANY day now a huge rig will be tugged from Greenock into the strait
between Scotland and Northern Ireland to begin the offshore search for
hydrocarbons in the Solway basin.
British Gas has hired Global Adriatic XI, a drilling rig half the size
of a football pitch to sink the Laggantalluch well 2500 metres deep and
three kilometres off the Rhinns of Galloway.
Contrary to recent press reports, the company will not be daft enough
to drill within Beaufort's Dyke, Western Europe's largest munitions
dump. Liz Mortlock, media relations manager for British Gas Exploration
and Production, said: ''We have conducted a full and thorough survey
with television cameras and magnetic equipment, and we are completely
satisfied that there are no munitions within the rig site and that we
have done everything we can to make our operation there safe.''
Drilling will take place 5 kilometres from the dyke and 900 metres
from the designated dump area.
Environmentalists in South-west Scotand are more concerned about the
threat of an oil slick than they are about something sinister exploding
from its post-military grave.
Esso, British Gas, and Elf have all won licences for a total of 12
blocks in the North Irish Sea in the latest round awarded by the
Department of Trade and Industry.
Elf will home in on the Isle of Man. British Gas intends to start
drilling off the Rhinns at the beginning of October. Esso is considering
the results of seismic tests and may drill three wells between
Whitehaven and Wigtown next year.
Colmar Adriatic will almost certainly be used by Esso, and there are
fears of oil spillages from blowouts during refuelling.
Spokesmen for both British Gas and Esso emphasise that the greatest of
care has been taken to conduct major environmental surveys. They say
vessels will be at hand to deal with the ''extremely unlikely event of a
spillage''.
However, the Upper Solway is the second largest continuous area of
intertidal habitat in Britain and supports internationally important
numbers of wildfowl. Wigtown bay, which comes within Esso's orbit, holds
internationally important numbers of whooper swans, pink-footed geese
and greylag geese.
The Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust's Caerlaverock nature reserve further
into the Solway estuary but still at risk from any pollution, is
world-famous for its wintering wildfowl, notably the Spitsbergen
barnacle geese.
Its manager, John Docherty, said the WWT would have major concern if
oil or gas were extracted from an area so vulnerable to damage.
''Whatever the oil companies say, there would be environmental damage.
The Solway is relatively pristine, radioactive contamination
notwithstanding.
''There was a petition against the granting of any licences in the
Solway,'' Docherty said.
The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) is alarmed at the
prospects of gas or oil exploitation off the Rhinns, where it has two
nature reserves.
One of them, at the Mull of Galloway, accommodates guillemots,
razorbills, fulmars, shags and rare black guillemots. Scare Rocks
reserve, moreover, has the distinction of containing Scotland's
southernmost gannetry; it supports more than 1000 pairs.
''We are very concerned about any gas or oil exploration. We would
rather the licences had not been issued, but now we will have to see to
it that it is done under the most stringent environmental conditions,''
said Chris Rollie, a conservation officer with the RSPB.
''The Upper Solway supports 120,000 waterfowl and any oil spillage
could have a catastrophic effect on them. They are sinking a well four
miles from a reserve and we are concerned.''
Rollie also fears that drilling material such as bentonite and baryte
will be at the mercy of the swift tides.
He said: ''It has been proven that material can travel as far as 750
kilometres. We do not want to see fish spawning grounds affected.''
There has been talk of ''black gold'' in the Solway Firth for 30
years, but it would take a gambler with deep pockets to wager heavily on
South-west Scotland enjoying an oil or gas bonanza on the scale of
Aberdeen.
Oil companies generally put the probability of striking it lucky, that
is finding hydrocarbons which are commercially viable to exploit, at one
in five.
However, British Gas cites odds of 10-1 of discovering retrievable gas
in the North Channel.
The odds on the Solway following the North Sea as an arena for major
mineral exploitation are considerably longer.
Gordon Mann, director of physical planning for Dumfries and Galloway
Regional Council, has thoroughly researched oil exploitation, and he
speaks soberly of any development in the Solway.
In November the oil hunt will be the theme of the annual conference
held by South West Forum, a networking mechanism for community and
voluntary organisations in Dumfries and Galloway, Clydesdale and Cumnock
and Doon Valley.
Mann, a former planning director of Shetland Islands Council, will be
the keynote speaker, but he said that there will be no Dallas-style
boomtime for South-west Scotland. He will warn delegates that the search
may generate no benefits for Dumfries and Galloway at all.
Helicopter facilities will probably be confined to Blackpool or
another northern English town with an airport, he predicts. The only
harbour in Galloway suitable as a supply port is Cairnryan, although the
jetties would require considerable investment.
''Gas is more probable than oil, the companies say. If they did want
to land it in Scotland, an onshore terminal would be built, and there
would be 200-300 temporary jobs and up to 1000 in construction, with 50
permanent jobs,'' said Mann.
''But North-west England is looking more probable as a supply or
servicing base because of the existing terminals at Heysham, Barrow in
Furness and Blackpool.''
There is no proven existence of oil or gas in the Solway basin, but
the geological conditions are conducive. The sea is in the same strata
as Morecambe Bay, which has the second largest gas field on Britain's
Continental shelf.
Last year more than 1500 seabirds died off the Galloway coast after a
tanker flushed its ballast tanks. Dead birds littered the area as well
as the coasts of Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man. Only time will
tell whether disaster can strike again.

YOUR report on the dissatisfaction of the business community in
Tighnabruaich with the Argyll and the Islands Enterprise was a justified
and long suppressed cri de coeur.
In the first half of the seventies Tighnabruaich was industrially
raped. It was a short, sharp, and ugly experience. The eventually
aborted Portavadie project cost the nation #25m or thereabout but, more
importantly for those of us who live in the area, it obliterated the
established tourist trade which had sustained the community for over a
century.
When the industrial paraphernalia departed the business sector of the
community was left to conjure with bankruptcy and to muse why such
destruction did not warrant some form of compensation. None was
forthcoming. Naively, none was demanded. The village was simply broken
and abandoned.
Tighnabruaich was left in this perilous condition to face the events
of the eighties. The roller-coaster of a depression, inflation, and then
recession further undermined any possibility of hoped for recovery.
The imagination could not conceive that worse would follow, but it
did. The coup de grace was a London property collapse. Highland hotels
became worthless overnight, or so we were told by our bankers.
With our mental health surprisingly still intact, the nineties came
along and with it, praise be, the Enterprise quango to help to eradicate
our economic distress.
Quickly it became apparent that the AIE's brief was not the
alleviation of economic desperation but to spread anger and alarm by
adopting a consistent policy of waste by the simple process of pouring
public monies into the local sand.
Unarguably the AIE has offended the population of Tighnabruaich where
straightforward assistance is urgently required to rebuild our place in
Scottish tourism.
Britain's oil debt to Tighnabruaich must be honoured. It took tens of
millions of pounds to destroy this community. A fraction of that is
required for revitalisation.

PROFESSOR Steve Bruce asks, in the light of the Scottish Church
Census: ''Why do we still give large amounts of airtime to Thought for
the Day and Prayer for the Day?''
He misses two points: that equally important surveys reveal a high
proportion of the population to have a belief in God and an
understanding of spirituality; and that neither Thought for the Day on
Radio Scotland nor Prayer for the Day on Radio 4 is exclusively
Christian.
Representatives of Islam, Judaism, and Hinduism regularly contribute
to Thought for the Day on Radio Scotland and in the past year Scotland's
contributors to Prayer for the Day have included Buddhists, Jews,
Muslims, as well as Christians.
Not all those who recognise that there is a religious dimension to
life want to go to church.

POOR old Brian Wilson is getting rusty. There was a time when he used
to hit his chosen targets. Just for the record let me correct two of the
mistakes in his column (September 29).
First, I was not a member of the SNP delegation at the first meeting
of the Constitutional Convention in 1989. I am pretty certain that he
was not a member of the Labour delegation. Perhaps at that time memories
of his co-operation with the Tories against devolution in 1979 were
fresher than they are now.
Secondly, as all of the press reports made perfectly clear, my
comments about Councillor Jim Mitchell ''speaking from the heart''
referred to his conference call for peaceful direct action against
health service closures.
As anyone who knows him will understand Jim Mitchell has had more
reason than most of us to be grateful to the National Health Service and
his anger at the present situation is well understood. However, he would
be the first to be surprised to hear the suggestion from Brian Wilson
that I approve of the direction of his attack on our Unionist opponents.
Of course civil disobedience is something that Brian Wilson has
advocated himself. A few years ago when much of Scotland was squaring up
to the poll tax he refused to back that campaign. However, he did
advocate non-payment of dues for yachtsmen in the west coast of
Scotland, neatly bridging his own radical past with New Labour's appeal
to the middle classes.
As to the continuing Labour attempt to smear the SNP by linking us
with violence. I have searched through the archives and have come across
only one quotation from a prominent person which does cause me some
concern.
It came from a young student in the late 1960s and reads, ''If I felt
that direct action was the most likely method of obtaining freedom then
I would join the SRA or its equivalent''.The quotation's only interest
now is that the young student concerned has become the Labour MP for
Cunninghame North and is much given to pontificating about such matters.
I can confirm to Brian Wilson that if he were still a member of the
SNP and still expressing such silly views, then it would be my
unfortunate duty to expel him forthwith.

THE arrogant strut, the unmistakably Gallic features, and the
imperious expression, trademarks of the most controversial footballer in
Britain, will be on show again at Old Trafford tomorrow when Eric
Cantona, footballer extraordinaire and community service veteran, makes
his return to the football stage with Manchester United.
His comeback after eight months banishment from doing what he does
best will be the subject of much curiosity among those who wish to see
his eccentric outrages as well as the aficionados of the game who want
again to admire his brilliant talent.
That ''for and agin'' reaction has been the hallmark of public
appreciation of this deep and troubled spirit ever since he emerged from
the tranquillity of his family home, a glorious house perched high on
the hills of Caillols, overlooking Marseilles, into the professional
football spotlight. The man has been villain, hero, genius, rascal,
often on the same afternoon, but throughout his career he has exercised
enough charismatic magnetism to have induced forgiveness from a variety
of authoritarians who do not always show such tolerance.
Alex Ferguson, his manager at Manchester, has not been a tower of
patience throughout his own career, possessing a temper that has been
manifested in tea-cup throwing tantrums and dressing-room dressing-downs
that have had many a brawny bruiser seeking asylum, yet with this de
Gaulle-like figure the Scot has shown an astonishing paternal
protectiveness.
Ferguson, of course, has had a much closer look at the man's foibles
than anyone besides Cantona's immediate family, and perhaps has made
greater excuses for his flaws than he would for his own sons, but the
manager has no doubts at all about one aspect of the Frenchman; his
ability. ''He is undoubtedly the best footballer I have ever had in any
team of mine,'' he says.
That is a fair compliment from a man who has been in charge of some
great Aberdeen players, some pretty exciting Scotland international
players and a cosmopolitan Manchester United squad packed with
superstars of all nationalities.
Ferguson insists the Frenchman has taken his punishment and will not
falter again, at least not to the extent of hurtling himself at a
belligerent fan, as he did during a game at Crystal Palace on January
25, an act that resulted in his suspension from all football, a club
fine and a court appearance following which he was first sentenced to 14
days in prison then commuted to 120 hours comunity service.
It may be a pious hope, based on the Gallic player's track record to
date which, admittedly, had not quite stretched to Kung Fu attacks on
critics but contained a series of misdemeanours that clearly mark him as
something of a tantrum specialist in his own right.
In his book Cantona, My Story, translated from the French, he
describes how he became disillusioned with the manager of the French
national team, Henri Michel, and vented his frustration at being left
out of the squad in what might be considered robust style. The
translated version of his outburst, following a winning game for
Marseille at Strasbourg, was as follows: ''I will never play for France
again as long as Henri Michel is manager . . . he is one of the most
incompetent managers in world football. I am not far from thinking he is
a shitbag.''
This torrent came from a young man of 22 years, and lends startling
support to the lobby that has been long convinced that he is among the
leaders in the ''spoiled brat'' premier division. As a result, Cantona
was banned from playing for the national side for a year. He was later
suspended by Marseille for throwing his shirt down in disgust during a
friendly match in aid of charity, and while he was with Montpellier he
had a fight with a team-mate in the dressing room after a game and was
suspended for 10 days.
More was to follow as the enfant terrible of the French game meandered
through his parallel trails of glory and disgrace. Suspended by the
French league for a month after throwing the ball at the referee,
Cantona was so incensed by the punishment that he called in turn each of
the officials sitting in judgment ''an idiot'' and was promptly
suspended for a further month. It was time, he decided, to go elsewhere,
first to Leeds United, where at one point he was alleged to have spat on
a fan, and then to Manchester United.
He cost Manchester #1m after he had played his part in Leeds' first
championship win for 18 years and soon, as he had been with every club,
he was a cult figure. He had some magnificent performances for United as
they went on to win the title for the following two seasons, giving the
man whose fans concocted the chant ''Ooh Aah Cantona'' three successive
top division championship medals.
Ferguson still recalls the signing of the Frenchman with a tingle,
despite the problems that were to follow. As Leeds spoke to the
Manchester chairman on the phone inquiring about a player, Ferguson
wrote ''Eric Cantona'' on a piece of paper and showed it to his
chairman. Within quarter of an hour Leeds came back, the deal was agreed
and tied up the next day.
Since then the manager has been the player's staunchest defender,
accusing others of intimidation, occasionally keeping his silence when
he was expected to condemn his man publicly, yet even he will have to
concede defeat if the 29-year-old Cantona lets him down again.
There have been worrying moments even during the enforced exile, as
Cantona, who was also stripped of his captaincy by the French
international manager as a result of his attack on the Crystal Palace
fan, railed against the injustices he continues to perceive.
The fact that he signed a new three-year contract seemed to ensure
that he would see his time out with United, thus disappointing clubs
like Inter Milan who wanted to release his talents, temper et al, into
Italian Serie A football, but it did not deter him from threatening to
quit again a few months ago.
Eric the Red had been upset by the FA inquiry into what might have
been a breach of his suspension, when he played in a practice match
against Rochdale. The FA decided to take no action but by now the French
ire was on the rise and Eric demanded to be released from his contract.
Ferguson had to fly to France, soothe the fevered Gallic brow and
persuade him to honour his obligation to the Old Trafford fans who have
stood by him through it all.
Unlike most of his contemporaries, Cantona has a fondness for the arts
that was fostered by his father's love of painting in a purpose-built
room high in the hills of Caillols. It was his dad who took the young
Eric to the galleries where works by Pierre Ambrogiani were among his
favourites.
Poetry, however, became his passion off the field. In his book, he can
find no difference between the pass that Pele delivered to Carlos
Alberto in the 1970 World Cup final in Mexico and the poetry of Rimbaud.
The death of Ambrogiani in 1986 affected him deeply -- ''a page of my
childhood was turned''.
Is this the same man we have seen flying through the air with feet
flailing towards a spectator?
Enigmatic and impossible to decipher, Cantona has had so many chances,
so many apologists that it seems they, too, have been consumed by the
man's brilliance. In France he was an admirer of German star Franz
Beckenbauer, especially when he became manager of Marseille, but
thoroughly disliked Bernard Tapie, the multi-millionaire owner of the
club, and Beckenbauer's successor, Belgian Raymond Goethals.
Cantona may be a lover of colour and shade but it seems he sees people
in black and white.
The complexities of his character might also be illustrated by his
recent support of Diego Maradona, another world football star who has
been able to paint his own landscape of scandal in a glorious and yet
disappointing career.
Cantona, convicted for assault, backed Maradona, thrown out of the
World Cup for drug taking, in his founding of a world football union.
The combination may seem incongruous to some but not to the great prima
donnas of the people's game.
It is a strange yet apt coincidence that Maradona is about to return
after his own 15-month enforced exile following that World Cup scandal.
The great Argentinian will play for Boca Juniors against the South
Korean national side in Seoul today.
Twin heroes and rogues they may be, but Maradona does not attempt to
bamboozle the world with his perceived literacy, as Cantona did when he
emerged from court after his jail sentence had been altered to one of
community service. ''When seagulls follow a trawler it is because they
think sardines will be thrown in the sea,'' was his one and only
comment, leaving a trail of baffled hacks and snappers in much the same
way as he mystifies full-backs and centre-halfs.
Eric the Gaul, who has been keeping himself busy by making a film in
his native country, has vowed he will not get into trouble again; the
football world will hope fervently that he will be able to resist the
intimidation by opposition fans, whose invective will reach new heights
in the hope of inducing him to fresh excesses, otherwise he will find
far more time than he would wish to wander the galleries.

Margaret Vaughan finds that the complexities and stigma surrounding
social security benefits is deterring the most needy from seeking help
SCROUNGERS and dole cheats have long featured in Tory demonology.
Social Security Secretary Peter Lilley recently declared war on the
benefit fraudsters, claiming they robbed the system of #1400m a year.
What he omitted to mention was the #2700m of benefits that went
unclaimed in a single year, according to the Department of Social
Security. That's almost double the amount the new crackdown aims to
recover within three years.
Is there some connection? Professor Adrian Sinfield of Edinburgh
University's Social Policy Unit thinks so.
Evidence shows that the reasons for vast amounts of benefits going
unclaimed is twofold. The benefits system is incredibly complex and
people often don't know what they are entitled to. ''And secondly
there's still a stigma, which some people find difficult to believe.
It's clear from research that many people, particularly the elderly and
disabled, don't apply for benefits because of this,'' Sinfield says.
Much more work could be done in fraud prevention, with a range of
devices to make it difficult to cheat, says Sinfield. Dr Dee Cook, the
author of Rich Law, Poor Law, which contrasted Government attitudes to
benefit fraud and white collar tax cheats, believes there is another
agenda behind the high-profile fraud crackdown.
''Its aim is to put people off claiming, by making them feel like
fraudsters and to undermine confidence in the benefits system, and
undermine confidence among people who are genuinely unemployed, and
genuinely poor.''
Dr Cook, of Wolverhampton University, found that social security
cheats were more than 30 times more likely to be prosecuted than tax
dodgers.
The Child Poverty Action Group believes genuine claimants are deterred
and confused by benefit application forms. These have become more
complex and, say the campaigners, more intrusive. The new incapacity
benefit form, for instance, is 35 pages long. DSS estimates suggest that
between 500,000 and 1.5 million people a year fail to take up benefit to
which they are entitled, which works out at around #13m a week going
unclaimed.
Pensioners miss out on #400m in income support and #1600m in housing
benefits. The Commons Select Committee on Social Security recently
commissioned a new resources survey which it hopes will explain why many
pensioners entitled to income support don't claim benefit.
In January, government statisticians disclosed that the take-up of
housing benefit by private tenants had fallen sharply. As much as #610m
in housing benefit went unclaimed in 1992 compared with #360m the
previous year. Almost one in five private tenants had failed to claim
their entitlement.
The #2700m overall that is not claimed by those who are entitled to
housing benefit, income support, and family credit amounted on average
to #19.25 a week.
Donald Dewar, Shadow Social Security spokesman, says the main
deterrent is complexity: ''People don't know what they're entitled to.
The system is not geared to tell them.'' What's needed is a system which
gives a high value to effectively reaching the people it's trying to
help and at the same time strikes at abuse.
Next year, the fraud crackdown will mean 300,000 extra home visits by
Benefits Agency staff. These, says Deward, should have a two-pronged aim
of tackling abuse and reducing the unclaimed total.
Central Region, in common with some other large Scottish authorities,
employs welfare benefits staff to help those living in poverty untangle
the web of the benefits system. In one six-month period -- January to
July last year -- the welfare workers dealt with 1130 inquiries from
people looking for help. Altogether, it was found, they were entitled to
an estimated #1.2m in benefits ranging through invalid care allowance,
war pensions, and attendance allowance to crisis loans. From the
backdated element due, which amounted to #113,986.61, it's clear that a
lot of people were losing out.
As is shown by the take-up campaign in Easterhouse, more money is lost
to people who need it than is lost through fraud. That, though, is not
the heady stuff of headline-making speeches or conference ovations.

TOKYO: Three US soldiers were charged and remanded in custody
yesterday, three weeks after they were alleged to have gang-raped a
12-year-old Japanese schoolgirl on the southern island of Okinawa. The
alleged rape fuelled fierce anti-American protests and calls by local
leaders and citizens for the closure of US military bases on Okinawa,
home to about 24,000 of the 44,000 US troops stationed in Japan.

MARRIAGE wrecker, femme fatale, a blonde Venus flytrap who consumes
men like insects -- Princess Diana can do nothing right these days. Once
the darling of the tabloid press, fashion role model, devoted mother,
saintly visitor to the Aids ward, innocent victim of an arrogant husband
besotted with his ageing, plain (the worst sin of all, given a bride the
world found desirable), married mistress, she has now been recast.
The fairy princess, the virgin bride plucked from the obscurity of the
Belgravia kindergarten has been transformed into a sexual predator, a
woman thrashing around trying to devise a role for herself, forever
upstaging her estranged husband and damaging the royal family's image by
her wanton, selfish behaviour. She has become a twentieth-century
Catherine the Great laying sexual waste wherever she goes.
It is an astonishing transformation, but is it the true picture? Or is
she a woman maligned? She may well be the victim of dirty tricks by an
Establishment out to restore the battered reputation of the Man who Must
be King.
The present brouhaha surrounding the princess's actions and the way
she is being depicted should, therefore, be seen in the context of the
remarkably successful whitewash job that has been done on the Prince of
Wales since those dark days when he turned to Jonathan Dimbleby as a
surrogate father confesssor and spilled the beans. That there is a
dirty-tricks campaign against the princess has been frequently alleged
and is, like all such alleged campaigns, almost impossible to prove or
disprove.
But friends in high places on either side have talked. It is
interesting to speculate who it was that told the media about footballer
Will Carling's visit to Kensington Palace with those presents for the
princes? Nobody drops in on the royals, least of all their lovers. Even
Diana's father made an appointment. Did she talk? Or did somebody
wishing to blacken her character talk?
Not that the Princess's behaviour has been entirely blameless. She has
shown herself to be an adept manipulator of the media, skilled at using
a frock to speak volumes like the little black strapless number she wore
to that art show at the Serpentine Gallery.
During her 14 years of marriage she has learned how to present herself
to the world. The shy, 20-year-old, pudding-faced, ring-twisting Sloane
of those famous engagement pictures has disappeared entirely. In her
place is a svelte 34-year-old could-be Hollywood wife well able to
orchestrate things like Andrew Morton's book giving her side of the
marriage.
The Carling affair is but the icing on an already fruit-rich media
cake. That the princess is said to have found him attractive is
understandable. He is undeniably a handsome man and the fact that he is
married would be neither here nor there for a lady with her background.
The princess comes from a long line of bolters straight out of the
pages of a Nancy Mitford novel. Long before the suburbs started swapping
car keys and wives, the British aristocracy, to which she belongs, were
sneaking down the corridors of their stately homes after lights out at
the weekend into the bedrooms of other well-bred people's partners.
Carling is also a sportsman. He keeps fit. So does she. The princess
is obsessed with her appearance. She spends hours perspiring in the
sauna, strains endlessly on weight-training machines, and sweats and
toils in the gymnasium to achieve a body refined to perfection. By all
accounts he is her kind of man in many other respects -- not one of the
world's talkers, and not exactly an intellectual, being blessed with
roughly the brains a Rugby player requires, and every bit into keeping
fit as she is.
Judging by his behaviour -- the ''old farts'' remark alone suggests
naivety bordering on the clueless -- he is somebody who has never
learned how to cope with exposure to the tabloids. His wife Julia, a
professional media manipulator, is another matter and if there is black
propaganda about she would know how to spread it.
The Carlings' decision for a trial separation after 15months of, for
the most part, unusually well-publicised marital bliss, may end the
current media interest in his relationship with the princess, such as it
is.
The media circus would not be there had it not been for his links with
the princess. Should he and Julia get back together the world will
possibly forget them, as it has forgotten James Hewitt, James Gilbey,
and Oliver Hoare, past men in the princess's life. If not, the beady
eyes of the paparazzi will still be fixed on the Carlings.
While their home in Putney was besieged with newsmen and television
crews yesterday, in spite of the fact that neither was there, it was
training as usual at the Chelsea Harbour Club gym for the Princess of
Wales. But it has been business as usual all week for her, including a
rare display of royal wit when she recited that limerick at Auberon
Waugh's literary lunch telling the tabloids where to put it:
'The Princess was heard to declare,
Let gossips poke fun if they dare.
My real inspiration Is Bron's invitation.
Put that in your tabloids, so there!'
The question is whether she really is a wrecker of homes. Her past
friendships have not ended up with couples in the divorce court as
happened with Camilla Parker Bowles -- not that the prince had anything
to do with that divorce, of course. Her male friends have almost all
been single men about society and given that her marriage is in ruins
she is as entitled to friendships as is her husband.
As for Mr Carling, it is flattering to be offered the hand of
friendship by a princess with film-star allure, especially when you have
interests in common. If one of you is a sporting hero and the other has
two small boys there is no reason why the sporting hero should not
oblige the friend's small boys with his favours. But that is not to say
it must end willy-nilly in sexual intercourse. If it is not an
adulterous liaison, and there is nothing to suggest it is, then it may
be unwise, but that is as far as it goes, and in this day and age we
have surely learned that a woman can have men as friends without having
them as lovers also.
Maybe, as was suggested in a rare leader in The Daily Telegraph, which
on occasions is the voice of the Establishment, it is time for the
Prince and Princess of Wales to divorce. Nothing will remove the
spotlight from the princess, but as an ex-Princess of Wales she would
attract less attention and as a divorced single parent her friendships
would arouse less interest than do those of an estranged wife.
The princess appears to be a female Jekyll and Hyde. There is the
caring public figure on the one hand who visits the sick, is accessible
to people and always looks like a princess, although one with a
high-fashion dress sense. On the other there is the private person
notorious as a monstrously selfish, demanding employer, as a woman who
hones in on susceptible men seeking adulation, and someone who knows how
to be found doing things if she wants that to happen.
The eyes of the paparazzi are not everywhere. Sometimes they have to
be told where to look. She may not always do the telling.
Manipulator or victim? The answer is surely that she is both. She has
manipulated situations to suit herself, but she has been victim of
manipulation in turn. She is the victim of an unsuccessful marriage,
although the prince has his case, and everything she does, no matter how
innocent, which involves a man gets interpreted to her detriment.
But she is not a nun, just as her estranged husband is not a monk. As
long as she is married to Prince Charles she will end up in the
headlines. She clearly enjoys her royal status so let her become a
latter-day Anne of Cleves, live her own life and she will have the
status and income to carry on doing her good works. If that solution was
good enough for Henry VIII it should be good enough for Prince Charles.
The prince must find the alimony, the state must support the mother of a
future king, who should be allowed to lead her private life as she
wishes while performing public duties, which she does perfectly.
As for the Carlings, they should get on with their lives in as much
privacy as any sporting hero with a media wife is accorded.

THE 150 inhabitants of the remote island of Berneray yesterday
celebrated the completion of their community's first housing association
project.
Mr Fred Macleod, chairman of the community-based housing association,
said the development of affordable rented housing had been necessary to
help retain the small but enthusiastic community on the island, which
lies off North Uist.
Eight houses for rent and a health board treatment and waiting room
have been built at a cost of about #500,00O -- money which came from
Scottish Homes and the private sector.
Scottish Homes chief executive Peter McKinlay, who was on Berneray to
mark the occasion, said that in many ways it was a major event in
Scottish housing when an island community of 150 people had been
motivated to get together to form a housing association and deliver
houses within two years of being registered.
The completed houses were of good quality, good value and designed to
deal with the high exposure and particular weather conditions of
Berneray.
Councillor Alasdair Nicholson, chairman of housing for the Western
Isles Islands Council, said the project showed what could be achieved
when small groups took the initiative and worked towards improving their
local community.

THE American inventor of what is seen as a significant development in
prosthetics will be attending a seminar which will discuss his work in
Edinburgh today.
The Flex Foot, which is made from carbon fibre, is being used by
prosthetists at the city's Princess Margaret Rose Orthopaedic Hospital.
It is said to behave in a natural way for the patient without the
necessity of complicated joints and moving parts. When weight is
transferred through the heel to the toe, the carbon fibre laminate
flexes and returns to shape.
Mr David Gow, director of the prosthetic services centre, said Flex
Foot had proved popular with disabled athletes and was being extended to
ordinary patients.
Ms Julie Callan, senior prosthetist, said the hospital has provided 20
feet for 18 patients in Scotland in the past year. The cost was #24,000,
varying in price from #300 to #1500.
Ms Callan said the greatest benefit found by patients fitted with it
was that it saved their energy. The foot was doing a lot more work for
the wearer.
One patient, Mr David Whyte, 29, from East Calder, who has had both
feet amputated, said the new feet had made him much more confident and
able to walk much farther than with his previous artificial limbs.
Another Flex Foot wearer, Mr James Center, 35, from Edinburgh, who had
his right leg amputated after a road accident when he was two, now takes
part in shot putting and canoeing.
The Flex Foot was invented by Mr Van Phillips, who will attend today's
seminar at the hospital, where users of his invention will discuss its
merits.

Odessa, Texas
US Government investigators have opened an investigation into the
fiery crash of a vintage bomber that killed two British and three
American flyers.
The twin-engine Second World War vintage B-26 Marauder, the only
airworthy Marauder in the world before the accident, crashed and burned
in West Texas yesterday while rehearsing for this weekend's annual
Confederate Air Force air show.
British flyers Colin Dunwell of Surrey and Chris Gardner of Essex,
were killed along with three Americans.
Two pilots,Walter Wootton of Harlingen, Texas, and Vernon Thorp of
Ocala, Florida, were described as most experienced pilots of the
non-profit Confederate Air Force, which refurbishes and flies military
aircraft in air shows around the world.--Reuter.

Washington
A SENIOR senator and a brilliant young Congressman who seemed to have
a golden future will both vanish into the dark tomorrow. Both were
brought down by their sexual appetites and by modern technology.
Senator Bob Packwood of Oregon, a Republican, was convicted by his
colleagues of sexual harassment of female members of his staff, and
trying to conceal the fact by tampering with his diaries. Mel Reynolds,
a Democrat from Chicago, was sentenced to five years in jail yesterday
for sleeping with a minor and then obstructing justice in an attempt to
conceal his guilt.
They resigned today. Senator Packwood was chairman of the finance
committee, the second most important party member in the Senate. Mr
Reynolds was the leader of a new generation of black Congressmen. Both
scandals were nasty shocks to their parties.
Mr Packwood was destroyed chiefly by the testimony of 18 women who
agreed to make their complaints public -- and by detailed diaries he had
kept over the years, recorded on tape. Mr Reynolds's fate was sealed by
recorded telephone calls with a 15-year-old schoolgirl.
The judge who sentenced Mr Reynolds denounced him for betraying the
trust of his constituents. A Rhodes scholar, he made an academic and
political career for himself despite the poverty of his share-cropper
family, and became a role model for a generation of ambitious black
youths.
He threw it all away because of his predilection for kinkysex with a
minor, and because he then paid her and her family money to deny the
accusation.
Senator Packwood has alternately confessed and denied his sins.
He kept a diary for decades, on which he compulsively recorded every
detail of his life. Long passages were released by the Senate ethics
committee, and the newspapers have amused themselves by printing
excerpts.
The passages that convicted him were also released, together with his
attempts to amend them. He tried recording over the original passages,
or dictating bowdlerised versions to his secretary -- but failed to
cover his tracks adequately, just like Richard Nixon 21 years ago. The
ethics committee was as indignant at his attempted deception as at the
sexual transgressions.
There will be a special election in Oregon to find a replacement for
Mr Packwood, and the Democrats have high hopes of capturing the seat
since he barely scraped home in 1990.
* te Wilson, the governor of California, has given up the race for the
Republican presidential nomination. He could raise neither the money,
nor any interest outside the state.
The candidates left are Senators Bob Dole, Phil Gramm, Arlen Specter,
and Richard Lugar; Lamar Alexander, a former governor of Tennessee;
media star Pat Buchanan; and a few extreme outsiders, including Steve
Forbes who publishes a magazine and once ran a Highland Show in
Scotland.
There is always the shadow of General Colin Powell, who will have to
decide in the next month or so whether to run for the Republican
nomination.

John McAllion argues that despite claims to the contrary, the Tories
are intent on dismantling the National Health Service piece by piece,
reducing it to a 'safety net' service
IN the first sentence of his article ''Debunking health-cuts myth''
(The Herald, Wednesday, September 27), Lord James Douglas-Hamilton gives
the game away. He refers to the NHS as a ''safety net'' service, echoing
recent right-wing calls for it to become precisely that.
The NHS is not a safety net. It was meant to be, and should be still,
a service for all of the people.
It was always intended that the NHS would be comprehensive in its
coverage of our health needs, should be funded mainly from general
taxation, would offer treatment on the basis of medical need not ability
to pay and would be free at the point of use. It's that kind of health
service that Lord James and his like are now destroying through their
market reforms.
Lord James decries an unjustified ''mood of pessimism'' about the NHS
in the very week that the RCN publishes the largest survey of UK nurses
revealing that nearly 40% of nurses would quit the NHS because they are
fed up with low pay, poor career prospects and lack of job security.
Recently reshuffled into the Health portfolio and remote from the
day-to-day realities of the health service, he asks us to believe him
rather than the authentic voice of nurses who have spent lifetimes
making the real NHS work.
The Minister claims improvements in patient care. He says this is the
week that the medical director of one of Scotland's largest teaching
trusts (Ninewells in Dundee) reveals that lack of resources has led to
the deaths of up to 30 heart patients a year, has placed intolerable
pressure on intensive care beds and hampered the delivery of care to
seriously ill cancer and kidney patients.
He boasts of increased health spending on the very day that a Highland
trust announces job cuts and the closure of a ward due to a budget
deficit of nearly #2m. On the same day, it is revealed that the NHS
Management Executive are intervening in the affairs of an Aberdeen trust
because of their concern that another potential deficit of nearly #2m is
not being managed properly by the board. The director of finance
announces his intention to resign in protest.
It has long been a commonplace in Scottish politics to criticise Tory
Ministers for being out of touch with the realities of Scottish life.
Rarely, however can any one Tory in such a short time and by his sheer
lack of sense and hopeless sense of timing, have os vindicated that
criticism.
He boasts that the benefits of fundholding will attract more and more
GPs, with nearly half of the population being in fundholding practices
by April next year.
He either doesn't know or isn't telling us that this is so because
Government funding of practice allowances shamelessly discriminates in
favour of fundholders. How many of his 300 fundholders are willing
converts? How many of them reluctantly go along with it because it is
the only way in which they can secure proper funding for their practices
and their patients?
Does he really believe that the proposal to privatise the new cottage
hospital at Stonehaven is ''exciting'' and ''a promising innovation?''
Is he serious when he labels as ''dogma'' opposition pan.
Only Tories could fail to understand the revulsion across Scotland
over what they aim to do at Stonehaven. If a private consortium wins the
tender for the service, Stonehaven will be unique among ''NHS''
hospitals. It will be privately owned and privately built. The GPs,
nurses, professions allied to medicine and ancillary staff who work
there will be employed under contract to the private owners of the
hospital. It will be a private hospital in everything but name and
funding.
Were the Tories to win the next General Election, Stonhaven would
become the model for the future development of the NHS. Stonehaven
contains the seeds of the future destruction of the NHS. it's as simple
as that.
Those of us who oppose what the Government is doing to the health
service do so because we care about the NHS; we are not blinded by
dogma.
Lord James writes about the health service belonging to the people.
Yet, it is run by quangos over which the people have no control.
We have to restore the NHS to the people of Scotland. That is why we
need a Scottish Health Minister accountable to an elected Scottish
Parliament.
We need to replace market mechanisms and business practice inside the
NHS with a comprehensive, integrated health service where the shape and
balance of future health care provision is properly planned and
implemented under a genuinely democratic and accountable system of
management.
Lord James, in common with other Tories tries to justify creeping
privatisation in the NHS on the grounds that we can no longer afford to
pay publicly for the ''ever-expanding demands...of an increasingly
ageing population.'' It simply is not true. We still spend less of our
GDP on our health service than do most of our European partners. If, as
he says, ''there are still problems,'' then these spring not from
insatiable demands by the people but from under funding and waste by the
Government.
The NHS will only survive if the Government of the day believes in it.
The present Government, is, piece by piece, dismantling the finest
institution this country has ever created.

Memory lane revisited as Glasgow University honours its unique Early
Twenties Club.
ONCE they were 100 strong. But the fast-forward button of time had cut
their ranks to just five as they met for one last time yesterday to
rewind 350 years of memories of a unique club founded in the early
1920s.
They sat down to lunch under the bronze gaze of James Bridie in his
eponymous library at Glasgow University Union -- the main topic of
conversation the Early Twenties Club.
Bridie, in his autobiography, One Way Of Living, said Glasgow
University students were men of the world, humorous, companionable, and
moderate even in riot.
Here then were the very embodiment of these sentiments -- 94-year-old
James Barry, Tom Shepherd, 92, Hamish Gardner, 92, Robert Hutcheson, 91,
and the youngster of the famous five, John Neil, 87, a former lawyer,
who in a pause during the play admitted that he had sneaked into the
club a year after membership was closed.
They had been invited by the union's management and current president,
Mr Stuart Haire, a mere 21-year-old, to witness the unveiling of a
plaque which reads ''In recognition of the life-long service to the
union, the Early Twenties Club whose commitment and dedication are a
guiding light to us all.''
Flushed with youth and the occasional sherry, they had formed the club
in the early twenties and had met for dinner every year thereafter. As
the years caught up, they had changed to luncheon engagements 10 years
ago.
''We were too decrepit to be let out for dinner. We didn't eat a big
dinner, it was a waste of good food,'' said Mr Gardner, a former
headmaster at Glenwood, in Castlemilk.
The talk over the luncheon table ranged through their centuries of
memories. ''It was a very popular club. The moving spirits were people
who had returned from the First World War. Among our number were people
who went on to become judges, barristers, and a civil service head,''
said Dr Hutcheson, a former Glasgow University registrar.
The dinners ''were very gentlemanly affairs. There were no woman
members.'' And as you can expect they ''had a hoot or two before we sat
down to eat'', said Mr Gardner.
After a lunch of cream of mushroom soup, chicken supreme with a white
wine sauce, and charlotte russe, it was time for nineties man Stuart
Haire to toast his guests.
''Can't I tempt you to try tonight's freshers' beer drinking
competition? There's a case of beer if you can sink a pint in 1.6
seconds.''
The famous five looked at their port and shook their heads sadly. Some
things, it seems, had changed with the times, and not for the better, at
Glasgow University.
While Glasgow University is still strong on clubs -- there is the
Saturday Night Milk Fever Club, the all-woman PMS club, and the Vets of
1993 -- the names don't quite have the same resonance. Nor do they have
the famous five.

Madrid
SPAIN'S longest kidnap drama ended today when police found the body of
a 21-year-old student buried in an abandoned factory south of Madrid.
Miss Anabel Segura was snatched 900 days ago as she was jogging near
her home in Madrid's wealthiest suburb on Easter Sunday, 1993.
It was revealed that Miss Segura, daughter of an executive from a
multi-national company, had been murdered only hours later and had been
dead for two days before a ransom demand for #750,000 was made.
The kidnapping of the business studies student captured the nation's
heart. Television and radio programmes brought massive waves of sympathy
and 30,000 calls from people offering information.
More than 1600 calls were followed up by detectives in Spain's biggest
criminal manhunt.
Today, as two men and a woman allegedly confessed to the kidnapping,
it was revealed that a heart-rending recorded message to the distressed
parents had not been made by their daughter, but by the gang's female
accomplice.
It said: ''I want to be home with you . . . I really want to see you
all. This is what you have to do to end this quickly. See you later,
Daddy. Goodbye Mummy. Sister, I love you very much. Goodbye.''
The parents had the ransom money ready within two days. Despite 15
calls from the kidnappers, however, it was never collected.
One of the calls from the public gave detectives the vital lead. Also
expert analysis of one ransom call revealed that children's voices in
the background had accents from Toledo. Police arrested the gang at a
village in the province.
The two men took detectives to the abandoned ceramics factory where a
mechanical digger found the body of the young woman the kidnappers had
promised would be returned safely as soon as the ransom had been paid.
The tragedy dominated the media in Spain today.
The family lawyer, who attended a packed press conference, said:
''Anabel's parents are not dominated by hate but they want the full
weight of the law and justice against the kidnappers and killers of
Anabel.''

Lyons
A PRIME suspect in a wave of bombings in France this year was shot
dead by police today in a gun battle near the central city of Lyons.
Algerian-born Khaled Kelkal, 24, whose fingerprints were found on a
bomb placed on a high-speed railway line last month, opened fire on
paratroops as they tried to arrest him and he was killed when they shot
back, police said.
Police, using helicopters and tracker dogs, had launched a huge search
for Kelkal in a woods around Vaugneray outside Lyons after a shoot-out
on Wednesday in which one of his colleagues was wounded and two others
were captured.
Fearing that he had slipped through their net, police were preparing
to wind down their hunt when a source called to say he saw Kelkal
getting off a bus at a road outside Vaugneray.
Kelkal shot at a squadron of paratroops which was rushed to the scene,
police said.
''The usual warnings were made,'' a police official said. ''He was
asked to give himself up. He continued to fire. He was killed.''
Kelkal became France's most wanted man last month -- 17,000 pictures
of him were plastered across the country -- after he was linked to a
bomb which failed to explode beside a high-speed railway line north of
Lyons.
Kelkal's fingerprints were found on the adhesive tape attaching a
detonator to the bomb.
The explosive device bore all the hallmarks of five other bombs which
have exploded in the Lyons region and Paris since July, killing seven
people and injuring more than 130.
Police, suspecting Algerian Muslim extremists to be responsible, have
raided suspected fundamentalists' homes, questioned dozens of suspects,
and made spot identity checks on some 800,000 people as part of a
massive security drive.
Muslim militants say France backs Algeria's military-led government
which they are fighting to overthrow. An estimated 40,000 people have
died in violence since Algerian authorities scrapped 1992 elections the
fundamentalists were poised to win.
Kelkal, a petty delinquent from a depressed and high-immigrant suburb
of Lyons, escaped after a gun battle at a police roadblock in July and
he eluded a police swoop near his home earlier this month.
After Wednesday's shoot-out, 760 armed police and a squad of
paratroops sealed off a 150 sq mile area around Vaugneray, where Kelkal
was last seen camping.
Police said they found two shotguns, a submachine-gun, and an
alarm-clock fitted with electrical wires that could have been used as a
timer device for a bomb at the scene. There was also a copy of the Koran
and Muslim extremist literature.
However Kelkal's alleged relationship with Algerian extremists remains
vague. His family claimed they had not seen him since the end of June.

NICOTINE may reduce the risk of heart disease when taken through a
skin patch, according to research published in the Journal of the Royal
College of Physicians yesterday.
A team led by Professor John Rhodes, at the University Hospital of
Wales, Cardiff, found that levels of one of the main agents of
cardiovascular disease were lowered in the blood of patients who used a
nicotine patch.
They had less fibrinogen -- the protein from which blood clots are
made -- than another group of patients who were not given nicotine.
Smoking not only increases fibrinogen levels but also boosts two other
risk factors -- the concentration of blood fats and the aggregation
clot-triggering platelets.
The patch nicotine was found not to alter blood fat levels and
platelet activity.
However, while nicotine is addictive and raises the heart rate, the
extent to which it helps make the blood sticky and more prone to
clotting is not clear.

AGRICULTURE Minister Douglas Hogg yesterday bowed to pressurefrom
Aberdeen's academic community by announcing that half of the scientific
posts at the Food Science Laboratory at Torry are to be moved to other
institutions within the city.
Thirty-five of the internationally renowned lab's 70 scientists will
be transferred to the Marine Science Laboratory, also at Torry, the
Rowett Research Institute, and the University of Aberdeen.
The news was broken to staff yesterday at a meeting with Professor
Peter Stanley, chief executive of the Central Science Laboratory, the
MAFF executive agency responsible for running Torry.
Much of the lab's work involves research into food safety.
Union leaders said they were disappointed that Scottish Secretary
Michael Forsyth, who intervened in the dispute earlier this year, had
not succeeded in persuading his Cabinet colleague to retain all 100 jobs
in Aberdeen.
The fate of the 30 support staff at the lab remained unclear last
night amid rumblings that only a handful of them would be transferred.
Mr Hogg said the scientific posts would be distributed between
Aberdeen and York, with microbiology posts predominating at York.
The closure moves provoked anger among Aberdeen MPs and scientists,
who formed a task force headed by Professor Hugh Pennington, of the
University of Aberdeen.

EDUCATION chiefs in the Borders are to bring forward a review of
school drug incident procedures following the death of a 12-year-old boy
earlier this week.
Mr Graeme Donald, assistant director of education, said a group
involving officials, police, and advisers had already been set up to
review policy.
''This programme, which will review procedures as part of the schools'
health education programme, has now been accelerated,'' said Mr Donald.
The review has been brought forward following the death of Peebles
High pupil Alistair Lambert, found dead at his home after being
suspended from school over allegations relating to the possession of
drugs.
The acceleration of the review comes only days before the launch of a
new Scottish Office drive warning children of the dangers of drugs.
However, Scotland's biggest education authority, Strathclyde, said it
did not plan to review its drugs policy.
Recent figures show 15 schoolchildren were suspended in Strathclyde
schools as a result of drugs incidents in 1994. Nine months into 1995,
that figure has already grown to 28.
* One hundred and seventy third- and fourth-year pupils from Lothian
will explore drug misuse at a conference in Edinburgh on Tuesday
organised by the Church of Scotland's drugs counselling service.

FOR a mere #100 per month, France's brilliant and supercilious Prime
Minister Alain Juppe, whose subtle analyses of international politics
during his stint as Foreign Minister were so admired by the British
Foreign Office, has embroiled himself in what is virtually an affair of
state.
It is a delightful farce in the now well-established Fifth Republic
tradition of corruption and abusive privilege. It is filling the press,
sharpening the pens of the cartoonists, and has the bully boy of local
politics, National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen, crowing with delight.
It is not so much the fault itself, as the tastelessness of that fault
and the desperate efforts by Mr Juppe's government to cover it up, that
are riling public opinion.
At the origin of the affair is an apartment owned by the City of Paris
Council and rented by Mr Juppe's son Laurent. Just before the summer
break, the press reported that two years ago Mr Juppe, who in his old
job was responsible for the finances of city hall and Deputy Mayor of
Paris, had ordered that his son's rent be lowered by #100 a month.
Foolishly, he even signed a document to that effect.
Last July, when a Paris ratepayers' association asked the procurator's
office to press charges, Mr Juppe, instead of owning up and admitting he
had been soft over his presumably hard-up son, pushed his colleague
Jacques Toubon, the Minister of Justice, into defending his case. Before
the procurator had made a pronouncement, Mr Toubon said on television
that there was ''nothing irregular'' about the #100 reduction.
Mr Juppe himself was second into the breach, publicly stating the same
conclusion. The affair was then officially shelved, the procurator
ruling with considerable subtlety that the charge of corruption could
not stand because Mr Juppe had not been the beneficiary of his own
largesse.
Then the SCPC, the official body responsible for sniffing out cases of
administrative corruption, was called on to pursue its own
investigations by a group of socialist MPs. Mr Toubon promptly
instructed his Chief of Cabinet, Alexandre Benmakhlouf, to sort them
out. The director of the SCPC, Bernard Challe, was pressured by
telephone and even by a letter on Ministry of Justice-headed notepaper
to throw the case out.
Peeved, Mr Challe refused to answer his phone or his mail and was
summoned to the ministry by Mr Benmakhlouf a fortnight ago to be warned
that the affair, unless rapidly stifled, could have ''unpleasant
consequences'' for him.
Mr Challe threatened to resign, but changed his mind after talking to
his staff and was then summoned to the ministry by Mr Toubon in person.
Dissatisfied by Mr Challe's resistance to his well-meaning pressure, Mr
Toubon told Mr Benmakhlouf to inform Mr Challe that his resignation,
although withdrawn, had been accepted. Mr Challe, however, refused to
go.
Last Monday the SCPC pronounced that Mr Juppe could be charged with
abusive privilege, only hours after Mr Toubon had made a desperate
last-ditch attempt on television to protect the Prime Minister. The
findings of Mr Challe's organisation would turn out, Mr Toubon
predicted, to be ''void'', and the whole affair was in any case a plot
mounted by the socialist opposition.
The rent farce could hardly have cropped up at a worse moment, as Mr
Juppe and President Jacques Chirac alike are taking a steady and
record-breaking plunge in the popularity polls.
Worse is to come. The fuss about the flat of Juppe junior has obscured
the fact that Juppe senior also lives in a city hall apartment and that
it is illegal for a deputy mayor, as he was, to sign a lease with his
own city hall. Not to mention totally tasteless to have #150,000-worth
of improvements carried out on his home, as Mr Juppe did, at the expense
of the ratepayer.
The latter years of the former socialist government saw an
unprecedented wave of corruption scandals. Then the conservative
government of Edouard Balladur, elected in 1993, continued to throw up
affair after affair.
Now the leading member of President Chirac's team is combining abuse
of privilege with an evident inability to produce rapid improvement in
the economy.
The problem is that the man flourishing on this affair like a mushroom
on manure is the National Front leader, Mr Le Pen. At his party's annual
rally in Paris last weekend, he was almost unable to contain his
delight.
''The switch over from a socialist to a Gaullist regime had only been
an apparent change, not a real one,'' he told his supporters.

<HEADLINE>DNA tests land falcon breeder in jail</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A BREEDER who bought rare peregrine falcon eggs from a Scottish
gamekeeper and sold the hatched birds was jailed for four months at
Snaresbrook Crown Court, yesterday.
Peter Gurr, 54, of Chafford Walk, Rainham, Essex, received concurrent
four- month terms on six counts of selling a wild bird, to which he had
pled guilty.
Gurr, a panel beater, was charged under the Control of Trade in
Endangered Species (Enforcement) Regulations 1985, after a #9000 police
operation codenamed Dutch Lady, which involved raids on falcon owners
and DNA testing to determine the birds' parentage.
Sentencing Gurr, Judge David Pitman said he had abused his position as
a registered keeper of peregrine falcons.
''I take the view that only an immediate custodial sentence is
appropriate,'' said the judge.
Mr Duncan Munro-Kerr, prosecuting, told the court the charges arose
from a police operation on February 27 last year, when blood samples
were taken from about 49 peregrine falcons -- 30 were offspring, the
rest parents.
The samples were submitted for DNA comparison and, of the 18 offspring
which had been registered by Gurr in 1993, 16 were not related to any of
the registered parents.
Gurr was interviewed and said that although he thought there was an
error in the testing procedure, he had bought nine eggs in the 1993
breeding season from a source in Scotland, and then registered them as
the offspring of his captive parent birds.
''He admitted that this wasn't the first year he had done it,'' said
Mr Munro-Kerr.
Gurr told police he had been approached on a hunting holiday in
Scotland by a gamekeeper, who said the eggs would be destroyed
otherwise.
Gurr met him at Scotch Corner, on the A1 near Darlington, each time
buying four eggs at #150 each. He incubated and hatched the eggs and
later sold the birds for between #390 and #550, the court was told.
Mr Munro-Kerr said attention was first drawn to Gurr because of the
''abnormally high'' success rate in breeding he was claiming. If his
figures were true, he had a breeding success of 75%, whereas the average
was 25%.
Mr George Heimler, defending, drew attention to Gurr's previous good
character and guilty pleas, and said the birds were not ill-treated.
He stressed: ''Whatever his wrongdoing, he is a lover of wildlife and
birds.'' He said the welfare of the birds had been part of Gurr's
motivation, as well as the financial element.
After hearing the sentence, investigations officer Guy Shorrock said
the society was delighted at the lengths the Metropolitan Police's
investigation reached over what was a serious conservation issue.

NEXT week's Labour Party conference looks set to embarrass Labour
leader Tony Blair by backing both a formula and a figure for the
proposed statutory national minimum wage.
Mr Blair has declared he has no intention of getting involved in
figures or formulae until Labour is in power and then through a Low Pay
Commission which would a consider the views of employers and unions.
Compositing of conference motions will continue today but it looked
yesterday as though the many motions on the national minimum wage would
be boiled down to just two composites.
One would promote the low pay commission while the other would include
both the ''half male median earnings'' formula, which is already Labour
Party policy, and the #4.15 an hour that many calculate it would have
triggered until new statistics this week pushed that figure to #4.26.
Many unions, including Unison (with about 12% of the conference vote)
and the Transport and General Workers Union (14%) are already committed
to support #4.15. Weekend delegation meetings will decide the final
voting pattern and the position of the General, Municipal, and
Boilermakers (12%) could be crucial.
Both composites could well be carried, in which case Mr Blair would
simply opt for his commission. Only in the unlikely event of the figure
and formula gaining the two-thirds majority necessary for it to be made
party policy would he be seriously embarrassed.
The conference will be the last in which the unions have a majority
voice as their 70% combined vote is due to be reduced to 50% from this
year and may be cut back further as individual party membership
increases. There are several motions demanding that the union vote
should not be reduced below 50%.
Boosting the constituency vote to 50% may not necessarily make life
easier for Mr Blair -- all the motions demanding #4.15 came from
constituencies.
Meanwhile, Scots have shown their overwhelming support for the
introduction of a minimum wage in an opinion poll.
With more than three-quarters of Scots in agreement that low pay has
become more of a problem since the Conservatives came to power in 1979,
80% gave their support to the introduction of a minimum wage of #4.15
per hour or higher. Even among Tory voters, more than two-thirds were
found to be in support.
The results of the poll, commissioned by Unison, have been released to
coincide with a joint Unison/Scottish Low Pay Unit seminar on low pay in
Scotland.
Mr Matt Smith, Unison Scottish secretary, said yesterday: ''I hope
shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown gets the clear message from our poll that
the Scottish people back Labour's plan for a minimum wage but at a level
which will seriously begin to tackle the problem of poverty pay.''

Nairobi
CONFUSION reigned in the Comoros today after residents said seven
people, including two mercenaries, were killed in fresh fighting when
loyalist forces retook the international airport from mercenaries.
The residents, contacted by telephone, said that sporadic fighting was
taking place on the road to the airport, 10 miles outside the capital
Moroni.
French sources in the neighbouring island of Mayotte confirmed that
loyalists of ousted president Said Mohamed Djohar had control of the
airport.
However an air traffic control official in Mayotte said that
supporters of the French mercenary leader, Bob Denard, had control of
the Indian Ocean island state.
''We were tired of Djohar. The whole island is dancing in the
streets,'' he said.
He added that the airport had been re-opened and was awaiting the
arrival of a French transport plane to evacuate the wounded.
Denard's mercenaries said they had acted to topple a corrupt regime
and planned free elections to restore democracy.
In France, the former colonial power, officials condemned yesterday's
coup, but said they would not send in troops to put down the takeover,
despite having intervened in the past.
''We hope that the respect for democratic rules is imposed as quickly
as possible,'' Prime Minister Alain Juppe told reporters in Paris,
adding: ''Intervention is out of the question.''
In Mayotte, a French Foreign Legion spokesman said two companies were
on alert.
At UN headquarters in New York, Secretary-General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali called for the ''earliest possible release of the hostages
and the return of the Comoros to democratic ways''.
The coup was condemned by the US and the European Union.
The leader of the new military committee which ousted Djohar, Captain
Yaacoub Combo, said the ageing politician was safe at an undisclosed
location outside Moroni.
''He is safe, he is quiet where he is,'' Combo told Radio France
Internationale.
Sultan Chouzour, a former ambassador to France, said from Comoros: ''I
might say 80% of the public on the main island is in favour of the
change but what they don't want is to be ruled by Bob Denard.''
However Combo said the coup bid was being led by Comorians and denied
that Denard, a veteran mercenary, had played a leading role.
''All that's going on here, we are doing it. We are handling it,'' he
said. ''Bob Denard is here, he is not doing anything.''
Denard, 66, married in the Comoros when he headed the guard of
President Ahmed Abdallah, who was killed in 1989. Comorian authorities
blamed him for the killing and he fled under threat of French military
intervention.--Reuter/AP.

Workers like a dressing down on a Friday, as KENNEDY WILSON discovers
IN some jobs you can wear what you like and it really doesn't matter.
Homoeopathists consider there to be laissez faire on dress but jeans are
beyond the pale. ''Fairly smart and no jeans,'' says Maureen Chapple of
the clinic wing of the College of Homoeopathy in London referring to
what they recommended as being suitable dress.
There is a growing trend for firms to relax their dress codes from
Friday at 9am. ''Friday dressing'' first caught on in the US where the
culture of TGIF (Thank God It's Friday) is very strong. There is even a
restaurant chain called TGI Friday's.
''In the States people are in a party mood by Friday lunchtime and you
can't get much out of them on Friday afternoon,'' says Mary Spillane of
top image consultancy CMB. ''Now people are so casually dressed at the
theatre or out for dinner that it's quite shocking to Europeans. I'm an
American who has lived in the UK for 13 years and I go back and forth
all the time and I am still quite horrified at how the standards have
dropped. This sloppiness has carried over to the workplace.''
Dressing-down day has arrived in Britain at National Power and
publishers HarperCollins whose chairman has gone on record saying:
''People really like Friday dressing. It makes for a good and different
atmosphere.'' Others are sceptical. One Edinburgh recruitment consultant
was dismayed at the idea: ''We have a public office and we often have to
go out to meetings so I would say that it's not a good idea. I don't see
the reasoning behind it unless it's to get a quick start at the
weekend.''
Friday dressing hopes to capitalise on the TGIF feeling without a loss
in productivity and thus dispel the ''made on Friday'' nature of faulty
products and poor service. In the US, jeans manufacturer Levi Strauss,
which clearly has a vested interest in the issue, has done considerable
research. It has shown that productivity can go up when employees dress
down.
The power dress codes of the eighties have made many office workers
remain smart in the nineties when jobs are less secure and maybe, just
maybe, the best dressed in the office may be the last to get fired. Many
employees prefer a conventional uniform when they are not quite aware of
what's acceptable and what's not.
The trend for informality started in the Silicon Valley computer firms
of sunny California. ''Frontier industry'' jobs means a new, egalitarian
way of dressing for work suggesting that everyone was equally creative
with a worthwhile contribution to make.
Bill ''Microsoft'' Gates, America's second-richest man, is renowned
for his casual appearance. In ad agencies and record companies ''suits''
has long been the pejorative name for the non-creative people.
Many US firms have relaxed dress codes in the summer. Some tried
''Friday dressing'' and then extended it year round. Large corporations
like IBM have been seduced. And companies who stick to suit-and-tie
codes are slowly being considered stuffy and old fashioned.
It has also been suggested that colleagues can tell a lot more about
you in your casual clothes than when you dress in a smart suit. Power
dressing not only conveys authority but can hide weakness.

Los Angeles
THE jury in the O J Simpson double murder trial was handed the case
today to deliberate the fate of the football hero in the murders of his
ex-wife and her friend.
Judge Lance Ito handed the case over to the jury one year and three
days after the trial began, following the end of prosecutor Marcia
Clark's closing arguments.
After playing a composite tape of Nicole Brown Simpson's tearful
emergency calls to police in 1989 and 1992 to the rapt Los Angeles
courtroom, Clark told the jury, ''Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the
state of California . . . we ask you to find the defendant guilty in the
first degree of the murders of Ronald Goldman and Nicole Brown.''
In Washington, President Bill Clinton voiced concern over what the
White House called ''an ugly turn'' in the case, an apparent reference
to the rising emphasis on race.
Preceding Clark to the lectern, junior prosecutor Christopher Darden
told the jury in measured tones: ''It is clear, you know it is clear,
you feel it, you know it in your heart, you know it as you have sat here
day after day listening to this testimony.
''You know it, everybody knows he killed. The evidence is there. You
just have to find your way through the smoke. We have proved him guilty
to a scientific certainty. We have proved him guilty beyond a reasonable
doubt.''
Darden asked the jury of nine blacks, two whites, and one Hispanic to
ignore all the ''fiery rhetoric'' they heard from lead defence lawyer
Johnnie Cochran in his impassioned closing argument yesterday and to
concentrate on the evidence.
In particular, Darden implored the jurors to not to let the racism
displayed by Detective Mark Fuhrman sway them in their verdict.
Fuhrman, who testified to finding a bloodstained glove on Simpson's
estate the day after the murders, told the jury he was not a racist and
had not used racial slurs in the last 10 years. The defence, however,
played a tape in which Fuhrman said ''nigger'', and other witnesses said
he often used the word and had a deep hatred of African Americans.
Darden, telling the jury he had spent the last seven years
''prosecuting bad cops'', said: ''They want you to say Fuhrman is a
racist and he planted the glove.''
However, Darden told the jury: ''You can't get from point A to point B
if you just sit down and use your common sense.'' It was true, he said,
that Fuhrman was a racist. And it is also true (Simpson) killed these
two people. We proved that he killed these two people.''
Simpson, a sports broadcaster and TV pitchman since his playing days,
has pleaded not guilty to the murders on June 12, 1994, of Nicole Brown
Simpson and Ronald Goldman, who were stabbed to death outside Nicole
Simpson's luxury townhouse.
The marathon trial, which has fascinated television audiences
throughout America and much of the world, officially got under way with
the beginning of jury selection on September 26, 1994.
As hundreds of gawkers thronged outside the criminal courts building
in downtown Los Angeles today, police closed the street in front of the
building to traffic and cordoned the crowd off on the other side as a
safety measure.
The Los Angeles Police Department announced it would go on a
heightened state of readiness during jury deliberations to cope with any
disturbances that might follow the verdict.
Police brass were determined not be caught off guard as they were in
1992 when citywide riots broke out following not guilty verdicts against
four white officers accused of beating black motorist Rodney
King.--Reuter.

Who owns our forests? And what are they doing with them? Elizabeth
Buie, Environment Correspondent, investigates and come us up with
alarming answers
THEY were probably forestry's darkest days when wealthy showbusiness
personalities such as Terry Wogan, Cliff Richard, and snooker players
such as Steve Davis and Alex Higgins blanketed parts of Scotland with
fast-growing conifers to reduce their hefty tax bills.
These vast plantations covering land such as the Flow Country which
was never meant to support woodlands, put the final nail in the coffin
of what was once a rich ecological heritage.
Modern forestry practice had succeeded in wiping out more native
woodlands than all the overgrazing in the past two centuries.
It was these practices which prompted people in Scotland to ask the
questions: Who owns our forests? And what are they doing with them?
In 1988, the Government removed forestry from the tax system and in
recent years it has introduced a series of new woodland grants, some
promoting certain kinds of planting, some giving incentives to landlords
to provide access and recreation.
These changes have, however, done little to change the pattern of
ownership. When large tracts of forest come on the open market, it is
still only wealthy individuals, corporations and institutions who buy
because much of the land becomes available only in tracts worth millions
of pounds.
Bare land has certainly become less attractive to potential investors,
but existing plantations continue to attract good prices. Increasingly,
institutions and companies from Scandinavia, particularly Denmark, are
buying up Scottish woodlands because they are cheaper and more readily
available than in Denmark.
Those who openly criticise foreign ownership are told that the same
regulations apply to them as anyone else, so what difference can it make
who the ultimate owner is.
The new Forestry Minister at the Scottish Office, the Earl of Lindsay,
told The Herald that ''this great thing about foreign ownership'' was
just ''adolescent politics which I thought had gone down with the Berlin
Wall''.
He added: ''It is not who holds a piece of paper or deed of ownership,
but how it is managed and how it is enjoyed and what it delivers that is
important.''
And the convener of the Scottish Landowners' Federation, Graeme
Gordon, said he felt that it demonstrated how people had a particularly
emotional response to land.
''They are quite happy to see Motorola coming to Livingston, but not
Legoland to a Highland estate,'' he said.
Yet as long as we regulate our land use according to voluntary
agreement, we cannot be certain that owners will take advantage of the
menu of grants and incentives on offer -- the mess that the forests of
Mar Lodge Estate were allowed to become before being bought for the
nation by the National Trust for Scotland with a huge national lottery
grant is ample testimony to that.
So it does matter who owns our forests, why they want to own them, and
what they want to do with them.
One Highland Regional Councillor who has been involved in seven
separate attempts by communities to buy neighbouring woodlands is Dr
Michael Foxley. He believes that Forest Enterprise, which manages
Forestry Commission woodland, would rather sell to anyone other than the
local community or crofters.
He also believes that the days of forestry being used for taxation
advantage still exist.
He believes that some forestry management companies in this country
are advising potential foreign and British investors that it will be to
their financial advantage if they buy up woodlands as long as they do
certain things:
* that having bought the woodlands, they then fell, extract and haul
the timber at an artificially low price, which they can then offset
against their tax burden;
* they then sell the timber -- remembering that timber is sold tax
free -- at as high a price as possible.
The result, he claims, can be a hefty profit.
Such a process would only be attractive to a large company or
institution with a large tax bill. Also, from the managers' point of
view, they pick up commission on the work. Communities, on the other
hand, do not need to employ agents as they are perfectly capable of
shopping around for the best prices themselves.
If Dr Foxley is correct -- and what he describes is not illegal --
then such practices would be considered a cause for concern by
environmentalists.
Martin Mathers, of the Worldwide Fund for Nature, Scotland:''Forestry
management is quite intensive in terms of input, so we need to take a
lot of care to get a crop of high quality. A system which drives you
towards less and less management is not going to give you that and also
a system which distorts the price of timber on the market is not going
to do that either.''

JOE DONNELLY goes his mile as he mourns the passing of the Imperial
system and takes a measured look at the effects of Metric Day which
dawns tomorrow
THERE'S a good line in a scene in Braveheart, when Mel Gibson arrives
on the battlefront. ''Can't be Wallace,'' a warrior claims. ''Wallace is
seven feet tall.''
It's a double joke because the Scots guerrilla hero was a big lad, but
not that big and his legend was even larger than life. Gibson, on the
other hand, has to put up with constant evaluation of his own stature.
No midget, he'll still be Wee Mel because he's not 6ft tall, never mind
the colossal seven of his hero.
As from tomorrow, however, it will be all academic. On October 1, we
go metric. Out go feet and inches, in come centimetres and even
nanometres. Pints are passe, gallons are gone. Litres are it.
With them go a whole, ancient culture and within a couple of years,
the terms we grew up with, the way in which we measured our world, with
rulers and micrometers and yardsticks as well as with our hands and
heads will be just a fading memory.
For those who think nothing will change, think back to the seventies
when they brought in this new-fangled decimal currency. Those who grew
up with Jimi Hendrix and the Stones and everybody older than that spent
a couple of years totally befuddled, just trying to count the cost. A
packet of crisps and an MB bar was two and a half new pence. How much in
old money? A tanner. It took us ages to work out the values.
Shopkeepers, bus conductresses (now sadly extinct) and barmen were in a
state of complete confusion or irate impatience.
Bob a Job? Every Scout and Cub knew the value of money. That was five
pence new cash. A half a dollar was two and six which was 30 pennies
which was 12p. Confused? We were. We had to work at it, but we got there
in the end.
Now it's not easy to recall how we managed when virtually nothing in
life was measured in tens except for fingers and toes, or hundreds,
except for hundredweights, of which more later. But isn't our very
language the poorer for the lack of slang, coined coin phrases? No
tanner, no bob. No thrup'ny, hauf-croon, tuppence or ten-bob note.
Other subtractions are imminent. Going metric will change our whole
sense of proportion forever. Sceptics might shake their heads, but the
way we calculate what we are and the depth and breadth of our world and
how we fit into it is all down to how we learned to measure and count.
Size might not be everything, but the small Glasgow man knows six feet
tall when he sees it. It's two yards and it's pretty big. Mel Gibson is
five seven and Sean Connery is a strapping six two, or thereabouts. In
metric terms, Wee William Wallace is 1.67 metres. Sean is 1.85 metres.
Not much difference there, only a few centimetres. It's a perception
thing.
Us Scots never got into the American way of describing fugitive
ruffians in pounds. White, Caucasian, about 185 pounds officer . . . and
he went thataway. We'd say five foot, 13 stone. Small and fat. Now we'll
have to tell the gendarme the rotund mugger was 150 centimetres, 83
kilos. It's not just the same, is it? A man's 32 waist is 80cm. One is
an social comment or fashion statement and the other is a mere
measurement. We're not even getting into bras here.
We've already seen the demise of the quarter-gill pub. It's 30 mil,
and you're still being done. Ask for a quarter of cola cubes (about the
only cubic measurement we ever learned) and you find now it's 113
grammes. Two ounce of choc raisins will be a mere 0.05 of a kilo. It's
not the same, is it? Will a stone of potatoes be easier to carry than a
metric measure? Granted, they will be easier to count, in tens and
hundreds, especially on pocket calculators which automatically put the
decimal point in. Kids these days don't believe how we learned to
calculate in columns of figures headed by: T Cwt St Lb Oz. But we did,
with a ruler on the knuckles to help us along. We totted up farthings,
ha'pennies, shillings and pounds like it was second nature. Prices
weren't #9.99. They were #9, 19/11d, and that was lots of dough. We
could do complicated calculations in inches, feet and yards and miles,
despite the fact that there was 12 in one, three in another and 1760 in
the third. We knew that a rod, pole, and perch was the same thing, a
little like a surveyor's trinity and that four of them equalled a chain
which was all of 22 yards and we didn't need microprocessors for it
either. The joke was that the constipated mathematician worked it out
with a pencil.
A man's drink came in gills and maybe that's why they described it as
drinking like a fish. You never had to multiply by 4.5 to find out how
many gallons of diesel were in the tank, or divide by 1.6 to find out
how many miles you got to that gallon. The milkboy left a pint at the
door, or a quart. The coalman humphed hundredweight sacks up tenement
stairs.
We are about to lose forever our way of assessing our world. Equally
bad, if not worse, is the fact that we will also lose a whole vocabulary
in the process and our language will be the poorer for it. In a few
years' time, youngsters will look askance and puzzled when a boastful
and illegal driver tells how in the old days he was doing a ton.
What's a ton? They will ask. Doing the thousand kilogrammes will never
be the same. No longer will achievers go the extra yard. Full fathoms
five, my father lies loses its melancholy meter when he's just over nine
metres down. A mountaineer cannot centimetre along a cliff ledge. He
inches, doesn't he? At new year, we first foot. We live in God's acre
and no corner of a foreign hectare that will never be Scotland. Our
horse gains in the final furlong and wins by that other wonderful
measurement, a nose, maybe even a lip if it's closer yet. Our bag weighs
a ton. We observe that she's put on the pounds and he's 15 stone if he's
an ounce, and try saying that in any way other than avoirdupois. We have
a pint with the lads. We did hide our light under a bushel. The Royal
Mile will never be the Kilometre du Rey.
All of our measuring language will atrophy from lack of use, and we
too will be the poorer for it. It is interesting to know that the only
real image the metric system has brought us has been the one we didn't
want. The boy died after taking two grammes of heroin; police found five
kilos of cocaine; customs officers have recovered five tonnes of
cannabis. Not very poetic.
After today, though, that will be our language as some of the old
terms begin to fade from memory and the loss is ours, from our culture,
from the colour of our description and we will discover that size, and
weight and capacity really is important.
Back in 1305, nearly seven hundred years ago, the people would likely
have understood somebody who said: ''Wallace is seven feet tall.'' He
would know seven foot when he saw it, as do we.
The next generation will not have a clue.

It was so scary but at the same time exhilarating
The spectacular challenge of the trapeze has many East coast Scots
clamouring for the ropes. Jean West meets the high-fliers
THE YMCA building in Aberdeen is a dignified, finely crafted,
Gothic-style masterpiece. An icon of its age, the former Church manse
exudes ecclesiastical charm. On warm days the sun pours through its
ornate windows reflecting kaleidoscopic beams across the floor in
yellows, purples and pinks. Dull days are moody but dramatic.
When it comes to swinging upside down from the rafters -- no question,
this formidable listed building is the place to be.
Over the years the stately beamed construction has witnessed some
worthy functions. The Sunday School would have graced its pious space in
times gone by, perhaps there were fetes and women's guild meetings.
Trapeze is something new -- but the splendid hall was adopted with
aplomb.
Thanks to the innovative spirit of Scaramouch Theatre Company, the
grand interior is being perused from angles even the architect could
hardly have envisaged.
Jonathan Campbell and Niki McCretton teamed up to teach trapeze in
Scotland after meeting on a one-year circus skills course in Bristol.
After a further three months studying flying trapeze at L'Ecole De
Trapez Volant Jean Palacy in Paris, the former Scots gardener and
Somerset student embarked on a professional partnership.
They persuaded Aberdeen District Council and the City Moves Dance
project that their lofty business plans would bring excitement, usually
reserved for the Edinburgh Festival, to the Granite City, all year
round.
A number of years down the line and the company are still taking
scores of adrenaline junkies to dizzying heights to continue an
150-year-old tradition, started by the acrobat, dubbed The Daring Young
Man on the Flying Trapeze, Jules Leotard.
So, how did two young people with their feet firmly on the ground set
up what has become one of the region's most successful artistic
ventures? Jonathan aged 30, explains: ''I had been doing a string of
jobs, plumbing and gardening, etc, when I was taught to juggle and
unicycle. Later a friend persuaded me to try the course in Bristol.
''I went there with the skills I had learnt but got bored and soon
found there were much more exciting things like trapeze.''
He adds: ''I got into it because it was so scary but exhilarating at
the same time. Although I had never been particularly athletic, it was
the first time I had ever felt graceful. I enjoyed the feeling of doing
something that seemed impossible.
''I did flying trapeze in Paris, which is very different from static
trapeze, it has a lot more to do with timing and less with strength. The
momentum of the swing gives you the power to do the trick. Timing is
vital, otherwise you end up in the net -- you also have to learn how to
fall properly so that you don't miss the net altogether.''
After Paris, Jonathan and Niki moved to Scotland and started teaching
trapeze along with circus skills, clowning, theatre and improvisation.
The YMCA building on Skene Terrace was one of the few suitable
buildings, in terms of height and safety, eligible for consideration for
their work.
Jonathan says: ''We told the council we would be the first in Scotland
to teach trapeze -- it was just too unique an offer for them to refuse.
It also fit within the remit of dance -- trapeze is very physical.
''These days there's always a waiting list for the classes. We get all
kinds of people coming along. Some will be gymnasts or dancers already
but we have had sandwich-makers, painters and school kids. Many of them
were just beginners when they started.''
Sandy Noble, aged 31, a decorative artist, went along to watch his
wife April at her first trapeze class and ended up converted.
He says: ''I went to watch April and because there was a space in the
class they let me try it. I just wanted to get up there again and again.
There are so many things you can do on a trapeze -- it gives me such a
buzz.
''It's also extremely good for getting fit, I have discovered muscles
I didn't know I had. The danger doesn't really bother me, although at
first I thought it might.''
Former barman, Alan MacFarlane, aged 26, says: ''Whenever I tell
people I do trapeze they often mishear and assume I mean trampoline and
then when I explain exactly what I do they think it's fairly silly.
''We do some quite dangerous tricks but we can't really hurt ourselves
because of the precautions we take. It's very exciting.''
Niki, who now works with a different theatre company, adds: ''Many of
the people we taught had no previous experience but as kids loved
climbing trees and hanging from railings. They might have seen trapeze
in the circus and wanted to have a go.
''They would get up there and were usually terrified. Sometimes that
was enough for them and they were put off for life. The ones who got a
kick out of it would go back for more.''
Accidents and insurance are obviously a major consideration but, touch
wood, the former have been completely avoided.
''Very occasionally some people get so scared they will freeze on the
bar, which is about 12ft from the ground,'' says Jonathan.
''But we always use a lunge belt and mattress so it's not difficult to
get them down. If you don't warm up properly you can pull muscles but
there have been no great mishaps.''
Scope for movement on the static trapeze is more or less limitless.
''As soon as we have achieved one trick, there is another round the
corner, more difficult and scary,'' adds Jonathan. ''In terms of dance
movement, the trapeze is also very versatile.
Men have more upper body strength and they manage to do the tricks
quicker but not with much style.
''Women take longer to learn them but their style is much better and
they are far safer than the men. It's the macho thing with men.''
Flying trapeze is not yet among the Aberdeen school's repertoire but
some of the pupils aspire to the art.
Sandy adds: ''I'd love to do flying trapeze -- that's my ultimate aim.
It is very dangerous but if you take all the precautions and work on a
lunge belt it would be safe. That's how the tricks are taught.''
French acrobat Jules Leotard came across the concept of flying trapeze
quite by chance in the middle of the last century. His father owned a
swimming baths and gymnasium in Toulouse. One day after a workout in the
gym, the young man decided to have a swim. As he stood poised to plunge
into the pool, he noticed the cords which opened and closed the
ventilators on the roof.
They sparked an idea that if he joined the two pairs of rope with
wooden batons, he could swing between them and if he fell, the worst
that could happen was a good soaking.
Gradually the number of trapezes he used increased until on one visit
to London he used five in a line, turning single somersaults from bar to
bar. His success lasted 10 years until he died, not from a fall, but
from smallpox contracted in Spain.
Jonathan says: ''With flying trapeze your life is literally in someone
else's hands, so you have to really trust the person who is catching
you. But falling into the net is lovely too. You watch the ceiling as
you go faster and faster towards it and it catapults you back in the
air.''
Aberdeen's Dance and Movement Project founded by the city council are
thrilled with the progress made in the trapeze classes.
Claire Hayes, dance development officer, says: ''We are really pleased
to have the trapeze classes in Aberdeen. They are very popular and take
full advantage of the talent in the city. It is a new skill that has not
been taught in Aberdeen before and we are delighted with it.''
For the pupils, the trapeze can be an assertive metaphor for life too.
''If you can do trapeze you can do anything,'' maintains Jonathan. ''If
you can fall backwards and catch yourself, then picking up the telephone
to make a difficult phone call is easy. It's a real confidence
booster.''

'Right to roam would do more damage to the environment than good to
humanity'
THE last decade has been the most turbulent in the forestry industry
this century.
The Government's Forest Review last year, which stopped short of
outright privatisation largely because of opposition from the
wood-processing industry and widespread public fears over loss of
access, turned Forest Enterprise -- the commission's management division
-- into a stand-alone agency.
But a year after that review, details are still awaited over key
elements of how the reforms will work.
* the Forestry Commission's document on public access is expected
soon.
* the framework document for the new stand-alone Forest Enterprise
agency has yet to be announced.
* details of the review of the Forestry Authority, the regulatory
wing, are still awaited.
Within the commission's hierarchy, a number of changes have taken
place, or are awaited:
* a new director-general of the Forestry Commission, Australian David
Bills, will replace Robin Cutler, who has been largely credited with the
more enlightened thinking of the Commission, in December;
* the Forest Enterprise's new head, Neil McKerrow, took over only this
summer;
* David Foot has recently been appointed head of the Forestry
Authority, the regulatory arm of the Forestry Commission;
* Michael Forsyth, as Secretary of State, has replaced Ian Lang as the
Government's lead forestry minister, while the Earl of Lindsay has taken
over Sir Hector Monro's forestry brief in the Scottish Office.
In such times of change, the various sectors of forestry-related
industry are asking whether major changes will follow, or whether they
can plan ahead, confident that policy is settled.
Nevertheless, they all have their wish-lists: landowners and farmers
want assurances that the incentives to plant forestry on agricultural
land will continue or they will be unwilling to risk a long-term
commitment to woodlands; the commercial sector wants the Government to
redress the balance in a support system which it believes is heavily
weighted towards farming.
Recreation and access campaigners continue to campaign against the
Government's policy of disposals -- mainly on the ground that private
owners' record on access is far poorer than the commission's.
Lord Lindsay told the Herald that Government policy would be based on
two important strands -- looking after what we have got and making it
sustainable and useful in a multi-purpose sense, and increasing woodland
cover without planting in an insensitive way.
He said there was now a presumption against selling commission woods
where public access had a dimension and the woods were seen as a public
amenity asset.
But he showed no support for those campaigning for the ''right to
roam'', saying that such a policy would do ''more damage to the
environment than good to humanity''.
Kenny Murray, union representative of the forestry workers, believes
that the commission's public access review will use access as a
criterion for disposal. He predicts, therefore, that the bulk of the
woodlands in the South-east and South-west of England will not be sold
off, and that woodlands in the more sparsely-populated Scotland,
particularly the Highlands, will be targeted because they are under less
popular pressure.
One of the most recent estates to be advertised in the commission's
Estates Gazette as on the market is Upper Nithsdale, which covers 3723
hectares, almost 9000 acres.
Part of the same estate was advertised three years ago, but the sale
did not go ahead, for whatever reason.
However, Mr Murray now speculates that the Commission now feels more
able to advertise its Upper Nithsdale estate because the two MPs whose
constituencies straddle the forest, Ian Lang and Sir Hector Monro, are
no longer forestry Ministers.
Of the 120,000 hectares of land sold by the Commission since 1981,
71,000 hectares have been in Scotland.
Mr Murray claims that Scotland has taken the brunt of disposals -- a
claim vigorously denied by Lord Lindsay, who points out that Scotland
has considerably more Commission land than the rest of Britain. But Mr
Murray claims that one day we will wake up and find our woodlands closed
off to us.

THERE is no escape for the new leading Forestry Minister for the UK,
Michael Forsyth. He is the one who said he wanted to empower communities
to have a greater say in their futures. Now the communities who want to
own or manage their own woodlands intend to find out if he means it.
Currently, the people of Laggan are pushing their three-year-old case
to the new forestry Ministers in Scotland in the hope that fresh minds
will reach more favourable conclusions. They argue that the only way
they can prevent complete depopulation is to take over the forest that
runs through their village and work it themselves.
Dr Ian Richardson, a retired general practitioner who has become a
spokesman for the community, said: ''We have severe problems here,
common to the remoter areas in the Highlands. We have learnt that if you
lie down and wait for help from outside it does no good.
''There used to be 650 people living here, now there are less than
200.''
''Employment here is the Forestry Commission. Two belts of wood are
right within the village. They used to employ a maximum of 34 men, which
means 34 families. Two years ago there were only two left.''
The community's application was to take over the forest in any form,
management or lease, but ultimately with a view to community ownership,
which is a relatively common practice in a number of other European
countries.
Dr Richardson said that when the Forestry Commission refused to sell
to them, they appealed to Ian Lang, the then Scottish Secretary and lead
Forestry Minister, and Sir Hector Monro, Scottish Office Forestry
Minister, but achieved nothing.
''We want to create another dimension to tourism, something more than
the dodgems in Aviemore,'' said Dr Richardson.
Jim Hunter, writer, broadcaster, and champion of crofters' rights,
says he is looking for a bit of imagination on the part of the
Government.
''If they are serious about what they say about local power, and
giving communities more control of their own affairs, really they should
be moving towards breaking up the Forest Enterprise quite a bit. But
instead, they are simply selling forestry to more affluent owners and
big private concerns.''
One possibility would be to allow the Forestry Commission to retain
ownership of the land while transferring management of trees to a local
body.
''When people talk about land reform we think they are talking about
getting rid of landlords -- but it should be equally important to break
up large state monopolies and get that sort of estate back into
community hands,'' added Mr Hunter.
It works elsewhere, argue community activists. In Switzerland, most
forests are state-owned but their management is devolved down to local
level. Many of the forests of eastern France are community-owned, as is
the case in Norway and Finland.
Even in Wales, it has been proved successful. Welsh Woodlands, or Coed
Cymru, won the backing of the former Welsh Secretary John Redwood when a
local community proved they could generate real jobs from managing their
own oak-woods, setting up sawmills, and manufacturing high quality
kitchen units.
Bill Ritchie of the Assynt Crofters, points out that although the
Commission offers a Community Woodland Scheme, this enables local
communities to establish new local community woods, primarily for
recreation -- not, significantly, to become involved in the management
of existing woods.
Lord Lindsay, himself the owner of a small 70-acre woodland which he
is in the process of replanting, said: ''I do broadly support the
Secretary of State's fundamental belief that we should devolve as far as
possible to give communities as much of a say as possible -- but this
should be a partnership rather than unilaterally imposing their own
wishes on a wider landscape.''

Tom Weir, vice president of the Friends of Loch Lomond, sees an
opportunity to right two wrongs on the bonniest of Loch Lomond's banks.
THE first wrong was the failure to acknowledge for 45 years that the
eastern side of Loch Lomond was bought as a war memorial to those who
died in the Second World War, to be conserved for its beauty.
The second was failure to observe that principle by the Forestry
Commission, who instead of perpetuating the oakwoods and other native
trees which make the banks so bonny, brought out their heavy machinery
across 1100 acres, lying south and west under Ben Lomond, and planted a
forest of alien spruces, mainly Sitka, and created the eyesore seen on
the photograph (above, right).
This whole area came into Government ownership in 1950 by purchase
with money from the National Land Fund, a fund set up in 1946 by Hugh
Dalton, then Chancellor of the Exchequer. His intention was to secure
for the nation, through the agency of National Parks and the National
Trust, our finest landscapes as a memorial to those who died in the war
just ended.
The acquisition was announced in the Glasgow Herald of February 20
under the banner headline, Loch Lomond Estate For The Nation. The report
read, ''Rowardennan Estate which occupies a key position in relation to
the Loch Lomond National Park, is being bought for the nation, it was
announced by the Secretary of State for Scotland.''
Alas what we got was not a National Park, but a National Forest Park,
and the Forestry Commission became in the next few years Scotland's
biggest landowner.
The Government had so forgotten the nature of the acquisition that
under the Forestry Commission's disposal they sold Ben Lomond to the
National Trust for Scotland, who were assisted financially by the
Countryside Commission for Scotland and the National Heritage Memorial
Fund, plus money raised by public appeal. Ben Lomond then had the
doubtful distinction of being bought twice with public money.
The need for National Park protection and good management is as great
now as it was in 1946, for what we have is a Regional Park, inadequately
financed; not only starved of money, but without planning control.
We anxiously await what the new unitary local authorities intend, and
what Mr Forsyth, the Scottish Secretary, proposes, since his
constituency covers the majority of the eastern shore.
Roger Carr, chairman of the Countryside Commission before it was
merged with the Nature Conservancy Council, spoke out with feeling at a
seminar on Loch Lomond, winding up as follows: ''There is a lot going
wrong around here. Something has to be done about it. I am becoming
angry and frustrated with the Government's refusal to act. They appear
to want some voluntary body to look after this very fragile and
beautiful piece of countryside, but this is the wrong route. The case
for a National Park for Loch Lomond has been made totally and completely
today.''
How ironic that all this previous National Park information should
come to light in this year when we are commemorating the anniversary of
the end of the war 50 years ago. Perhaps this year would be an
appropriate time to declare Ben Lomond held inalienably as an inspiring
memorial, not only to those who died, but also to our commitment to
preserve its fragile landscape for the future, and set up an authority
as recommended by Sir Peter Hutchison.
The opportunity to right the second wrong has arisen because the
conifers which the Forestry Commission had to plant under pressure from
the Treasury will be due for felling very soon, and the Friends of Loch
Lomond and the National Trust for Scotland believe this highest category
of scenery should be planted with native broad-leafed trees.
The commission chose to plant mainly Sitka spruce on the flanks of Ben
Lomond because this tree of the western seaboard of North America offers
the highest yields of timber for the lowest expenditure. But it is of
limited use, and most of what is shortly to be felled will go for pulp,
paper, or reconstituted board.
From the A82 spanning the western shore, and well provided with
lay-bys, tourists have a perfect view the ugly spruce blanket on the
Rowardennan slopes.
In the Lake District, the part of England most comparable to Loch
Lomond, a combination of voluntary bodies resisted commercial
plantations as long ago as 1936, and managed to persuade the Forestry
Commission to exclude spruces from a core-area of 300 square miles,
which remains free to this day.
In proposing a replacement blanket of conifers for the commercial
Rowardennan forest, the commission is out of step with conservation
principles, especially when the money granted by the National Land Fund
was to uphold these principles.
The very idea of another 50-year cycle of commercial plantations
dominated by Sitka spruce on prominent hillsides close to Ben Lomond is
deplorable.

ON the day before the Old Firm fixture partitioned the city, Glasgow's
football divide manifested itself in the stock markets.
After the end of the arrangement yesterday, under which many clubs had
previously traded their shares, Celtic joined the publicly-listed
Alternative Investment Market while Rangers opted for a private
arrangement.
Celtic share prices will now be listed daily in the Financial Times
and on Stock Market computer screens, and strict regulations enforced by
the London Stock Exchange will apply to trading.
They are the first Scottish club to join the index and will trade
alongside businesss such as Scottish Pride, United Auctions, and the Old
English Pub Company.
Mr Hugh Nash, director of Celtic's stockbrokers Greig Middleton &amp; Co,
said the move, promised under the club's original #14m share issue,
would bring added security to shareholders with the public regulation of
trading.
''The club must now keep the shareholders informed and maintain
restrictions as far as the trading acts of directors are concerned. It
must also stop the release of insider information regarding
activities.''
Rangers shares will now be bought and sold on a ''match bargain''
basis, whereby a private regulator, the London-based Jenkins company,
will act as intermediary between traders.
A financial spokesman for the club last night said that moving to the
AIM market would have been ''too costly''.
He added: ''Rangers looked at it very closely but decided that, for
various reasons, there was no advantage to be gained by joining AIM. The
club is more than happy about the way shares are traded at the moment
and will continue to use a similar system.''

SCOTLAND'S last remaining passenger and car ferry service to the Isle
of Man faces the axe because of a lack of business.
The service between Ardrossan and Douglas has operated each Saturday
for 15 weeks, from the end of May until September, for the past two
years. However, the operators say it has been running at less than
one-third capacity.
It is expected that Caledonian MacBrayne, which runs the service on
behalf of the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company, will confirm at a board
meeting in Stornoway next week that it no longer intends to service the
route because it is not ''well supported''.
A ferry service between Ardrossan and Douglas ran for 150 years until
1986. However, it was transferred to Stranraer and operated until 1990,
when the IoM Steam Packet Company blamed operating costs on its
withdrawal.
CalMac has been using the MV Claymore on the Douglas route for the
past two years. The vessel can carry 300 passengers and 50 cars, and
takes eight hours to complete the journey.
A CalMac spokesman would only say yesterday: ''Other than a few weeks,
the route has not been well supported. A decision will be made one way
or another at our next board meeting.''
A spokesman for the IoM Steam Packet Company could not confirm
yesterday that the service faced the axe, although he said a ''question
mark'' did remain over its future operation.
The company's schedules for next year would not be completed for
another four to six weeks.
The spokesman added: ''The service between Ardrossan and Douglas has
not generated the traffic we had hoped for, and has been running at less
than one-third capacity.''
He said passengers visiting the Isle of Man from Scotland appeared to
prefer using the company's service from Heysham in Lancashire which was
more frequent and quicker.
The spokesman said that if CalMac had more profitable work for the
Claymore then it would reduce the likelihood of the service operating
next year.
Labour MP Brian Wilson, whose Cunninghame North constituency embraces
Ardrossan, said the Douglas service had been ''a very welcome
innovation'' which should be built on to expand services from the
Ayrshire town.
The MP said it would be a retrograde step if the service disappeared.
He called for a decision on its future to be postponed to allow time for
discussions between local politicians, Ayrshire Tourist Board and other
interested bodies which might be able to promote it more effectively.

THE National Audit Office has passed papers to the Crown Office about
allegations regarding the Glasgow-based Student Loans Company.
Mr Robert Maclennan, the Liberal Democrat MP for Caithness and
Sutherland and a member of the Public Accounts Committee, said yesterday
that he has received a letter from Sir John Bourn, Comptroller and
Auditor General, about allegations regarding the company.
In his letter, Sir John, who heads the National Audit Office, reveals
that he has passed papers to the Crown Office which relate to the award
of an IT contract by the company.
He also states that his staff have received full co-operation from the
company in their investigations.
Commenting on the letter, Mr Maclennan, who wrote to Mr Bourn
concerning allegations he had received about the company, said: ''It is
reassuring that the new management have encouraged staff to be
completely open with the investigators. Sir Eric Ash is to be commended
for encouraging a culture of openness in the company.
''I hope the Crown Office will act promptly to resolve the allegations
regarding the awarding of IT contracts, so that the matter can finally
be concluded.''

A BRIDEGROOM needed life-saving surgery after his brother stabbed him
through the heart on his wedding day.
Yesterday, however, a judge showed mercy to the man who carried out
the attack which nearly cost his brother's life.
At the High Court in Edinburgh, Lord Weir ordered Stephen Leonard, 28,
to carry out 200 hours community service.
The judge had deferred sentence for background reports on Leonard, of
Aberfeldy Street, Dennistoun, Glasgow, after he appeared at the High
Court in Glasgow earlier this month.
Leonard admitted stabbing his brother John, 31, of Lentran Street,
Easterhouse, to his severe injury, permanent impairment, and the danger
of his life in September last year.
The incident took place after John Leonard was thrown out of his own
wedding reception following a quarrel on the River Clyde disco boat
Tuxedo Princess.
Lord Weir was told that John had been drunk and grabbed Stephen by the
throat after they left the reception and continued to provoke him after
they got back to the house in Easterhouse.
Stephen ended up stabbing his brother 10 times with a potato knife and
John was taken to hospital for emergency surgery.
Mrs Valerie Stacey, Advocate-depute, told the court: ''It was
discovered that he had a wound to his heart. Surgeons could not wait to
get him to the operating theatre and had to perform an operation in the
ward.''
Lord Weir told Stephen Leonard yesterday that he had considered
sending him to prison but accepted that he had been considerably
provoked by his brother and thought a prison sentence would serve no
useful purpose.
The judge said he had decided to exercise leniency because Stephen had
recently been promoted in his job and the family, including the victim
of the attack, had forgiven him for what he had done.
He added: ''No useful purpose would be served in sending you to prison
and it seems to me the ends of justice will be served by another
approach.''

<HEADLINE>Guidelines issued on flood prevention</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>DUNCAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>5</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>976126254</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
SCOTTISH Secretary Michael Forsyth yesterday issued planners and
builders with new national guidelines on preventing flood damage to
future housing and other developments.
The move follows a series of floods across Scotland, particularly the
North-east and Strathclyde, in recent months.
The guidelines say that planning applications can be refused on the
grounds of flood risk. Some developments will get the go-ahead from
local authorities only if flood prevention measures are taken.
They also recognise the leading role of the local authorities and
their powers to maintain watercourses and prepare flood prevention
schemes, and the role of river purification authorities (from April next
year, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency) in monitoring flood
water and providing advice on flood risk.
Mr Forsyth said: ''The purpose of these guidelines is to highlight the
powers and responsibilities that rest with local authorities, outline
additional planning measures, and generally emphasise the part I expect
them to play in dealing with the risk of flooding in the future.
''In areas most at risk, new development should be avoided. In other
areas of risk, development may be possible only if there are flood
prevention measures, including action to make buildings more water
resistant.''
He added that flooding was a natural phenomenon and, irrespective of
whether there were prevention schemes, it was impossible to give
absolute guarantees about where it would occur, its frequency or
severity.
''Local authorities have been given wide-ranging powers to carry out
flood prevention work and to control development but these cannot take
away from the owners of land or property the usual responsibilities
which ownership brings. I expect developers and planning authorities to
heed this guidance and that less property will be built which is
threatened by flooding.''
In addition to the guidelines, the Scottish Office has commissioned a
guidance note for designers and builders on measures which can be taken
to make dwellings more resistant to flood water.
Although the guidelines become policy immediately, their real impact
will come through the new unitary local authorities which will replace
regional and district councils from April.
The most recent floods to have hit Scotland were in the North-east,
where torrential rain struck earlier this month. In July, Renfrew was
one of many parts of Strathclyde to suffer flooding for the second time
in seven months.
At Renfrew District Council yesterday, acting managing director Ian
Snodgrass said: ''The authority will welcome this additional guidance.''
A Strathclyde region spokesman concurred and said that part of the
previous problems had involved houses built in areas prone to flooding.

LEADING Scots Tory Daphne Sleigh last night pledged to continue her
fight to convince party chiefs to change their minds on the issue of how
much savings pensioners could have before they got free or subsidised
nursing home care.
Her comments came after it was revealed that a motion put forward on
the issue to the Tory Party conference in Blackpool by her local
constituency branch next month will not be debated.
However, Councillor Sleigh said the fact it had been even mentioned
was a step in the right direction and she did not look on it as a major
setback.
Councillor Sleigh, Tory leader on Edinburgh District Council, has
petitioned party chiefs long and hard on the care cost for the elderly.
Her attempts led to Prime Minister John Major announcing last month his
Downing Street policy unit was reviewing nursing home cash limits.
People in nursing or residential homes with savings of #3000 have to
contribute towards the cost of care. If they have #8000 or more, they
have to pay for the full cost.
Some pensioners who go into nursing homes have to sell their homes to
pay for care, while others lose their life-time savings.
Councillor Sleigh suggested a number of alternative arrangements to
ease OAPs financial burdens, including increasing the threshold for
payment from #8000 to #50,000.
She said: ''I am certain it will be discussed by people in the
corridors and the bars at the conference. It will certainly not be
forgotten.
Councillor Sleigh added: ''This is a very important issue. It was good
that the matter was put forward as a motion and it is a pity it is not
being discussed. However, I do not see this as a setback and I believe
Mr Major will change the system once the review is completed.''
A spokesman for Tory Party central office in London confirmed the
motions on the issue had been put forward by Edinburgh Pentlands
Association but would not be debated. She added that other motions from
English Tory Associations on the same point had also been put forward
but would not be debated either.
Councillor Sleigh's attempt to put a motion to the Scottish
Conservative conference in May was blocked on procedural grounds, a move
which angered her at the time as she believed there was a clear mood
among delegates that change was needed because the current system was
hurting the party among supporters.
Her speech at the Scottish conference in Glasgow caught the mood of
delegates who would undoubtedly have passed her motion had it been put
to the vote.
Councillor Sleigh said at the time: ''What happened to helping those
who help themselves, rewarding effort, diligence, self-reliance?''

Hospital chiefs offer support for finance director who resigned over
#2m funding deficit
THE chief executive of Aberdeen Royal Hospitals Trust -- which is
around #2m short of the funding required for the current financial year
-- last night defended the director of finance whose resignation was
made public following the disclosure of its financial difficulties.
Mr Alex Cumming said the trust wished to repeat the regret expressed
when announcing the resignation of Mr Douglas Lindsay, from March 1996.
The trust has indicated that senior staff were told of Mr Lindsay's
resignation on September 21 but it was announced publicly only this
week.
In last night's statement, Mr Cumming said the trust regretted the
''unfounded criticism'' of Mr Lindsay, and wished to confirm that his
professional competence, integrity, and commitment were unquestioned.
The trust so far has refused to face the press.
In a separate statement last night, Mr Cumming, with trust chairman
Bryan Broomfield, and staff representative John McKinnon, said they
greatly regretted the leaking of confidential correspondence between Mr
Geoff Scaife, chief executive of the NHS in Scotland, and the chairman,
which had resulted in a good deal of misunderstanding and ''ill-founded
speculation in the media''.
The letter from Mr Scaife revealed the deficit which the trust faces,
and asked it to submit an externally validated recovery plan by the end
of September.
In the letter, Mr Scaife also said he expected the trust board would
be considering whether the director of finance had its confidence and,
if not, what action was to be taken.
Last night's statement outlined the trust's position and said it had
achieved its financial targets last year only because of short-term
funding from Grampian Health Board. Since then, costs had escalated for
a number of essential services.
The statement said staff productivity was high in terms of Scottish
comparisons and costs were significantly below the average for teaching
hospitals in Scotland. However, it had undertaken to save another #1m
with a package of measures introduced in July.
It stated that future strategy included the assumption it would make
further savings. The trust made the health board aware of concerns over
funding in December last year, and discussions had continued with
purchasers -- including Grampian Health Board, which had helped with
what funding it could, some on a non-recurring basis.
It had also made the management executive aware, and sought help and
advice, when it became clear it was around #2m short of what it felt was
required, and what purchasers could make available.
The management executive had asked for a financial plan for the next
two years to demonstrate how it would balance income and expenditure.
The statement added: ''We have agreed this plan will be available by
the end of October.'' It was being examined by the trust's auditors and
wanted to ensure future activity was supported by recurring funding.
''The short-term funding made available in 1993/94 and 1994/95, and in
the current year, is not a satisfactory means of achieving responsible
financial planning.''
The statement said staff representatives had been made aware of the
situation as it developed and had made it clear they were ''fully in
support of the entire trust board in its endeavours to make good the
situation.''
Mr Cumming said: ''Finally, I reiterate the assurance given at the
beginning of August that, based on my understanding of the undertakings
given by the management executive, there will be no short-term threat to
the patient services or to the staff employed by the trust.
''If we achieve the efficiency savings we have agreed to make, we will
be able to continue, and improve, the services we offer.''
The statement indicates there will be a press conference on Monday.

Mentally ill and aged 'will be deprived of care they need' with
reorganisation.
MENTALLY ill and old people in the South Side of Glasgow will be
deprived of the care they need if current proposals to reorganise the
service are put into effect, health union Unison claimed yesterday.
The proposals in the consultation paper issued by Greater Glasgow
Health Board and the Community and Mental Health Trust range from vague
and confusing to downright misleading, Unison said in a written
response.
At the heart of the plan is the reduction of Leverndale psychiatric
hospital to a small unit for long-stay patients. It aims to shed 264
beds over the next two years, with more than 100 acute and intensive
psychiatric care beds going to a new unit at Victoria Infirmary.
Continuing care services for adults and the elderly will also be
affected, with 140 beds to go by 1997, and the future of the remaining
177 to be the subject of long-term review.
Although the union welcomed many of the objectives behind the
care-in-the-community policy on which the proposals are based, it said
the reality fell considerably short of the health board's inflated
claims for the strategy.
''This is clearly demonstrated in the east and the north of Glasgow,
where the strategy is well advanced,'' says the Unison response. ''As
far as long-stay patients are concerned, the 'community model' usually
means being privatised in soulless, large, institutionalised nursing
homes.''
Real community support was under-resourced and acute in-patient
services were under real pressure. When staff at the sharp end raised
these problems with health board representatives, said the union, they
were given the very clear message that the only model that mattered was
a financial one.
In support of its criticisms, Unison cites the recent report of the
Scottish Health Advisory Service on the five partnership homes in the
city, which, as The Herald revealed earlier this week, criticised them
as too big and inadequately staffed.
''It is a great pity that the health board's recent adoption of a
policy of openness did not include the full publication of this
report,'' says Unison.
The report also criticises what it says is a dogmatic preference by
the board for locating acute psychiatry beds in general hospitals -- the
proposals include closing 108 acute psychiatry beds at Leverndale and
transferring most of them to the Victoria Infirmary and the rest to
Southern General Hospital.
''There are two differing views on the siting of these facilities. The
first argues that patients with acute mental illness should be treated
in general hospitals on the basis that this normalises their treatment
and reduces the stigma that has traditionally been attached to
psychiatric conditions.
''The second argues that busy general hospitals do not provide the
best setting for treatment and that patients with a mental illness
require the more relaxing environment that can be provided in
appropriately sited specialist units.''
Unison acknowledges merit in both arguments and calls for a more
balanced provision which would allow both environments to be evaluated
and give patients a real choice.
It suggests that the unit planned for the Victoria should be sited at
a specialised location, for which the board need look no further than
Leverndale.
The health board's concern for geographical balance in opting for the
Victoria had some validity but Unison suspected that the policy had more
to do with the fact that the trust could ''realise some significant
capital receipts'' if the ground at Leverndale were available for sale.
Unison also expressed concern that linking acute mental illness
services to general hospitals could lead to them being managed by
general hospital trusts, a step backwards to the days when they were the
''Cinderella'' services of the NHS.
Unison regional officer Dave Watson said: ''Real community care
requires services which are simply not available in Glasgow. These
proposals are the continuation of a policy for the city which does not
command public support.
''The board should stop and think again before subjecting more
patients and the community to the often fatal consequences of this
policy.
''Put bluntly, these patients are to be privatised like hundreds of
others before them into the new large-scale private institutions.''

SUSAN Christie, who killed the wife of her army captain lover, was
yesterday driven to freedom in the back of a white prison van.
It sped out through the gates of Maghaberry prison near Lisburn,
County Antrim, just before 8am. It is understood that Christie, 27, then
met relatives.
She said she planned to stay in Northern Ireland but admitted: ''I
know everything will not be rosy. I know I'll have trouble getting a
job. I'll have trouble no matter where I move.''
Christie, a former UDR Greenfinch, was released after serving four and
a half years for killing Mrs Penny McAllister, 24.
She attacked her with a knife as they walked through a forest in
County Down after Mrs McAllister's husband, Captain Duncan McAllister,
said he wanted to end their secret nine-month affair.
It is understood Christie is planning to take a holiday and then start
looking for a job.
Before her release, she spoke of her deep remorse for the pain and
heartache she caused.
Mrs McAllister's parents are angry at her freedom.
Retired schoolmaster Mr Desmond Squire, 54, from Arundel, Sussex,
said: ''I hope what she did haunts her to the grave and beyond.''

DETECTIVES are expected to return from the Falkland Islands within the
next few days, following the release of four men questioned over the
disappearance of a Royal Marine 15 years ago.
The islanders were detained on suspicion of murdering 19-year-old Alan
Addis, who disappeared following a party at a remote settlement on the
South Atlantic islands. His body was never found and an inquest recorded
an open verdict.
A file on the new investigation will be prepared for Falklands police
chief, Superintendent Ken Greenland, by Detective Chief Inspector Bob
Pennington, who led the four-man team from Devon and Cornwall Police.
It is anticipated that Mr Greenland and the island's Attorney General
will study the findings of the month-long investigation and the
interviews conducted by the Devon and Cornwall officers.
The four middle-aged men were freed on bail to appear at Stanley
police station at a later date, after being questioned for more than 24
hours by the officers, who flew 8000 miles to help with the case.
Police in the Falklands called in the West Country force, with which
it has training links, after their own renewed two-year investigation
into the case.
That investigation came after a long personal campaign by the missing
soldier's mother, Ann Addis, 53, from Wrawby, Humberside, who has
visited the Falklands twice.

FORMER Rangers footballer Mark Hateley yesterday spoke of his sadness
and disappointment at the loss of several prized items of football
memorabilia which were stolen from his home.
The haul included 20 England international caps, five Scottish League
championship medals, three Scottish Cup medals, three league cup medals,
and an Adidas Golden Boot, awarded to the player for being Europe's top
goal scorer.
Hateley held a hurriedly arranged news conference yesterday in the
front garden of his eight-bedroom mock-Tudor home in Helensburgh to talk
of his despair at the theft.
The home, which includes security gates with video, was advertised for
sale this week after the player confirmed a move to Queen's Park Rangers
in London.
Hateley said the theft was the lowest point of his 18-year career as a
professional footballer.
The player emphasised that the stolen items were of ''tremendous
sentimental value'' to his family. He said he had been advised by police
that they would be of little value to anyone else.
The memorabilia was taken from a built-in display cabinet in a
downstairs study, in what appeared to be a well-planned exercise, some
time between 10.30pm on Thursday and 5.30am yesterday.
Hateley said he was mystified at how the thieves could have evaded his
''expensive security system'' and labrador, Sam, and bulldog, Jock, who
were sleeping in the room next to the study.
He said six adults, including his wife, his father and mother-in-law,
and their two friends, and his four children, aged from six to 14, who
stayed in the house on Thursday night had not been disturbed in any way.
Nothing else had been stolen although there were other valuable items
in the house.
The player said he had enjoyed his spell at Ibrox. ''I am very sad,
very disappointed, and very upset at what has happened. I have had a
great five years and it is ending like this.''
Rangers midfield star Paul Gascoigne is understood to have shown an
interest in buying Hateley's house, which is valued at about #375,000.

TWO parents and three teachers from Portree High School spent last
night in jail, or to be more precise the dungeon of Dunvegan Castle. It
was an attempt to get its master John Macleod of Macleod, the Chief of
Clan Macleod, to intercede on their behalf and win a new #11.5m
secondary school for the island.
After a public campaign two years ago about the state of the island's
only senior secondary, a new school for Skye was put in Highland
Regional Council's building plans in the autumn of 1993.
There are growing fears on the island that, with continued spending
cuts, the start date, which already is likely to be well into the next
century, is being moved back all the time.
In their petition to the chief, the ''prisoners'' make clear that a
continued policy of make-do-and-mend has brought them to this pass and
cannot be allowed to go on any longer. Only a new school on a new site
will suffice.
The petition was signed by Portree High teachers/inmates Andrew
McMorrine, Donald Farquhar Macdonald, and Angus MacRuary and parents
Donald Maclean and Duncan Macdonald.
The Macleod could not be contacted at Dunvegan yesterday, which begged
the question who would let the five petitioners out this morning.
Meanwhile, a spokesman for Highland Regional Council said it would
take a specific grant from the Scottish Office to bring forward the
building of a school at Portree.
The council received only #3.7m a year for school building and had
just opened the new #3.3m Kinlochbervie High School. The spokesman
added: ''Ullapool is next and then there is the new Ardnamurchan High
School. There is also great concern about the state of Lochaber High
School in Fort William.''

SALMON farmers have given a roasting to a British Meat advert which
they say implies that sirloin steak is healthier than their fish.
The Scottish Salmon Growers' Association is planning to write to the
Advertising Standards Authority to complain about the ad which has been
placed in newspapers by the Meat and Livestock Commission.
Mr William Crowe, SSGA chief executive, said yesterday: ''This ad is
totally misleading. It states that a grilled salmon steak contains
marginally more fat than a lean grilled sirloin steak, which is true,
but what it does not say is that 80% of the fat found in salmon is
polyunsaturated and about 30% of that is omega-3 polyunsaturated, the
type that is good for you and which beef lacks.''
Professor John Sargent of Stirling University, an authority on fish
oils, said: ''With this ad, British Meat is contradicting expert opinion
in the UK, for example the British Nutrition Foundation Report of 1992,
which advises that we should be reducing our intake of saturated fats,
replacing them where possible with mono-unsaturated and polyunsaturated
oils.''
A spokeswoman for the Meat and Livestock Commission said: ''We are not
knocking salmon in the advert. We are trying to position meat beside
salmon as a healthy food. We are not saying don't eat salmon.
''But the main piece of advice the Government is giving at the moment
is to reduce total fat. Salmon has a little bit more total fat.''

'String of lies' led to bogus marriage.
A POLICEMAN who went through a wedding ceremony with a woman detective
while still married to his first wife was jailed for 18 months
yesterday.
Liverpool Crown Court heard how Kenneth Williams kept up a double life
for more than nine years, telling a string of lies to his wife, his
girlfriend, and his police superiors as he tried to cover his tracks.
The ceremony he went through with Detective Constable Debbie Wolfenden
at St Stephen's United Reform Church in Woolton, Liverpool, on June 4,
last year was ''the cruellest deception of all'', the court was told.
Williams, 35, of Childwall, Liverpool, pleaded guilty to falsely
representing that he was a bachelor to obtain a marriage certificate and
to two other deception charges, but denied a charge of attempted bigamy
which was left on the file.
The officer sat with his head bowed as the astonishing story of his
nine-year trail of deceit unfolded.
The judge said offences of bigamy and associated matters usually
happened when a man had been apart from his wife for many years and went
through a marriage ceremony with his new girlfriend.
''This offence and sequence of facts seems to me to be very different.
I have to have regard to the effect on Debbie Wolfenden, who I don't
hesitate to describe as the victim of a level of deception which was
grave, prolonged, and damaging.''
The judge said it was remarkable that his wife had supported him and
he must be grateful for that, because his wife and son Stuart, a
12-year-old cystic fibrosis sufferer, were also victims.
Mr Geoffrey Lowe, prosecuting, said Williams married in March 1979,
becoming a father in 1982. He and DC Wolfenden served together on the
same section at Copperas Hill police station in Liverpool.
They formed a relationship in 1985 and, between then and his bogus
marriage, Williams repeatedly managed to persuade Miss Wolfenden to
continue it.
At one point, Williams told her that his wife had a brain tumour and
the prognosis was poor. He also informed his superiors in the police
that his wife was ill and was given compassionate leave.
''The defendant invented an entirely deceitful family history. Among
the other lies, he claimed that his mother lived alone and his father
was a patient in a mental hospital,'' Mr Lowe said.
During 1993, Williams and Miss Wolfenden looked for a home together
but because Williams said delays in a divorce had tied up #17,000 of his
capital, it was she who paid the #250 deposit on a new house.
By Christmas 1993, he was effectively leading two lives, deceiving his
wife and Miss Wolfenden.
The wedding date was set for June 4, 1994, and the defendant
consistently said he had little money because of the divorce
proceedings.
On May 27, he went to Liverpool registry office to apply for a
marriage certificate and wedding licence, telling the registrar to enter
his status as ''bachelor'' and signed it.
Miss Wolfenden took the certificate to the registry office and was
told that they could not in law be married because of a mistake. The
minister agreed to carry out a ceremony in which a word would be omitted
so that it would not be recognised in law as a valid marriage.
The ceremony took place with the congregation unaware that it was not
an actual wedding.
''To Miss Wolfenden, it was the happiest day of her life,'' said Mr
Lowe.
''It was to all intents and purposes a complete marriage,'' said Mr
Lowe.
Williams continued with his deception, claiming he had lost airline
tickets for their honeymoon, until
he eventually confessed to Miss Wolfenden that he had been living a
double life and was not divorced.
Williams had told her: ''I love you. I'm a coward. I'm sick. I'll get
help.''
Williams then admitted to his wife that he had been involved with Miss
Wolfenden.
Mr David Boulton, defending, said the deception offences had not been
committed to gain money.
Mr Boulton said Williams had shown remorse towards Miss Wolfenden and
her family and described Williams' wife Patricia's attitude as ''almost
astonishing'' and that though she was not in court today she remained
supportive of him.
Mr Boulton said Williams had been suspended on full pay by the police
but had also been signed off as medically unfit by the force doctor, who
took the view that he should be retired on medical grounds.
He said that whether he was dismissed or suspended, Williams faced
unemployment and would probably return to his former trade as a
bricklayer.
Neither Miss Wolfenden nor Mrs Williams was in court to see Williams
jailed.
Miss Wolfenden's father, who watched the proceedings from the public
gallery, left court refusing to comment.

DUNDEE University chiefs yesterday criticised Mr Brian MacKinnon, who
posed as schoolboy Brandon Lee, and defended their decision not to allow
him to continue with his medical studies.
Professor Denis McDivitt, dean of the faculty of medicine, said that
he had no sympathy for Mr MacKinnon and added he was ''greatly
concerned'' that he had been able to gain access to the medical school
by supplying false information.
He added: ''The public expect the medical profession to demonstrate
both knowledge and integrity and we are, therefore, obliged to take
those standards into account when selecting candidates for training.''
Professor McDivitt said that his decision was ''irrevocable''.
He continued: ''We have a maximum of 130 places for medicine in any
year and we receive 2000 applications. A large number of people not
admitted would have the necessary academic qualifications.''
Professor McDivitt said that the decision to refuse admission to Mr
MacKinnon was his alone but added that he had consulted with senior
colleagues and that not one of them was in favour of allowing Mr
MacKinnon to return.

Take-up campaign releases #640,000 in benefits.
A SINGLE mother gained #29,000 in backdated benefit and disability
living allowance for her asthmatic daughter who has a serious food
allergy during a benefits take-up campaign, it was disclosed yesterday.
Easterhouse Citizens Advice Bureau has secured more than #640,000 for
local residents in the past year, mostly in additional benefits from the
Department of Social Security.
The CAB said the money was gained through raising awareness of
entitlements, targeting vulnerable groups, and encouraging the take-up
of appropriate benefits.
A total of #142,000 in additional benefits for local claimants was
also won after a home visiting project which started in January with
Urban Aid funding, while a further #200,000 is expected by the end of
the year following a disability allowance take-up campaign.
This could increase the total secured for claimants in Easterhouse to
almost #1m this year.
Ms Loretta Gaffney, manager of the Easterhouse CAB, said management
and staff were delighted that they had released so much money into the
local economy.
She urged local residents to make use of the CAB service, which is
provided by six staff and 35 voluntary advice workers, and said many
people were still losing out because they were not aware of their full
entitlement.
''There are various reasons why this is happening but one is that
application forms for benefits such as disability living allowance are
complex, difficult to complete, and off-putting given their length,
which is sometimes up to 50 pages.''
The largest amount secured was a #22,000 back-dated attendance
allowance to the single mother for the care of her 12-year-old daughter
and a further #7000 in backdated supplementary benefit.
The woman, who declined to be named, took her case to Easterhouse CAB
in April 1994 after she had been awarded backdated supplementary benefit
and disability living allowance for her daughter, and wanted her benefit
to be checked.
Easterhouse CAB said that, because the woman had not received the
proper benefit for 12 years, it requested an ex-gratia payment from the
Benefits Agency for loss of benefit during this period.
The CAB then checked through what it called a maze of regulations and
discovered that, by linking the supplementary benefit claim as a claim
for attendance allowance, the woman could be entitled to an award for
backdated benefit from 1986.
The matter was concluded after the woman was awarded an attendance
allowance payment backdated to 1986 and Easterhouse CAB wrote for a
further ex-gratia payment for loss of benefit, which was awarded in
June.
The woman, whose daughter suffers from asthma and a food allergy which
requires hospital treatment, said she was delighted to receive the money
but would have preferred to have received it at the time to help during
the early years of bringing up her daughter.
Ms Gaffney said it was CAB policy to ask every client if they were in
receipt of benefit and whether they wished a benefit check to ensure
that they were receiving all they were entitled to.
''We would then encourage them to claim the benefits that they are not
receiving and, if it is refused, we would go on to offer them
representation at an appeal where their chances of success when people
come to the CAB are very high.''
Easterhouse CAB's annual report, which will be presented to its annual
general meeting on Monday, states that the bureau had a total of 11,500
inquiries during the past year, with the voluntary advice workers
dealing with 1100 active cases at any one time.

FOUR young children and their divorced father were found dead in his
fume-filled car yesterday.
Mr Philip Mitchell, 36, had collected the children, aged between six
and nine, from school in Northwich, Cheshire, on Thursday, while their
mother Linda went out.
A worker found Mitchell's red Ford Fiesta in a car park in nearby
Middlewich 16 hours later. A hosepipe was found connected to the
exhaust, the engine of the car was still running.
The children Jonathan, nine, Catheryne seven, and six-year-old twins
Jessica and Christopher, lay in their school uniforms with their father
in the driving seat.
Police said they were not looking for anyone in connection with the
deaths.
Mitchell, of Arbour Close, Rudheath, Northwich, divorced his wife two
months ago but was said by police to have had a good relationship after
15 years of marriage.
Post-mortem examinations were carried out last night. There were no
signs of any injuries on the children, police said.
Police are now trying to piece together Mitchell's movements since he
picked up the children from Church Walk Primary School in Northwich at
3.30pm on Thursday.
Mitchell lived alone in a one-bedroom, rented flat on the ground floor
of a modern two-storey block in Arbour Close, Rudheath, Northwich.
Before moving to the flat, he had lived at a hostel for the homeless
nearby in Rudheath. The hostel, like the flat, is run by the Muir Group
Housing Association.
His wife, in her early thirties, had remained at the family home with
the four children after their divorce.
Mrs Mitchell, who reported the children missing when her former
husband failed to return them at 8pm, was being consoled by her close
family, police, and victim support councillors last night.
''She is distraught. We all feel very sorry for her,'' said Mr
Buckley. ''She has my sympathy and the sympathy of all my officers. She
is bearing up well in the circumstances, but she is very, very upset.''

MEMBERS of a camera crew filming an episode of the Glasgow police
series Taggart yesterday chased a man thought to have carried out an
armed robbery at a flower shop.
The man threatened staff at the Flower Dell, Dumbarton Road,
Clydebank, with what appeared to be a handgun before running off towards
Miller Street with a three figure sum of money. No-one was injured
during the robbery.
The film crew, who were in a side street beside the shop, realised
what was happening when a shop worker shouted for help. Several members
of the production crew gave chase but lost the man.
It is thought actors dressed in police uniforms may have scared off a
second man in a getaway car.
A police spokesman said: ''This was a potentially dangerous situation
but the production crew were probably not aware he was thought to have a
handgun.
''They are using the Clydebank area for filming. It is ironic that a
robbery was taking place 30 yards from where a crime programme was being
filmed.
''It was a public-spirited deed to give assistance to members of the
public. They reacted quickly to the situation which had left shop staff
terrified at this man's actions. They made an effort to catch him but he
had a good start.
''The person may have seen the TV vans and thought that would be a
distraction but I don't think he was aware that they were filming for
Taggart.''
The man is described as 20-35, with a stocky build, short dark brown
or black straight hair, and a bad acne scar on his face. He was wearing
a navy jacket and light trousers.
Before the incident, he was seen in a beige Vauxhall Astra car near
the shop. A second man, aged around 40, of medium build and with dark
curly hair, was also seen in the car.
The crew were filming an episode called Dead Man's Chest for the new
Taggart series to be shown next year. The episode is about treasure
being hidden following a robbery.

A MISSING shotgun used by convicted killer James Baigrie 13 years ago,
was discovered earlier this week by a man out walking his dog.
The weapon with which Baigrie shot barman Ron Lockhart, 40, during a
raid on an Edinburgh pub, was discovered along with five cartridges in
undergrowth on the edge of Blairadam Forest, near the murderer's former
home at Centre Street, Kelty, Fife.
Yesterday, Detective Chief Inspector John Nicholson, one of the
detectives who arrested Baigrie for the brutal murder, said: ''It's
amazing that this weapon has turned up after all these years.''
Mr Nicholson, who was a detective sergeant when Baigrie was arrested,
added: ''We searched for that gun for days in Blairadam and elsewhere.
We even partially emptied a reservoir and had divers looking for it, but
there was no trace.
''At one time we feared Baigrie had it when he was on the run, or it
might still be in the hands of an associate, but it has obviously lain
undisturbed for all these years.
''Although it is rusty, it could have been made useable again and I am
extremely relieved that this mystery has been solved and that the gun
has been recovered. We were always worried it could end up back on the
street.''
He said that during the search for the gun, police discovered 68
sticks of dynamite, which Baigrie had stolen from Lassodie Mine, in
Fife, and hidden in a bag in Kelty.
Also hidden with the firearm in a black bin bag was a driving licence
stolen with the getaway car used by Baigrie and 18-year-old John Wilson
in the robbery at the St Vincent Bar, in April 1982.
Baigrie, who was 30 at the time of the raid, was soon arrested and
jailed for life by Lord Hunter at the High Court in Edinburgh.
At the time, Wilson, who was sentenced to six years' detention for his
part in the raid, took police to Blairadam Forest where they found
overalls, masks, and keys, but the hiding place of the shotgun remained
Baigrie's secret.
Ten weeks after being sentenced, on October 16, 1983, Baigrie escaped
from Saughton Prison.
Using a smuggled hacksaw he cut through a cell window bar, then risked
his life crawling along a narrow ledge for about 40ft, before descending
60ft down a drainpipe and cutting through a metal fence with wirecutters
to escape.
He had dressed in a track suit and trainers in the hope of being
mistaken for a jogger. His ruse worked and he faded into the night. For
16 months, the ''desperate and dangerous'' Baigrie was on the run,
evading a massive nationwide police manhunt.
In March 1985, he was traced to a van parked in Philbeath Gardens,
London, and police laid seige for two days. Fearing Baigrie might kill
again, marksmen fired two CS gas cannisters into the vehicle before
closing in, only to hear the shot as Baigrie killed himself.

THE Tories are still intent on privatising Scotland's water services,
Lothian region's Labour convener, Councillor Eric Milligan, warned
yesterday when he opened the new #6m North Berwick Sewage Disposal
Scheme.
Councillor Milligan said that in providing water services the most
important thing was the basic right of people to have access to clean
water, as much of it as they wanted, whenever they wanted it and at a
reasonable charge.
''We must ensure that right is protected and is not forgotten in the
Government's rush to remove responsibility for water services from
democratically elected local authorities,'' he said.
If there should be another Conservative Government after the next
General Election then it was highly likely that the next step it took
would be to privatise Scotland's water in the same way it had done in
England, he claimed.
Three new water authorities, with members appointed by the Secretary
of State, are set to take over the running of water services in Scotland
after next April.
Councillor Milligan said the opening of the sewage works marked the
completion of the last major project in Lothian Regional Council's
scheme to end the discharge of raw sewage along Lothian's coastline.
The council had been able to tackle the problem at a strategic level
and around #180m had been spent over the last 20 years to alleviate this
coastal pollution.
The new treatment works at North Berwick has been built almost
entirely underground, below the 18th green of the Glen golf course.

AMID angry scenes, Strathclyde councillor Tommy Sheridan was carried
out of a water authority meeting by police yesterday.
Mr Sheridan and about 20 other campaigners were forcibly ejected after
they disrupted the public session of the West of Scotland Water
Authority in Dumfries.
They were protesting over what they described as the ''step by step
privatisation'' of Scottish water by an ''illegitimate, unaccountable
and unelected'' body.
Afterwards, Mr Sheridan, who led the Hands Off Our Water protest,
called for the resignation of chairman John Jameson and added: ''This is
just the start of our protest. We are not going to stand back and watch
the theft of Scotland's water.
''Our protest will be even stronger than the campaign against the poll
tax.''
He added: ''We will be holding further demonstrations like this. I
hope the police will not be used to assist in the theft of Scottish
water. They should be ashamed of themselves.''
Mr Sheridan and the other protesters, mainly from the Glasgow area,
had been allowed to ask questions for 15 minutes at the start of the
public session in the regional council chamber.
But when Mr Jameson told them their time was up, Mr Sheridan stepped
into the well of the chamber followed by the others.
He told the members: ''We are not going to sit here and listen to
this. We are going to carry on our discussions here.''
The meeting came to a halt as the campaigners continued to protest and
handed out leaflets to members.
Five policemen who had been posted outside the building entered the
chamber. A sergeant asked the protesters to leave.
Most of them then sat down on the floor and officers started lifting
the protesters and carrying them out of the building. There were no
arrests.
Dumfries and Galloway councillor Bill Nimmo, who sat with the
protesters, said he deplored the fact that the meeting had not been
advertised locally.

CHANCELLOR Kenneth Clarke said last night that Britain was on course
to meet the criteria necessary to join a single European currency.
He said that if a ''hard core'' of the economically strongest EU
nations went ahead with a single currency, Britain would have to decide
whether it was in its national interest to join.
Mr Clarke, in Valencia for a meeting of EU finance ministers, said the
French -- strong supporters of a single currency -- were among those
countries having difficulty in fulfilling the convergence criteria set
out in the Maastricht Treaty.
He said on Channel 4 News: ''The key thing is that those European
countries should all make the effort to get their public finances and
their inflation levels into a healthy state.
''We, the British, are doing that. The French are having terrible
trouble, so are the Italians. Maastricht always contemplated only the
strongest economies would be eligible for economic and monetary union in
the first place.''
Mr Clarke said that if the strongest countries did decide to join,
then Britain would have to consider whether it was in its economic
interests to participate.
He also suggested he would be happy for a single currency to be called
the florin, declaring: ''I think it is quite an attractive name.''
However, right-wing Tory MP for Southend East, Sir Teddy Taylor,
yesterday urged the Government to call the new Euro currency the
''Eurocon''.
In a constituency speech, he said: ''Britain has been rightly attacked
for not playing a positive enough role in Europe, and it is distressing
that our nation is not putting forward its clear suggestion on a name
for the proposed EU currency.
''The Chancellor has said that he might or might not favour the name
'florin', but even if he did it would clearly be an inadequate name
because it would simply remind the people of Britain of the inflationary
consequences of decimalisation.
''The most appropriate name which the Government should champion, is
the 'con or Eurocon'.''
Meanwhile, Germany's finance minister, Mr Theo Waigel, said he feared
not enough member states -- the so-called ''critical mass'' -- would be
economically ready, willing, and able to join the single currency on
time.
One European official said yesterday: ''Without a critical mass we are
in a critical mess.''
Euro-fanatics are publicly expressing what have until now been private
fears that most European economies are not performing well enough to
meet the convergence targets for a smooth transition.
The gloom facing finance ministers was deepened by Prime Minister John
Major's blunt talking at last weekend's Majorca summit when he pointed
out that a two-speed Europe -- with some inside and some outside a
single curency -- would be difficult, if not impossible, to manage.
On Thursday, and in line with market expectations, no new initiative
on interest rates was immediately forthcoming at the regular monthly
monetary meeting between the Chancellor and Governor of the Bank of
England, Mr Eddie George.
The October Monthly Monetary Report from the Treasury, meanwhile, said
that while the growth of the economy has clearly slowed during the year
to June 1995, with GDP up 2.8% after revised growth of 0.5% in the
second quarter, the latest monthly indicators suggest that it still
continues at a sustainable rate.

SCOTTISHPOWER tightened its grip on Manweb yesterday after the English
regional electricity company said its talks with a rival suitor had
collapsed.
Manweb shares tumbled 16p to 998p and ScottishPower bought a further
2.1% slice of the company on the open market, boosting its overall stake
to 19.4%.
A further takeover saga opened up in the electricity industry
yesterday as the English power company Southern revealed that it was in
talks with an unnamed third party which might lead to an agreed bid.
This would probably be worth around #2700m.
Mr Ian Graham, electricity analyst at NatWest Securities, said he
expected a deal to be tied up quickly.
Mr Graham said: ''They have got a chance to talk over the weekend. I
would be surprised if it wasn't out by Monday or Tuesday.''
Speculation over the identity of the mystery bidder ranged from
National Power to British Gas or a French or US utility.
ScottishPower's own #1100m hostile bid for Manweb received a boost
when the Chester-based company announced the collapse of 10 days of
talks with a potential rival, PacifiCorp of the United States.
''We are confident. It is a step forward for us,'' said
ScottishPower's chief executive, Mr Ian Robinson.
Mr Graham, commenting on the ScottishPower bid added: ''I think it is
unlikely that anyone else will enter the fray now and we are certainly
recommending that shareholders should accept ScottishPower's cash and
paper offer.''
Manweb's chief executive Mr John Roberts said the unnamed ''white
knight'' had been discussing an agreed cash offer in the region of 1050p
to 1100p per share.
This topped ScottishPower's cash-plus-shares bid, currently worth
1004p, with an all-cash alternative of 990p.
Mr Roberts added: ''I think the reason that the talks collapsed was
basically the situation that was taking place in Norweb.''
Manweb shareholders have until 1pm next Friday to accept the
ScottishPower bid.
Mr Roberts said he would continue trying to persuade institutional
investors that Manweb's conditional promise of a 550p benefits package
for shareholders was more attractive.

Time delay in Labour bomb hoax mystery
THE investigation into the bomb hoax at Labour's headquarters in
Glasgow last weekend took a new twist last night when the party's top
official in Scotland admitted that he found the suspicious package
almost four hours before he called in the police.
Scottish general secretary Jack McConnell said he left the package in
the building while he attended a party seminar in the city centre, only
reporting it to the police once he returned to Keir Hardie House in the
afternoon.
Mr McConnell has spent the week defending his version of events last
Saturday, in particular the way in which the media arrived so quickly on
the scene.
In The Herald yesterday, he wrote: ''Immediately I arrived at our
office on Saturday afternoon -- approximately 1.30pm -- I discovered in
our mail the suspect package and telephoned Strathclyde Police.''
This brought a surprised reaction from some who had attended a seminar
at Glasgow's Central Hotel last Saturday morning organised by Labour
think-tank the John Wheatley Centre.
Mr McConnell had arrived at around 10.30am and remarked during his
speech: ''I am sorry I was late this morning but there was another
suspect package in the office -- surprise, surprise! -- after this
week's publicity.''
The publicity referred to involved the leak of an internal memo from
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson urging Labour MPs to exploit
the ''darker side of nationalism'' represented by terrorist threats.
This coincided with the opening day of the SNP conference in Perth.
Saturday's bomb hoax coincided with the final day of the Perth
conference and was referred to in a letter to The Herald on Monday as an
example of the kind of behaviour which can be incited by the use of
inflammatory and emotional language by SNP activists.
Last night, Mr McConnell admitted that he had actually discovered the
suspect package -- a padded envelope containing pieces of metal,
cuttings from SNP pamphlets, and a death threat directed at Mr Robertson
-- at 9.45am when he looked into his office to pick up a copy of his
speech on the way to the seminar.
''I looked into the office, lifted the mail from behind the door, and
spotted the Jiffy Bag,'' he said. ''I put it to one side and then went
back to it after attending the conference.''
Was that not an extraordinary act -- to leave behind in the empty
building something that might have been a bomb because a seminar
attended by fewer than 30 people was more important?
''It wasn't me who treated it all that seriously,'' he said. ''It was
the police who called in the bomb squad. It was something that was
designed to scare.''
Mr McConnell said he had given the police the full chronology of
Saturday's events and he did not regard leaving the package behind as
particularly risky as letter bombs are primed specificially to ignite on
opening.
Among those surprised by the suggestion that the package was
discovered at 1.30pm was Fraser of Allander economist Jim Stevens, a
member of Labour's Scottish executive who shared the platform with Mr
McConnell on Saturday morning and remembered the reference to the
suspect package because he made a joking comment when it was said.
Others on the platform were Labour MP John McAllion and Strathclyde
University politics lecturer James Mitchell, who said: ''When I read the
letter in this morning's Herald, I found it very strange. As for the
idea that someone would leave what they thought might be a bomb and go
off to such an event is quite extraordinary.''
SNP chief executive Michael Russell said: ''This matter is a major
political scandal for the Labour Party. Scotland needs to know what
really happened last Saturday.''
However, Mr Robertson came to the defence of his senior official,
saying that he had noticed the package only while rushing through the
office on his way to the seminar and the significance of it had fully
dawned in the course of the morning.
''You have to remember there is a vast amount of mail,'' said Mr
Robertson. ''It was something going round in his mind and I think it
suddenly struck him how suspicious it looked.''
On what looked like a serious breach of security in leaving the
package in the office, Mr Robertson said: ''I have had under-car mirrors
since the Gibraltar shooting that I am meant to use every morning but
you don't always do these things.''

IRA rejects 'ludicrous' arms demand.
Dublin
THE Northern Ireland peace process was on a knife-edge last night as
tensions grew between the British Government and Sinn Fein and the IRA
dismissed demands for a handover of arms as ludicrous.
In a strongly worded statement issued in Dublin, the IRA insisted
there was no possibility of disarmament except as part of a negotiated
political settlement.
This stark and contemptuous statement from the IRA Army Council is
designed to bolster the uncompromising position of Sinn Fein president
Gerry Adams in advance of a special delegates' conference of republican
activists in Dublin today .
For his part, Mr Adams claimed elements in the British authorities
were contemplating a breakdown of moves towards peace, followed by a
military crackdown.
However, Prime Minister John Major firmly dismissed the claims and
said that anyone who threatened the ceasefire after a year would have to
face not only the judgment of the Irish people but the judgment of
history.
Mr Adams's comments came in Dublin ahead of a meeting of the Irish
Government's National Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, attended by
Irish Prime Minister John Bruton.
The Sinn Fein president declared: ''Elements of the British
establishment and the British Government are contemplating the breakdown
of this peace process and also a sharp and unprecedented military
crackdown on republican activists.''
He said he based the claim on recent remarks by former Northern
Ireland Minister Michael Mates, as well as a ''continued state of
preparedness'' by the British forces in Ulster and the Government's
refusal to consider a debate on policing of the province.
He added it was his view that a way could be found out of the peace
process impasse -- centring on the issue of decommissioning of IRA arms
-- if ''saner'' British voices were allowed to speak.
''There are those in Britain who would like to see a settlement, even
a very radical one,'' Mr Adams said: ''But the policy of John Major and
Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew is one of brinkmanship.
There is always a danger when you bring things to the edge that they
will topple over.''
Mr Major, speaking in his Huntingdon constituency, made clear his
total opposition to any return to violence by the terrorists and gave a
clear warning: ''Anybody who seeks to damage the peace process, anybody
who seeks to end the ceasefire that has existed, will have to answer to
two very severe audiences.
''Firstly the audience of Irish men and women north and south of the
border. They don't want this to end, they want it to carry on and they
believe everyone has an obligation to make it carry on. Secondly, I
think they will have to answer to the audience of history.''
The IRA statement also casts doubts on an optimistic forecast made
earlier yesterday by Mr Bruton, that movement in the peace process was
''tantalisingly close'' to a breakthrough.
Speaking to journalists after a two-hour private meeting with Mr
Adams, Mr Bruton said he was now more confident that they were broadly
on course to breaking the impasse over the decommissioning of
paramilitary arms and explosives.
However, Mr Bruton remained wary about setting time limits. It was
this unresolved issue which forced Mr Bruton to postpone a summit
meeting at Chequers with Mr Major.
The possibility of the rescheduling of this summit next month was
signalled by Mr Bruton when he said that a formula might be found to
satisfy the conflicting demands of the British Government, Sinn Fein,
and the Ulster Unionists on the arms question.
Leading Sinn Fein activist Martin McGuinness indicated that
discussions were under way which might find a way round the impasse. He
said: ''We have to wait and see the outcome of the discussions which are
presently under way.
''I would not go as far as to say it is tantalisingly close but I
certainly think there is widespread recognition among everybody who is a
party to this process that we have to find a way around the impasse.''
Mr Bruton will have his first meeting with the new leader of the
Ulster Unionist Party, Mr David Trimble, in Dublin on Monday, at which
they will assess the prospects for convening round-table talks with all
the political parties in Northern Ireland before the end of the year.
The bluntness of the IRA statement was being interpreted in Government
circles in Dublin last night as a warning that the conditions for
political progress had been lost sight of as far as the IRA leadership
is concerned.
* The Grand Orange Lodge in Scotlandlast night expressed its anger at
a visit by Mr Adams to Scotland on Sunday, when he is due to address a
meeting in Glasgow.
Claiming the visit would prompt a great deal of ill-feeling in
Scotland, the grand secretary of the Grand Orange Lodge of Scotland, Mr
Jack Ramsay, said members of his organisation intended to stage a
peaceful protest.

It hurts me very much to face losing my husband in a manner which has
become outside my control.
Carling's wife tells of despair
JULIA Carling yesterday voiced her despair at the break-up of her
marriage after weeks of speculation about her husband's friendship with
the Princess of Wales.
''I had always valued my marriage as the most important and sacred
part of my life and it hurts me very much to face losing my husband in a
manner which has become outside my control.
''I have given total support to Will and this has unfortunately proved
to no avail,'' said Mrs Carling, 30, a television presenter and model.
She broke her silence in a statement to the Press Association hours
after England rugby captain Will Carling, 29, announced that they were
separating after 15 months of marriage.
However, the Princess of Wales last night branded Carling ''a fool''
for splitting with his wife. She was adamant that she was not to blame
for the much publicised problems of the marriage.
The princess was quoted as telling close friends: ''This is not down
to me. It is a matter for the Carlings. It is not my fault. He's made a
fool of himself. He has behaved like a fool.''
Mr Colin Herridge, the friend who Carling stayed with after moving out
of his #250,000 south London home on Thursday, said he believed the
couple were still talking and that the rugby player was hopeful they
could sort out their problems.
''I don't think he feels the world's ended, because I think he's very
positive about the future outcome,'' he said.
''There's a huge amount of media pressure which has been on both of
them. Obviously she felt it as much, if not more.
''I think both of them in many ways have coped with it very well. I
don't think either of them have anything to reproach themselves with.''
Carling's statement, issued through Mr Herridge, the Rugby Union media
officer, said he and his wife wanted ''to emphasise that nobody else is
involved and they hope that by allowing themselves time to reflect, they
will be able to get back together as soon as possible''.
Mrs Carling appeared anxious as she arrived in her BMW for the weekend
at her parents' Georgian house in Aldwincle, Northamptonshire.
Her father, Mr Brian Smith, said: ''She has come home to be with her
family. She will not be speaking to any newspaper and does not wish to
make any comment.''
Her husband had arrived late on Thursday at Mr Herridge's home in
Esher, Surrey.
Mr Herridge said the England captain had spent the day dealing with
business matters and had an evening speaking engagement.
He expected Carling to have a quiet morning in advance of his
Harlequins league match against West Hartlepool today, and said the star
was ''welcome'' to stay at his home if he wished.
The Princess of Wales, meanwhile, went to her regular gym session at
Chelsea Harbour Club, west London.
The Carlings' split follows weeks of speculation about their marriage
sparked by his former personal assistant Hilary Ryan's claims that he
had enjoyed ''secret trysts'' with the Princess of Wales.
Carling announced that he would not be seeing the princess again, and
Mrs Carling warned that the princess would have a fight on her hands.
Carling denied he had met the princess last Friday at the West London
gym.
Mr Alan Watson, Carling's physiotherapist for five years, said: ''He
came in for treatment at quarter to nine, late. He came straight
upstairs to see me in a mad dash. He didn't go through the gym.''
Brian Moore, a club and England colleague of Carling's, whose own
marriage broke down earlier this year, said: ''It's a very sad
situation, but it is something that they need to work out for themselves
and they need the space to do it.''
A close friend of the England captain said: ''There is no doubt that
women find him very attractive. He has enormous charisma and girls are
attracted to him. They fawn in his company.
''By the same token he has clearly become overwhelmed by the Princess
of Wales.
''In many respects the life of an international touring rugby player
is that of the public school. It's a gang of blokes travelling the world
together and rooming with one another in a sort of male bonding
atmosphere.
''In some ways he is still a schoolboy.
Carling has pulled out of BBC1's sports quiz, They Think It's All
Over, which he was due to record on Monday.
