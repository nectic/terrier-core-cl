DUMBARTON is a place you won't easily miss, with its massive 250-ft
high castle rock. Standing on the verge of Loch Lomond, it has become an
important tourist centre, and has done a lot to lift its image in recent
years,with the cleaning up of the banks of the River Leven and clearing
away of rotting hulks which lay in the river for many years.
Almost in the centre of Dumbarton is Levengrove Park, once the home of
the famous printing family of Dicksons. It is well worth a visit today
with its lovely setting, for it has high quality bedding.
When I visited the park recently, I was met by contracts manager for
the District Council, Drew Thornton and charge hand gardener, Bobby
McLeish.
Plants for Levengrove, Helensburgh, Alexandria and Luss, are all
raised in the central nursery at Levengrove, and new glasshouses are
shortly to be built to improve production capacities.
Asked what he thought of contracting out -- when local authorities
must ask for tenders from private commercial firms to provide plants and
services -- Drew was happy to tell me they had won the contract for a
further five years.
In his view it had done a lot to improve the quality of local
authority bedding displays up and down the country.
Meanwhile, the domestic gardener has to recognise that August to
September can be treacherous for disease. Warm in the day, with heavy
dew and high humidity at night means rapid development of grey mould or
botrytis.
Tomatoes can be infected and drop off. Side shoots can die back, and
the whole plant is doomed when the disease has ringed the main stem.
Strip off as much foliage as reasonable, and let air in and around the
base. Keep ventilation on night and day. If things get really bad, spray
with a general fungicide.
Pot plants can also be attacked also. It may be advisable to bring
them into the home rather than leave them at risk.
Lawns should make some slow recovery after the severe burning they
have had. Don't be tempted to do anything drastic like putting on
fertiliser, until there is some sign of good regrowth.
Outside containers, including hanging baskets, will tend to lose a lot
of their vigour in the next few weeks. You must decide what their future
is.
There may be lots of plants you wish to save. To keep them in the
greenhouse over winter, frost protection will be necessary.
Alternatively, bring cuttings into the home for rooting and growing on
in small pots.
Time also to prune vigorous shrubs, without worrying too much about
old or new wood. Cut them into shape, particularly when they overhang
paths or lawns. But don't prune gooseberries yet. They are better left
until February or March.
It has been a busy time in the vegetable garden also, and it still
takes a lot to beat fresh produce from your own garden.
But let's face it, growing vegetables can be hard work. You have
problems of clubroot, slugs, root fly, caterpillars and so on, not
forgetting weeds.
This is an ideal time to review production plans for next year. Every
so often, I have a sabbatical year. Except for a few salads, I rest
ground. Not fallow, of course. Put the ground to a green manuring crop
like rape, vetches or Italian rye grass, to put goodness back into it.
Gardeners often ask about bare fallowing ground, leaving it completely
bare of crops for a season. It means hoeing off weeds as they appear or
using a contact weed killer.
The trouble is that, while it reduces the weeds, you do not improve
the physical nature of the soil.

Louis Armstrong's 50 Hot Choruses for Cornet (Volumes 3-4), Bent
Persson (Kenneth)
* A STORY goes with this one: in 1927 Louis Armstrong recorded a
collection of choruses which were then transcribed and published as
sheet music. The cylinders on which the solos were recorded are long
lost and he never incorporated them into his own recordings; indeed he
never recorded most of the tunes for which they were intended. In the
1970s, ace Swedish cornettist Bent Persson, recently heard at the
Edinburgh International Jazz Festival, started a project to put the
solos into their intended contexts -- the full tunes and varying sizes
of bands. These latest 18 tracks form the final volume of a superb
collection, on which Persson and British pianist Keith Nicholls excel.
Especially on a selection of Jelly Roll Morton numbers.

For the Record, JSD Band (Village Music)
* AFTER a 20-year sabbatical Scotland's prototype folk rockers return
with 14 re-recorded favourites from their stomping heyday, their Celtic,
Bluegrass and Cajun mix sounding slightly more grizzled but less
frenzied. Chuck Fleming's expressive fiddling makes a particularly
welcome return, although it will be interesting to see if, now the
sleeping dogs are awake, what new tricks they can learn.
Fine Flowers &amp; Foolish Glances, Mick West (Lochshore)
* A HIGHLY creditable debut from Glasgow-born singer and bodhran
player West, whose calm, assured and natural singing of mostly
traditional songs is supported by imaginative arrangements and some
excellent playing, particularly from guitarist Tony McManus and pianist
Brian Byrne on Chester City's syncopated swagger.

IN EUROPE
BORUSSIA Dortmund, in Rangers' section in the Champions' League,
appear to have overcome a recent sticky patch with a victory last night
in a first division match.
Borussia Moenchengladbach had taken the lead after 19 minutes through
Dahlin, but the German champions scored twice in the second half, the
goals coming from Reuter, with a penalty in 54 minutes, and Ricken, who
struck with 10 minutes remaining, sending the home fans in the crowd of
42,000 home happy.
One set of fans certainly not too impressed by their side were the
followers of Nantes, the French champions going down 3-0 at Bordeaux.

THE headmaster who resigned from leading public school Charterhouse
was astonished when a teenage prostitute he went to meet recognised him,
according to a report last night.
Mr Peter Hobson looked ''very scruffy'' when he arrived at a flat used
by 19-year-old Sally Henderson, but she knew straight away who he was
and was a public school girl herself, she told a newspaper.
In another interview, she said the moment the 50-year-old married man
arrived for their encounter, ''he paid me #120 in cash and got straight
down to business''.
Ms Henderson told the paper she left Tormead School for Girls in
Guildford, Surrey, in June.
She fell out with her parents and joined a Guildford-based escort
agency called Sophisticats.
She was astonished to recognise her client when Mr Hobson appeared,
she said.
''I told him he had once given a speech at my school. He didn't
realise I'd been to public school.
''He seemed very embarrassed. I imagine he was very taken aback
because I knew exactly who he was from the start.''
She claimed: ''When he came to me, he was very scruffy, and hungry for
sex . . . he stayed for over an hour, then he went.''
Ms Henderson alleged she later telephoned him at Charterhouse to give
him her latest address, but he told her not to contact her there and
they never met again.
She said Mr Hobson, who was in hiding yesterday, had asked the agency
for a youngster.
''I was wearing a tight mini-skirt and low-cut red top that showed off
my cleavage. He asked me to take them off.
''We had a bit of a chat, then he stood up, took off his clothes and
lunged at me.''
According to one tabloid newspaper, Ms Henderson is the daughter of a
financial consultant, left school with 10 O-levels and three A-levels.
Mr Hobson, head at #12,000-a-year Charterhouse for two years, resigned
this week for ''health and personal reasons'', according to the
governors.

Eileen Crone discovers the feel-good factor in that sinking feeling
* YOU need to be blessed with exceptional luck these days to find an
original farmyard trough that hasn't already been put to good use in
someone's garden, and the quarried Portland stone sinks, made more than
a century ago, are also hard to come by and expensive if you do come
across one.
However, all is not lost. Reconstituted stone troughs can be bought at
garden centres; you may be lucky enough to have an old glazed white sink
which you can disguise by ''ageing'', and you can make your own trough.
One of the advantages of trough gardening is that you can create a
playground for fussy plants such as the acid-loving heathers by filling
with ericaceous compost and 50/50 lime-free gravel and sand. When
raised, they are also ideal for the disabled gardener, and are easy to
water and protect from the wind by covering.
Maintenance is minimal, with an annual scattering of hoof and horn or
bonemeal (but not together), or replacing the top few inches of soil
each growing season. Troughs also respond to the occasional very weak
liquid feed.
Spraying dwarf conifers in early Spring or early Autumn with a
systemic insecticide will prevent the browning often caused by insect
damage.
The Royal Botanical Garden in Edinburgh is a source of inspiration,
with a great display of troughs surrounding the Alpine House. Pride of
place is given to an enormous trough which came from House O'Hill Farm
and is about 12ft x 6ft.
Alan Docherty, buyer at Findlay Clark in Bearsden, says: ''The slower
growing smaller Alpines such as cushion-forming saxifrages are ideal;
not aubretia or alyssum as these would smother the trough in one
season.''
Alpine plants are shallow-rooted and tend to like well-drained soil.
Alison Campbell at Dougal Philips Walled Garden Centre in Edinburgh,
says: ''We have a vast array of Alpines, with thymes and the interesting
fuchias selling particularly well.''
To make a trough from an old sink, you first need to cut away any
plumbing remains from the underside. Then thoroughly scrub the sink and
let it dry. Apply a strong bonding adhesive and then apply your stone
mixture, which consists of equal parts silver sand, cement and sieved
sphagnum peat mixed with water to the consistency of thick porridge. At
the top of the sink you must treat the inside as well as the outside.
Cover the sink with a tarpaulin, or damp sack or cloth, so that it will
dry slowly.
You can distress the sink by brushing with an old paintbrush or wire
brush before it dries. A coating on the outside of liquid fertiliser or
live yoghurt will encourage the growth of mosses.
Then all you need to do is ensure there are sufficient drainage holes
and crocks, and fill the trough with an appropriate mix of loam to grit,
such as John Innes Number Two. Try to raise the trough off the ground on
bricks or a plinth -- being careful not to block the drainage holes --
and put it in your preferred location before filling as it will be
extremely heavy when full. Make sure the trough is level as drainage
problems are often caused by uneven sites.
The top may be dressed with broken flints (especially good if you are
planting silver foliage) or gravel. A few strategically placed rocks
will provide a good background for your choice of plants, but be careful
with limestone unless your planting choice will tolerate lime soil.
Plant suggestions:
* Primula -- can tolerate full sunlight.
* Gentian -- (6ins-12ins) electric blue flowers which need
water-retentive soil.
* Houseleek -- closely related to sedums. Spikes of red or pink
flowers in mid-summer.
* Saxifrage -- best known is London Pride (10ins) with tiny pink
flowers on tall slender stems.
* Campanola -- Arvatica (2ins) has blue flowers in summer.
* Dwarf conifers -- add body to the display with 0.5cm growth a year.
* Alpine pinks.
* Miniature violas, roses and daffodils -- for changing displays.
Findlay Clark Garden Centres offer a rockery planter in reconstituted
stone at #42.55 plus an extensive range of plants at #1.49.
Dougal Philips Walled Garden Centre, Edinburgh, has troughs from #16
to #40 unplanted, and planted troughs from #40 to #120 (2ft x 1ft).
Alpine plants are #1.30, or #6.50 for six. They also stock suitable
composts and individual rocks in tufa, granite and volcanic lava.

* BEFORE taking part in Radio Scotland's Beechgrove Potting Shed show
recently, Frieda Morrison, who presents this and the excellent Out of
Doors programme, and I were chatting about the philosophy of gardens and
speculating what might be a suitable motto for me.
Wracking my brains to come up with something deep and meaningful, out
popped the unexpected words: ''It beats housework!''
A few weeks later I heard the same opinion being expressed by another
female guest and it made me realise that there must be a monstrous
regiment of plantswomen out there who would rather mow an acre than
hoover the rug, turn over the compost heap in preference to tackling an
offspring's bedroom and when faced with a choice of dusting and
polishing or restoring a castor oil plant, would plump for good old
Ricinus any time.
Perhaps even a few of us secretly yearn for the days of yore when
household cleaning materials were gleaned from garden, hedgerow and
wood. Just think -- no overcrowded supermarkets, price comparisons,
endless check-out queues and certainly no faulty spray nozzles and
opening-proof packaging.
In castle and in cottage, the first floor fresheners were rushes,
straw and dried hay, forerunners of the strewing herbs which contained
not only scenting properties but were also antiseptic and disinfectant.
The herbs used were rosemary, sage, thyme, hyssop, lavender, costmary,
juniper and artemisia.
Some, such as the artemisia wormwood and southernwood (the latter
popularly known in some areas of Scotland as apple ringie) possessed
insect-repelling constituents, and were often laid among linen and in
the pages of books to repel moths and bookworms. Your own carpet
freshener can be made by processing used potpourri ingredients with two
or three drops of essential oils.
The Nineties saw the introduction of domestic water purification units
for water supplies but centuries before, pennyroyal was added to ships'
barrels of water on long sea voyages to keep it fresh. Along with rue
and tansy, this herb was utilised as an ant repellent while the
equivalent of the fly spray came in the shape of basil, tansy, mints and
camomile.
Are your problem visitors small, furry and four-legged? Aniseed
provides an irresistible bait for mousetraps.
Got the wash-day blues?
It's unfortunate that the volume of the average family's weekly wash
wouldn't merit making your own detergent from saponaria, or soapwort,
although firms specialising in the cleaning of delicate antique fabrics
often have this made up to their own individual specifications. However,
if you have any of the following growing in your garden, a scented rinse
for the final wash cycle can be made by boiling one ounce of herb(s) to
a pint of water, simmering for half an hour then straining. If
preferred, a drop or two of essential oil may be added, and the liquid
stored up to three days in the refrigerator. Sprayed on clothes while
ironing, it won't make this ghastly chore go by faster, but will
certainly make it more pleasurable.
Housework -- who needs it? Probably most of us, actually. But it can
be made less of a chore if you can produce the ingredients for all your
preparations from your garden, and you can also rest assured that
nothing you are using is likely to affect the atmosphere of the planet.

HEATHER ROSE finds that bidets are becoming bywords for better homes
* MENTION the word bidet in Scotland and you can guarantee titters --
if not howls -- of laughter. An odd reaction perhaps but, it seems, no
part of the home causes so much merriment as this item of bathroom
sanitaryware.
Of course, this strange behavioural trait does not occur too
frequently in Scotland for the simple reason that not too many of our
bathrooms sport this salubrious product.
However, this may now be about to change. There are signs the bidet is
set to become a more frequent feature of our homes, especially in the
realms of luxury properties.
A standard bathroom fitting in France since the early 19th century --
although the bidet has been in existence since 1710 -- our Gallic
cousins regard life without a bidet as most unhygienic.
Although bodies like the British Bathroom Council do not have any
checklist to prove an increase in the sale of bidets, a number of
plumbers say they are being asked to install them when fitting new
suites in homes in the process of being revamped.
In the world of housebuilding the bidet is being included more often
these days as a standard item of either main bathrooms or en-suite
bathrooms at new estates in the luxury market sector, as a tour of
showhomes will prove.
This links in with the fact that the bathroom is generally the
smallest room in the house, so naturally, it tends to be only the larger
homes which have bigger bathrooms spacious enough to house this
additional commodity.
It is, though, more than hygiene which has given rise to this trend.
Despite being the butt of so many jokes, it is a fact that the bidet can
have a serious side when it comes to house sales.
Mentioning in sale particulars that at least one bathroom has a 4 or
5-piece suite, including a bidet, can add to the propery's market value
and therefore help bring out those all-important buyers.
Yet the peculiar thing about the bidet being a bedmate for luxury is
the fact that it continues to carry a misunderstood air. In fact the
French, say the British Bathroom Council, joke about Brits being so
ignorant about the role of the bidet we have even been known to wash our
feet in them.
However, as John Pennell, director of the British Bathroom Council,
says: ''What's wrong with that? Nothing at all. Very refreshing it is
after a hard day trudging round the shops or dashing from the office.''
True, the main purpose of a bidet is to wash the lower parts of the
body. But, as Mr Pennell says, there is nothing wrong in using a bidet
for all sorts of other roles.
''Most of us leading an active life tend to get a bit sweaty around
the nether regions and there's nothing better than being able to freshen
up quickly and conveniently with a cooling splash in a bidet,'' says Mr
Pennell.
''Actually the bidet can be used for all sorts of washing activities
-- not only for our various bodily parts but for soaking socks, nappies
and smalls.''
Nor, as the council has discovered, is a bidet an asset only for young
families or active sporty types. It can be a boon for the elderly or
disabled who find getting in and out of a bath a troublesome exercise.
It seems they are even used for more unusual functions. The council
say this bathroom addition makes an ideal cooler for champagne and they
have been been known as the perfect place to defrost a turkey --
although not, of course, when being used for washing feet or smalls.
Should there be a call for water conservation this summer then the
bidet, like the shower, could gain an even higher profile.
It terms of water saving it can serve as an energy-saver, too.
All this versatility is, no doubt, helping give a more serious view to
this comical commodity in this country.
But advances in their design are also playing a part. In fact, they
take up little space, about 1300 by 800mm of floor area plus adequate
leg room which means it is possible to incorporate a bidet in fairly
small bathrooms.
Nor is their location limited purely to bathrooms. According to the
BBC, it is not uncommon to have bidets installed in the corner of a
bedroom.
There is, though, another sign the bidet is becoming less of a
laughing matter on the Scottish homes scene. Perhaps the most positive
indication of the bidet's future growth is the fact many bathroom
manufacturers now include them in their standard bathroom ranges.

* WHAT'S in a name? All manner of pitfalls, it seems, especially if
you happen to be the man responsible for christening new roads and
developments, writes SUE TRANTER.
You might think that naming a new street in a city like Glasgow is a
haphazard affair that involves coming up with an appropriate flower or
tree and then informing the postal services. Not a bit of it.
Names must be decided according to a number of criteria and the final
suggestion has to go before a committee in the city's department of
building control.
Ian Taylor, its director, is ultimately responsible for observing all
kinds of niceties like ensuring that the name doesn't offend anyone.
''We wouldn't consider a Rangers road in the East end of the city or a
Celtic View in the West,'' he says, to use an obvious example.
Though he concedes there is already one such road in existence which
must have slipped through before his day.
Builders can choose any name they like for their developments, often
making them sound grander than they deserve. However, when it comes to
influencing the building committee, there are guidelines to be met and
there have been one or two unhappy developers in the past who would have
liked to see their pet names adopted for their new streets.
Repetition is the most important consideration, according to Ian.
''We try to avoid confusion so location is also taken into account. In
a small development we might repeat the initial name but change the last
part into a court and a close so that people know the road they are
looking for must be near.
''We try to re-use old names when an area is redeveloped and also
names with a historical attachment. We might look at available
information to keep a historical association with a district, even
though the farm or industry involved no longer exists.''
If none of this applies, then building officers try to use a name that
has a connection, perhaps taking lakes or flowers or hills as a theme
for an area. Recently there was a request to name a road after the
laurel bushes growing predominantly in it. However, there was another
Laurel Avenue nearby, so Bay Tree was thoughtfully substituted by the
department as being in the same family. Clearly a qualification in
horticulture is a useful extra for anyone considering a job in the
building department.
''We do debate suggestions with district or community councillors and
sometimes they come up with ideas,'' says Ian.
Proper names are rarely used, with certain exceptions such as Nelson
Mandela Place. But the circumstances would have to be pretty special.
One thing Ian does rule out is discussion with local residents -- it
would cause all kinds of disagreement, it seems, and a final conclusion
would then be hard to achieve unanimously.
The number of new names is suprisingly high, with at least one coming
before the building committee for approval each fortnight. When a new
development is being completed it could be four or five at a sitting.
After a decision is made, the result is made known to around 15
different authorities like the fire, post, water and electricity
services.
Numbers are less of a problem, for a simple formula exists in Glasgow
though few citizens may be aware of it. Ian Taylor explains how the
principle works and it depends on standing with your back to Glasgow
Cross, either in your imagination or reality.
The numbers then go away from you in ascending order with odd on the
left and evens on the right. Numbers for parallel streets are taken from
the nearest main road.
Simple. Well perhaps not totally since Ian reckons that try as they
might its impossible to please everyone.
''It's one of those jobs that you just can't win,'' he says. And he
adds with a note of caution, once the name has been approved then there
really isn't any process for changing it.
So if Acacia Avenue isn't to your taste, tough luck -- you will have
to live with it.

Not so long ago, the six-figure house or flat was the province of the
rich and famous. Today, however, a property in the region of #100,000 is
commonplace, certainly in the densely populated areas of the central
belt. Here, WENDY JACK looks at what such a sum will buy you in
different parts of Scotland
THE SUBURBS
* THE external appearance of this tastefully extended detached villa
with attached single garage -- located in a quiet cul-de-sac in the
desirable Glasgow suburb of Bearsden -- belies its generous
accommodation.
An entrance vestibule and hall lead to a lounge with living flame gas
fire, and the (refitted) kitchen is open to a large L-shaped living area
-- 19ft 6in by 18ft 8in. There is an adjacent utility room with matching
floor and wall-coverings to the living area, with a door to the rear
garden, and another leading to a shower room. Upstairs are three
bedrooms, two with fitted double wardrobes and one with an in-built
cupboard. A part-tiled bathroom completes the interior -- described by
selling agent Clyde Property as having ''an outstanding finish''.
Outdoors, in Brandon Drive, there's a tarmacadam drive, a front garden
with lawn and shrub beds; and to the rear is a lawn and paved patio.
Fixed price: #99,500.
THE CITY
* AT the eastern end of Edinburgh's Georgian New Town an unusual
cottage-style maindoor ground and lower flat is on the market at
Blenheim Place, minutes walk from the Playhouse Theatre and Princes
Street.
The sitting room, 18ft 8in by 13ft 10in with twin windows to the rear,
has views of Calton Hill and the Balmoral Hotel clock tower. A gas coal
fire is housed in an original fireplace, and the room has fine
cornicing.
The kitchen/dining room also looks to the rear and has a sanded and
varnished floor. There are two bedrooms at ground level, the main one
with an original fireplace and open hearth also has a half timber
panelled dado.
Downstairs is a study/dressing room with fitted wardrobe with double
louvred doors, while the bathroom is half-tiled and has a corner bath.
The property, entered through a vestibule and hall with attractive
cornicing, has gas central heating, and is offered by selling agent
Stewart Saunders at #98,500 (fixed price).
THE COUNTRY
* MOVE well away from the busy central belt, and what will your
#100,000 get you? Six or so miles from Inverness, across the Kessock
Bridge in a rural situation, lies a modern architect-designed

* I WANDERED lonely as a cloud that floats on high o'er . . . ROAAAAR.
We know that William Wordsworth was a countryman, who lived in bucolic
settings for most of his life. But that was a good few years ago. The
poet didn't have to contend with low-flying jet fighters, as their
pilots practise the trade of blasting noisily beneath imaginary radar
beams.
How would he have written his ode to Daffodils today?
I wandered lonely as a cloud that floats on high o'er . . . CHUCKITY
CHUCKITY CHUCKITY. That's a combine harvester mopping up the golden
barley just behind the Wordsworth cottage. This is very interesting to
watch, and it's also nice to know that the farmers are having a
brilliant grain harvest and are going to get rich. Richer, sorry. But
for Wordsworth -- basically a freelance writer with a name that any
other freelance would envy -- the activities of the farmers are just a
counterpoint to his own existence. Then we have:
I wandered lonely as a cloud that floats on high o'er . . . SUCKY
SUCKY SQUELCH. This is Wordsworth's next-door neighbours having their
septic tank emptied after three years. Quite apart from the sound, how
would the image affect the poet's muse today? The muse would probably
make an excuse, and leave.
So yes: this we do know. The dream of living in the country still
exerts a powerful draw over large numbers of townies and city-dwellers.
Quite apart from anything else, there's the attraction of the property
prices.
Draw a circle around any city, using a radius of about 40 miles.
Inside this circle, you have what you could call the ''commutable
belt'', from which it is feasible to live some sort of country lifestyle
without giving up the day-job, travelling daily (usually by car) into
the maelstrom. This is not really country living at all, but a half-way
house. Nevertheless, if you buy a property within the circle, moving
towards the edge, clearly you will start to get slightly more for your
money than you would in the city itself.
It is when you look outside of this circle that property prices begin
to move into what seems like a fantasy league. Five bedrooms, acres of
land, sometimes costing less than a city centre flat. It seems
irresistible: and yet . . . You are in the grip of market forces.
But what do you expect of country living, if that's what you want? As
William Wordsworth would find in contemporary times, it's noisier than
it used to be. Where I stay, in a beautiful, long strath of fertile land
between gentle hills -- which jet fighter pilots find irresistible,
incidentally -- the sense of peace is ephemeral. Here we live in a wide,
open factory. The land is tilled, sown, bears fruit and is harvested.
Then, before you know where you are, it's being tilled again and dunked
with chemicals for the year's second crop.
There seem to be few days when the road oustide your house doesn't
throb to the massive engines of modern farm machinery or doesn't pong
from the accidental droppings of cow-dung transporters. In the nearest
country twon, where you go to buy the traditional pound of mince -- and
find that the greengrocer sold his only avocado just before you arrived
-- you can still enjoy a traffic jam. But a country traffic jam is much
more exotic than a city one.
The roads are blocked by massive trailers hauling tonnes of tatties to
the city markets which don't deserve them, supermarket shoppers who
think that tubers grow in ready-washed three-pound lots in poly bags. Or
else the road is blocked by a unwieldy space vehicle, as high as a city
tenement for control. These things have arms, legs and spouts which are
folded away for the trip along public roads at 30mph, followed by the
inevitable crocodile of travelling salesmen in white Vauxhalls.
Yet when you see these mightly engines blocking the crossroads, you
have absolutely no idea what they are designed to do. The might well
sort tatties into sizes, put the colour into beetroot, or even shoot
rabbits. They are a complete mystery.
It's strange that you never see them working in the fields. They are
part of the abiding enigma of the countryside to people, who, like me,
have gone there from the city and will never, ever, return. For a start,
we'd find it difficult to adjust to the property prices.
Maybe that was part of the dream that brought us here in the first
place. The rest of the dream, though, needs a bit of adjustment. You
will escape the noise and traffic jams and nasty smells of the city: but
there are noises, jams and smells of another kind waiting for you. You
may wander lonely as a cloud, but that's the least of your problems.

Beverly Brown finds much to commend both city living and the rustic
charm of a house in the country.
Town house
* TOWN house or country house. Each offers a distinctive, predictable
lifestyle. Or does it? Take two traditional detached Scottish houses,
both well over 100 years old. Two houses with lovingly-tended gardens,
bearing trees heavily laden with fruit, vegetable plots and brightly
coloured shrubs in pots scattered around identical garden tables and
chairs. Two houses where the owners can cast a line and, if they're
lucky, enjoy fresh fish for dinner. And two houses that each have a
secret well hidden from the view of passers-by.
Ironically, a surprising number of similarities link these two homes,
yet they are situated hundreds of miles apart; one is in the heart of a
city while the other nestles amongst bracken and heather-covered hills
that could grace a Highland postcard.
MOIRA Logue has only to walk across the road to reach the shops.
Living in one of the oldest houses in Glasgow's Cathcart district means
that amenities are on her doorstep.
''I first saw the house in 1991 when we were looking to move back to
the south side of the city,'' she says.
Husband Frank works abroad most of the year and, with three daughters
ranging in ages from seven to 22, Moira was searching for a home and
location to suit everyone's needs. ''When I saw this house I almost
drove away immediately, it looked so dilapidated. But once inside, all I
could see was the house's amazing potential -- although I had great
difficulty convincing Frank, after I had bought it.''
This home is like the Tardis; sandwiched between the tenement
buildings it precedes, the detached cottage-style house looks small from
the front. Inside however, it's extremely spacious, with a lounge,
dining room, bedroom, toilet and huge kitchen with an adjacent utility
room downstairs. Upstairs are two bedrooms and a large bathroom which
was at one time also a bedroom. But this house too has a secret asset; a
magnificent garden which stretches down to the White Cart river. With
its own fishing rights -- and grayling and brown trout in the river --
this is a city angler's dream come true.
''It's an amazing house full of contradictions,'' says Moira. ''When
you go through the front door you are in the city. But go through the
back door and you could be in the middle of the country.'' The Logues'
have laid a mono-block patio/terrace at the back of this unique
property. Beneath it, the garden sprawls down to the low wall that
separates it from the river.
Moira is currently making the most of this year's plum and apple
harvest and she keeps binoculars handy in the kitchen to watch the
foxes, kingfishers, otters, wild mink, sqirrels and heron which frequent
the river banks.
''In terms of upkeep it's a bit like the Forth Rail bridge, just as we
finish one room, we have to start another. But it's a homely house and
because we have literally started from scratch inside, we've got exactly
what we wanted -- plus a spectacular garden.''
Country house
* ANGUSINA Lewis lives in a modernised croft house two miles south of
Morar, just off the A830 Fort William to Mallaig road. The house
belonged to her late father-in-law and like most old houses, it has been
extensively renovated over the years to adapt to the needs of a growing
family, although only two of Angusina's children still live at home.
It's a typical West Highland croft house full of nooks and crannies
and loads of character. Downstairs is a large lounge with a stone
chimney breast incorporating an open fire and staircase leading to the
two double bedrooms and bathroom on the upper floor. Angusina has
installed double-glazed patio doors in the big kitchen which gives
access to the front garden and there is also a slightly elevated dining
room adjacent to the rear of the kitchen, plus a very-large utility
room.
Adjacent to the main house is a summer house constructed by Angusina's
late husband Duncan. This has a lounge, two bedrooms, kitchenette and
toilet with shower. With the house is about 22 acres of land --
including this home's hidden asset; its own stretch of the famous White
Sands of Morar. This is the beach that Burt Lancaster walked in Local
Hero and where Fulton MacKay built his hut. It's also the beach where
Sean Connery chased the stag in Highlander and it has been used in
numerous television commercials.
This spectacular beach with breathtaking views out over the Sound of
Sleat to the islands of Skye, Rhum and Eigg, regularly generates income
and Angusina has become adept at haggling over beach rental with film
location scouts. ''With the fee I received for the last television
commercial I bought the hill at the back of the house,'' she laughs.
''It's our part of heaven. We can walk from the house down on to our own
beach and the boys can fish from the rocks. And it's not remote; there
are good schools and shops in Morar and Mallaig, and Fort William is
only 40 miles away,'' she says.
* Sadly, family commitments mean the Lewis's house and grounds (with
considerable development potential) are for sale at offers over
#147,000. Tel: Andrew Paul &amp; Co on 0141 221 5185 for details.

DESPITE public pressure on manufacturers, the number of animals used
in the testing of cosmetics is on the increase, a completely disgusting
fact in these enlightened times. In 1992, 2,164 animals were used, while
in 1993, the figure shot up to 3,741.
In general, the public are aware of the cruelty practised in labs.
Some might believe that breakthroughs in science and medicine depend on
testing on animals, others, that the same tests can be carried out in a
test tube with a genetic duplicate of human skin. But what this page is
concerned with, is the fact that animals are being sadistically and
gratuitously maltreated in the name of consumerism. Animals aren't dumb,
vanity is.
The term ''cruelty-free'' may mean that the end product itself has not
been tested on animals, but it doesn't mean that the suppliers of its
ingredients have observed the same rule. A product which claims to have
''natural'' ingredients infers that it is based on plant extracts, but
apparently animal extracts can be legally classed as ''natural'' too.
Most companies are striving to end animal testing, although the
increase in the number of animals used is due to the need to test new
formulas such as anti-pollution or anti-ageing creams. A good rule of
thumb is, the newer a product or miracle ingredient, the more chance
there is of it having been tested. Such products are icons of
desperation. The desperation of the women who buy them to stay young,
and the desperation of companies to create ''ground-breaking'' beauty
products to compete in a more demanding market.
Some companies use cut-off dates. This means they won't use an
ingredient introduced after that time as it is likely it will then have
been tested. Everybody knows that The Body Shop do not test on animals,
but how are the bigger companies doing?
* L'Oreal and Lancome haven't used animals in their finished products
since 1990. They have been trying to provide alternative testing
methods, and contribute to an international data bank to avoid the
unnecessary repetition of animal tests.
* Estee Lauder does not have animal testing conducted on its behalf,
and hasn't tested on animals since 1990. The majority of its skin
irritancy tests are carried out on human volunteers and in vitro tests.
* Revlon was the first beauty company to buckle under public pressure,
to establish an in-house cell biology laboratory to explore alternative
testing methods in 1975. It ceased all animal testing on products and
ingredients in 1989.
* Rimmel evaluates safety on human volunteers, sticking to ingredients
which are well established, since 1981. It also contributes to FRAME
(Fund for the Replacement of Animals in Medical Experiments), set up in
1969 to research alternative methods.
* Christian Dior stopped all animal testing in 1989 and contributes
funds for alternative testing in France and America.

not testing on animals, contact them at 16a Crane Grove, London, N7 8LD

* AFTER 13 years of clinical testing, a portable electronic device
that allows some paraplegics to stand and walk on their own has been
given the green light for use in America.
Invented by Professor Daniel Graupe at the University of Illinois in
Chicago, the Parastep System is built around a microcomputer that sends
electrical pulses to a patient's legs, causing the muscles to contract.
At about the size of a personal stereo, the microcomputer runs on eight
AA batteries and is worn around the waist.
Using a walker for balance, people paralysed from the waist down can
stand up from a sitting position and walk short distances. Some patients
have walked as far as a mile.
''It's not a cure,'' says Graupe, ''but it makes a huge difference in
the life of someone who was told they would never walk again. Now they
can stand up, reach into a cupboard, and talk to people at eye level.
There are obvious mental benefits, and there are physical benefits as
well,'' he said.
More than 300 patients with spinal-cord injuries have learned to walk
again with the Parastep in tests carried out at a Chicago hospital.
The Parastep is specifically designed for people who have sustained
spinal-cord injuries, most often the result of car accidents. They are
paralysed from the waist down but have good upper-body strength and
control.
Patients must go through 32 hours of physiotherapy to learn how to use
the system on their own. Four out of six patients being trained at
Michael Reese Hospital are victims of gunshot wounds.
When the spinal cord is severed, a connection is lost between the
brain and muscles in the legs. ''It's like a telephone with its cord
unplugged,'' says Graupe.
The Parastep microcomputer fills in that communication gap by
generating signals that simulate those that should have come through the
spinal cord from the brain. The signals, controlled by the user's
upper-body movements, fingertip controls on the walker, or voice
commands, are sent to electrodes attached to various points on the legs.
Having got governmental approval, the Parastep is being manufactured,
marketed, and distributed by Sigmedics, Inc, in Northfield, Illinois.
* ABERDEEN'S big festival of technology and science launches itself
next Saturday for a real nine-day wonder.
The festival is designed to encourage a closer look at and stimulate
interest in all things scientific, and the considerably packed programme
includes an inflatable planetarium with a projector that creates more
than 3000 stars and a Mad Lab where youngsters can learn how to make
electronic gadgets such as lie detectors and radios.
Mastermind presenter Magnus Magnusson will present the Creativity in
Science and technology Awards and during the week events for children
will include forensic and environmental workshops, Johnny Ball's All
Electric Roadshow featuring Faraday's electro-magnetism, and an
hour-long display by British Gas scientists and engineers offering more
than 50 demonstrations of flames.
* INTERNET: Beyond the hype. That's the title for the one-day business
workshop and Cybercafe event being run by EDINAS, the Edinburgh
Informatics Association which includes the Royal Bank of Scotland,
United Artists Communications, and the Scottish Enterprise Software
Team.
The first event, about the Internet, is scheduled for September 26,
and EDINAS has arranged a team of presenters to go ''beyond the hype''
to bring an independent and measured view of what the information
superhighway technology can achieve. It will view some of the hottest
sites and demonstrate how to access net-forums on the web. The workshop
will also be a class for learning essential short-cuts through
cyberspace and to discover on-line resources for business applications.
The course will be run in Edinburgh University's computer science
training suite in Appleton Tower, George Square.

* THE problem with new technology is simply that it's new. Some of us
would have loved that technology to have been around when we needed it
most, things like karaoke when we still had the nerve, computer games
for rainy nights, films on CD for baby-sitting with the girlfriend.
But mostly we would have killed for this wonderful new gadget that
could have changed some of our lives forever.
It's called the Fretlight, and it's something completely different in
the stratocasting world of electric guitars. It combines the best of
guitar craftsmanship with computer technology. The makers describe it as
a hands-on interactive guitar for the modern-day.
The Fretlight features a specially programmed on-board computer which
allows the player to select a scale or chord, or even an arpeggio, which
will instantly light up on the guitar fretboard. The correct notes of
almost 400 scales and chords are then lit up by 132 light-emitting
diodes inlaid on the neck.
The lights enable the would-be player to see chord connections across
the fingerboard and even the most inexperienced strummer can pick up
speed on the strings. As a tutorial instrument, it looks ideal.
Virtually any chord or scale can be selected and displayed, allowing
players to focus on timing, finger placement, and sound immediately
without having to flip over the pages of the trusty Bert Weedon
teach-yourself-guitar handbook.
The Fretlight range comes in acoustic, bass, and standard versions,
from #549-#599 from Fretlight Music Ltd in London. It should be a boon
to anyone who doesn't want to take four years to learn Michael Row the
Boat Ashore, who wants to play more chords than Status Quo, and who
hankers back to a youth that could have been more misspent than he
remembers. Like your Frontiersman.

Lesley Duncan marvels at the transformation of Stirling to accommodate
tourists without losing its regal grandeur
THE Great Hall at Stirling Castle will reverberate tomorrow night not
to the ghosts of the Stewart dynasty (as it was known until the time of
Mary Queen of Scots) but to a living legend of Hollywood. The vast
chamber where Scottish parliaments once met and kings feasted will be
the setting for a reception after the European premiere -- at the
MacRobert Centre -- of the film Braveheart. A cast of hundreds is
expected. Braveheart, made by and starring Mel Gibson, is of course
about Sir William Wallace.
Twentieth-Century Fox could not have chosen a more appropriate
location than Stirling Castle, though the monumental task of restoring
the Great Hall to its original state is far from complete. The
perpendicular windows with loops of ornamental stonework look out
towards the Ochils and the gothic spike of the Wallace Monument, erected
by public subscription last century in one of Scotland's periodic bouts
of patriotic fervour. (The slight Mr Gibson would be dwarfed by the
hero's 6ft sword on show there.)
The coils of the Forth can be seen, but the site of Wallace's victory
over the English at Stirling Bridge is obscured by Gowan Hill. This open
land to the east of the castle is marked by golden striations of whin in
spring. The hill is also the site of a beheading stone -- well-used. In
Stirling, the picturesque past tends to be entwined with violence.
Only the most partial of Edinburghers could claim that their castle
rivals Stirling's. Both sit on extinct volcanoes. But Stirling's is much
more impressive to look at -- and from. Its domination of the marshy
plain of the Forth and strategic siting on the verge of the Highlands
once gave it as central a role in Scottish history as they now do in
tourism. It would be the logical focal point of an independent Scotland.
The view from its ramparts on a summer's evening is memorable.
Immediately below the western escarpment of trees lie the outlines of
the seventeenth-century pleasure gardens called the King's Knot. Fields
of gathered hay and distant lines of trees fill the carse, to disappear
into a haze, broken finally by the silhouettes of Bens Lomond, Venue,
Ledi, and Vorlich, and Stuc a'Chroin. The towers of the new business
park are, happily, less obtrusive from above than from the M9.
This development is only the latest example of the chronic dilemma
facing such a place of layered history as Stirling -- how to reconcile
contemporary needs and economic activity with a heritage that is of
importance not just to the local community but to the nation.
Accommodations have, inevitably, tended to be uneasy.
The Raploch housing estate and the little businesses of the Back o'
Hill are not aesthetically appealing -- but people must live and work,
whatever grandees once got up to in the great stone edifice that
overshadows them.
Not that most of us Scots -- a sadly deracinated people these days --
know much about our past anyway. How many could say which Stewart king
was nicknamed the Guidman of Ballengeich, or indeed why? Fewer, no
doubt, than those who could recite the names of the six wives of James
V's contemporary, Henry VIII.
Thus locals, as well as the cosmopolitan mix of Midwest matrons,
students from the Continent, and Japanese who crowd the visitors' centre
by the castle esplanade, can learn from the playlet about the Stewart
dynasty performed there daily, or from the breezy historical insights
offered by castle guide John Ritchie.
He gathers his group on the ramparts above Queen Anne's Garden. This
is an unlikely haven of colour within the castle. A lawn of
bowling-green pretensions is rimmed by scarlet roses. Golden rod and
phlox add their glow to herbaceous borders. The twin beech trees, some
270 years old, dominate the summer, as they do the winter, scene.
Ritchie, glengarry on head, walking-stick at the ready, has humour as
well as facts to dispense. We learn how ''a gentleman -- I beg your
pardon, a man -- called Oliver Cromwell'' caused cannon-balls to be
lobbed from the Church of the Holy Rude nearby into the castle towers,
decapitating some of them. And how James V -- ''who had a sense of
humour, like all Scotsmen'' -- had a statue of the devil carved in the
form of a woman on his palace wall. ''Back me up lads,'' begs Ritchie,
''it might well have been his mother-in-law!''
His amused audience are more receptive to the straight history,
whether about Bonnie Prince Charlie's inept seige of the castle in 1746,
or the poisoning of James IV's mistress Margaret Drummond to allow the
fateful ''Marriage of the Thistle and the Rose''. As for the Guidman of
Ballengeich, James V may have issued from the castle incognito to meet
his subjects and hear their grievances; on the other hand, he may simply
have gone in pursuit of ''ale and ladies'' (he did, after all, father
some 30 illegitimate children in his 29 years).
Days could be spent exploring the castle. The Chapel Royal, on whose
site Robert Carver's wondrous masses once rang out, is closed for
renovations, but the newly restored castle kitchens give their own taste
of the past. For those of a military bent, the museum of the Argyll and
Sutherland Highlanders offers memories of battles long ago and armfuls
of regimental silver. Then there are the Stirling Heads in the
sixteenth-century Palace -- wooden carvings of men and women, many more
grotesque than bonnie, but full of vigour and character and period
detail, from clip of beard to padded dress.
Some of the original sitters may be buried in the Valley Cemetery, on
the west side of the castle hill. An unattributed quote on the gates
says: ''We know of no sweeter cemetery in all our wanderings than that
of Stirling''. And indeed, with its rocky outcrops and vantage points
over the stone mansions of Victorian Stirling, it seems as much a park
as place of the dead.
A poignant memorial of the Killing Days is that to Margaret
McLauchlan, the teenager who was staked in the Solway and drowned for
not renouncing her Presbyterian faith.
In spite of being protected by a glass case like a giant sweetie jar,
the group statue of Margaret, her sister, and guardian angel has been
vandalised. The sisters lack heads; the angel, wings.
It's a good time to visit the Church of the Holy Rude -- a cathedral
in all but name. It, too, echoed to Carver's polyphony before the
Reformation, and to the admonitions of John Knox after it. It saw the
hasty coronation of the infant James VI when his mother Mary Queen of
Scots was deposed. Divided in two, it did double duty for the
Presbyterian pious of several centuries.
A glimpse of former certainties is caught in the plaque to a
nineteenth-century ''Minister of Stirling'', as the plain old
phraseology has it. The Rev John Wilson, AM, DD, is described as ''a man
of varied learning, of fervent piety, and of great zeal in his master's
cause'' -- and there follows the biblical quote, ''They who turn many to
righteousness shall shine as the stars for ever and ever''.
Now the Holy Rude is a joint charge with another Stirling church. It's
also the setting for celebrity organ recitals. The Berlin Cathedral
Choir brings a programme of Bach and Schutz, among other composers, this
Thursday. However accomplished the German visitors, they could hardly
outdo the sweet young voices of the Dollar Academy choir, who performed
Haydn's Nelson Mass there last autumn with school orchestra and teenage
soloists. The old kirk was filled again with life and music.
There's a rash of plaques at the end of the nave, commemorating
Stirling philanthropists of various centuries. These include James IV's
tailor John Spittal -- who was responsible for ''many works of public
utility'' as well as founding a hospital for the poor -- and Thomas
Stuart Smith whose legacy is the Smith Art Gallery, the neo-classical
building on Dumbarton Road now under the direction of Elspeth King.
Another Stirling benefactor was responsible for the
seventeenth-century Guildhall beside the Holy Rude. He was John Cowane
and his pantalooned statue presides over the doorway. In this setting,
it's easy not to blink when Mary Queen of Scots glides past, looking
haughty and thunderous, as well she might after a verbal spat over
religion with her half-brother James, Earl of Moray.
Mary and James, alias members of the Sair Feet theatre company,
perform Sean Brady's tightly argued script at 3pm in the Guildhall. An
hour later they are back with reinforcements to re-enact the dilemma of
the provost of Stirling when Bonnie Prince Charlie laid siege to the
town in 1746, demanding surrender with menaces. ''It's just like
Bosnia,'' whispers my English companion.
Latecomers straying into the hall are addressed in the spirit of the
play. Most respond gamely; one or two retreat. Two pretty students --
computer-expert Lori from California and Sophie from Belgium -- are in
no doubt about their enjoyment. ''We loved it!''
Until a couple of years ago, the girls would have been staying in
Argyll's Lodging (or Ludging as the more demotic notices would have it).
This pink-washed seventeenth-century building must have been the
prettiest youth hostel in Britain. It's currently awaiting a new role,
perhaps for Stirling University. Meanwhile, down from the Holy Rude on
St John Street, past the old Detention Barracks (a storybook prison with
pepperpot turrets), the new youth hostel is doing a roaring trade.
It, too, is an old building transmogrified (or rather its facade has
been). It was the church of a doughty cleric called Ebenezer Erskine,
who once gave his name to a Herald column. Ebenezer -- a fine figure of
a man, to judge from his statue in the Valley Cemetery -- broke from the
Established Church a century before the main Disruption. A fancy
memorial in the grounds marks his remains. It is not simply public and
EC money that has brought about such pleasant developments, but the
imaginative response of the Stirling Initiative (a consortium of public
bodies) to the challenge of finding new uses for old buildings and of
generating new life at the top of the town. During a 10-year period,
says director Jim Maxwell, they hope to have #100m of public and private
money at their disposal. ''After two years #49m has already been
committed.''
Nowhere are the results more obvious than in Broad Street, the heart
of the old town where markets and riots used to be held (there was one
of the latter in 1706 over the proposed Act of Union). The old street,
bereft of the wealthy courtiers and merchants of earlier eras, until
recently exuded an air of disadvantage, despite brave efforts to bring
back commercial and cultural activity to it.
Now it is transformed. The street itself has been largely
pedestrianised, losing its symmetry in the process to wide pavements,
where trees and benches will tempt tourists to linger. Cannons guard the
lower approaches. The Mercat Cross will soon be reinstated.
Hanging baskets add lobelia blue and petunia pink to the high grey
facades of the old town houses. While comparable areas in other historic
towns would have been ''yuppified'', most property here will continue to
be rented out by the local authority. Additionally, various enterprises
have been encouraged to set up business.
Scots Wha Hae chimes out from the Tollbooth with its jaunty tower
designed in 1703 by Sir William Bruce. The unregretted past is marked by
a plaque to labour martyrs John Baird and Andrew Hardie who were
publicly hanged there in 1820 ''for the cause of justice and truth''.
No-one could grudge the public money spent on improving this
historically rich environment. But will the regeneration be robust
enough to sustain itself independently? That will be the real test.
Meanwhile, the omens are good. The little houses and gardens of St
John Place look prosperous as well as preserving the period flavour of
the area. The old Victorian Stirling High School building has been
imaginatively transformed into the Stirling Highland Hotel. Guests may
eat in the Scholars' Restaurant or Rizzio's (the layers of Stirling
history encourage these cultural conflations). Spittal Street has still
some way to descend before it debouches on the Corn Exchange and King
Street, where the modern shoppers' Stirling begins. It's high enough to
offer a view of Grangemouth's petrochemical chimneys in the distance.
Old and new, history and commerce, Stirling continues the balancing act
of centuries.
CLASSICAL PROPOSAL
* WALLACE at the Battle of Stirling Bridge, and Bruce at Bannockburn,
represented one temporarily triumphalist aspect of Scottish history. The
late-Renaissance Stewart kings, James IV and V, represented a kind of
golden era too -- though the battles of Flodden and Solway Moss ended
both reigns elegiacally.
One person who thinks it's high time to redress the balance on the
castle esplanade, where Bruce and a Boer War soldier are the only
statues, is neo-classical sculptor Sandy Stoddart. He wants to put a
statue of James IV -- man of culture, linguist, and good European --
there. Not a statue in period costume however, but one in Augustinian
armour with a lion at his feet, to represent the continuum of cultured
and civilised values that James IV embodied.
A maquette has been on display at the Smith Gallery, Stirling, as has
a giant head of the proposed figure. Public views have been sought. The
man who once sculpted Pat Lally and wants to decorate Glasgow Cross with
statues of Robert Adam and Piranesi is nothing if not visionary. But can
he make the public care?

Margaret Rigillo joins four British poets in Italy at a Poetry
Festival to commemorate John Keats's bicentenary
THE SUBJECT of hot debate over dinner on the first evening of the
Poetry Festival organised in Italy's Marche region as part of the John
Keats bicentenary commemorations: Roddy Cavaliero's assertion that Keats
came to Italy only for health reasons, and not because he felt the lure
of the Siren Land and the Eternal City of Rome, which Byron called ''My
country, city of the soul!''
Roddy, honorary treasurer of the Keats-Shelley Memorial association,
had kicked up a similar commotion at the Shelley bicentenary
celebrations in 1992 when he expounded his theory that it was Shelley's
liver, and not his heart, which Edward Trelawney recovered from the
poet's funeral pyre and reverentially presented to Mary Shelley.
Four foremost British poets -- Dannie Abse, Elaine Feinstein, Simon
Armitage, and Vicky Feaver -- had travelled to Italy with Roddy to
participate in the festival, the highlight of a year-long programme of
cultural events organised by the Keats-Shelley Memorial House in Rome to
mark the anniversary of the poet's birth in 1795.
Dannie Abse and Vicky Feaver also attended the bicentenary of
Shelley's birth, three years ago, taking a boat trip out to the Bay of
Lerici, where Shelley was tragically drowned, and scattering roses on
the water in his memory.
Throwing flowers from the upper-storey window of the house where Keats
died would not have had quite the same poetic impact, so the organisers
moved to a quieter venue, where the poet's memory could be honoured in a
suitable setting.
Thus, four British poets, 11 Italian poets, and a bevy of poetry fans
found themselves on a spiritual pilgrimage to the heart of Italian
Romanticism -- the green and undulating corner of Le Marche (pronounced
Marke) Region, on the Adriatic, immortalised by the leading Italian
romantic poet, Giacomo Leopardi.
Keats and Leopardi were contemporaries, born within three years of
each other; but they never met or even knew of each other's existence.
They were poles apart, physically and socially.
Keats was poor and lower-class and he came to Rome dying of a socially
unacceptable disease. Leopardi was born into the Italian provincial
aristocracy; yet his destiny was just as miserable. His childhood and
youth withered away. He was locked up in the family mansion by a
tyrannical father.
In the picturesque medieval town of Racanati, we wandered round the
eight rooms of the library of Palazzo Leopardi, kept exactly as it was
when the poet lived there, teaching himself Greek and Hebrew with the
aid of a polyglot Bible and reading every one of the 20,000 tomes
grouped under headings such as: Liturgy, Scripture, Jurisprudence,
Sacred and Profane History.
Vicky Feaver, whose latest book of poetry, The Handless Maiden,
centres on the theme of spiritual and personality handicap, lingered,
intrigued, by the locked cabinet labelled ''Forbidden'', set apart in
one of the rooms and filled with those books, like Mysteries of Paris
and The War of Women, which Leopardi Senior considered unsuitable for
his offspring's delectation.
The Leopardi family still live in their ancestral home, in the
palatial apartments above the library. Important visitors (like our
poets) are received personally by Countess Anna Leopardi in the vast and
glittering salon, and can take a stroll in the high-walled garden,
fragrant with roses, where a pale young boy once passed long days,
segregated from the other children of the village.
Current thought tends to revolve around Freudian theories of
deprivation to explain the vein of melancholy and pessimism which runs
through the works of both poets. Dannie Abse, however, believes that
Keats turned to poetry and the cult of beauty as a reaction against the
horrors of the operating theatre of Guy's Hospital, where he worked
until his fatal illness.
Dannie (like Keats) is a doctor, so he should know.
The unique, and in some ways daring (given the language problems)
post-mortem encounter between the two poets was engineered jointly with
the university of the nearby town of Macerata -- a venerable
institution, which celebrated its own 700th anniversary in 1990.
We were shown the charms of the area, which is one of Italy's best
kept secrets, untrodden as yet by any but the most discerning foreign
tourist.
This is a land of gentle scenery and ancient, hilltop villages,
Romanesque stone-hewn churches, endless vineyards, and famous religious
shrines. The town of Fabriano has been producing paper for artists for
hundreds of years, and little Castelfidardo is synonymous with
accordions, worldwide.
The magnificent sculpted marble screen encasing the Holy House of
Loretto was carved by the hands of 30 different artists of the
Renaissance, all of them famous. Like a modern Lorenzo il Magnifico, the
governor of the Bank of Macerata holds court in a sixteenth-century
palace -- open to visitors -- and crammed with the bank's priceless
collection of modern Italian art.
Little Recanati gave birth not only to Leopardi, but also to Beniamino
Gigli, one of the world's greatest tenors.
''Must be something in the air!'' remarked Simon Armitage. Despite a
nomination as the Sunday Times Young Writer of the Year and an
impressive list of poetry awards to his credit, he is refreshingly
unconceited. Earlier, in his soft Yorkshire accent, he had read us
Keats's Ode to a Nightingale and Robert Lowell's translation of
Leopardi's best loved poem, L'Infinito -- only one of the 39 different
English translations of this work.
It was a weekend rich in experience and emotion, and concluded with a
visit to the great Cistercian Abbey of Chiarvalle di Fiastra, with its
magnificent twelfth-century church of honey-coloured brick.
In a quiet corner of the cloister, our poets gave their farewell
readings of their own works. Given the circumstances, Elaine Feinstein's
recitation took on a special poignancy, as she described the unexpected
joys of growing older: ''The first surprise, I like it. Whatever happens
now, some things that used to terrify do not now.''
Keats died at 25, Leopardi before he was 40. Neither was fated to
enjoy such compensations.

Rennie McOwan surveys Scottish battlefields where mighty men fought
and won
Ah, freedom is a noble thing,
Freedom makes man to have
liking . . .
SO wrote John Barbour, fourteenth-century churchman and poet, and he
meant ''liking'' in the sense of self-respect and of a legitimate
dignity.
His ideals are stamped upon the central plain of Scotland, the narrow
belt that links the Firth of Clyde with the Firth of Forth, the
waistland of the nation and which was of such strategic importance long
ago.
This was the cockpit of Scotland, where so many invading armies of
contestants for the Scottish or British throne met and clashed and saw
their ideas upheld or collapse amid a welter of screaming cannon balls,
the swish of arrows, the clang of sword on shield and the roar of
frenzied fighting men.
It's all peaceful now, the big fields of the modern farms forming an
autumn green and gold patchwork, the quiet woods and little villages,
the rippling lochs and from the battlements of Stirling Castle or the
soaring 220ft tower of the Wallace Monument. The visitor looks at a
smiling landscape backed by the green ramparts of the Ochils and the
big, blue hills of the Highland line.
At least seven battles took place in this area and you can see them
all from the Wallace Monument. Some folk say you need a brave heart to
climb all 246 of the lighthouse-style steps inside, but there are big
rooms en route to the top where the visitor can rest. There are displays
of armour and weapons and one of the best audio/visual shows in
Scotland, where the story of Wallace and Bruce are told. Have a look at
the Hall of the Heroes and see how tastes change. It's fun to replace an
existing bunch from yesteryear with modern suggestions.
It is absorbing, too, once you have seen the film Braveheart to stand
on top of the 360ft Abbey Craig in the days before the Monument was
built from 1861-69. You can imagine the youthful Wallace, then only in
his late twenties, so skilfully commanding his army that he held it in
check until the English army in 1297 was in the worst of all positions,
half of the army on one bank of the River Forth, half still to cross on
the old wooden bridge, and a packed column on the bridge itself.
The famous bridge of the battle has long gone, but probably stood
upstream from the graceful, stone-arched bridge -- pedestrians only --
which stands alongside the modern road bridge and which was built by the
great Stevenson family of civil engineers, and who also produced Robert
Louis Stevenson who spent youthful holidays in Bridge of Allan.
In a bend of the Forth stands the ruins of Cambuskenneth Abbey, a
church site which produced abbots who provided the civil service for
Scottish monarchs and became ambassadors to France.
Stirling Castle on its great rock catches the eye from many quarters
and the people advocating new and obtrusive buildings on a fringing
industrial park deserve to be hurled off the Gowan Hill beside the
castle, where the old beheading stone still stands flanked by Crimea War
cannon. It is said Stirling is the brooch that clasps Highland and
Lowland together, and the castle and its famous bridge dominated this
strategic corner in the days when much of the land was bog and marsh.
If you are fortunate enough to live within the old boundary of the
former burgh of Stirling you are still admitted free to the castle
(which is in the care of Historic Scotland) on production of address
identification. This irritates Edinburgh people, who have to pay to get
into their castle. No-one is quite sure of the origin of this, but it
probably arose at some convivial town-and-military dinner when the
castle still had a garrison.
The castle contains many gems, but don't miss the museum of the Argyll
and Sutherland Highlanders, and its collection of silver. Some of the
battle displays are particularly moving today because of VJ-Day, and
tell of the Argylls' record in the 1941 Malayan campaign.
Stirling was a frontier town, and in the words of author Neil Munro,
it stood at the boundary of two ages, one of paper, one of steel. Here
the writ of monarchs and the Privy Council and other law-and-order
structures still operated. North of the Highland line lay the lands of
the clans, often turbulent and martial in spirit.
If you liked the film Rob Roy, then head for the Trossachs and the Rob
Roy visitor centre in Callander. It is good to compare the historical
reality with the myth: the truth is more impressive. The film had great
moments: the escape of the bound Rob Roy had its roots in a real
incident, and so had the opening shots of Rob recovering stolen cattle,
but it is very unlikely there was ever a rape or Rob would surely never
have let his enemies live.
The term The Trossachs -- the bristly ground -- was originally only
applied to this area around Loch Katrine and Loch Achray, but in modern
times it has gradually become a general term stretching almost as far as
the forestry village of Aberfoyle and almost to Loch Lomond-side.
There are many fine lochs in the area or nearby, including Loch Earn,
Loch Lubnaig, Loch Venacher, or the Lake of Menteith, with its island
abbey and memories of Mary Queen of Scots.
You can sail up Loch Katrine in a steamer to the head of the loch and
be in the track of the MacGregors' war galleys of long ago and can look
up Glen Gyle to where the real Rob Roy was born.
His memory lingers in many places in this area, and he is buried at
the old church at the Kirkton, in the Braes of Balquhidder (take care on
the narrow road).
This is a beautiful area of pleasant driving amid hills, moors, glens
and lochs. The Queen Elizabeth forest park centre at Aberfoyle has
splendid displays and water sports of all kinds at Loch Earn. If you
feel like going a bit farther afield don't miss the folklore visitor
centre at Killin, housed in an old mill with a working water wheel and
close to Loch Tay.
There are displays about clans, faeries, goblins, water beasts and
nature cures. The famous healing stones of St Fillan, a greatly revered
but shadowy saint, are kept there and the staff will let you touch them
if you think it will help ease an illness or your curiosity.
King Robert the Bruce had a fondness for St Fillan, and that takes us
back to Stirling and its fringes where Bruce once ruled, and where the
National Trust for Scotland has an informative visitor centre telling
the history of Scotland and the Battle of Bannockburn. You can put on a
knight's helmet and pose for family photographs.

Everything about Peter Howson's Don Giovanni is curvaceous and sey.
Clare Henry Visits the cherry and vermillion world he has created for
Scottish Opera's lavish new production
PETER HOWSON has spent the last year working on designs for scenery
and costumes for Scottish Opera's newest production, Mozart's Don
Giovanni, to be premiered in Glasgow on September 6. ''I'm doing it for
love not money, I can assure you! The budget is tiny. But I'm really
committed. It's an incredible opera and a fantastic opportunity. I've
got the opera bug now. I'd really like to do another one.''
The results are spectacular. Howson has married his characteristic
painting style with a brand new form of cubist angularity. ''Everything
to do with Don Giovanni is curvaceous and sexy. The rest is sharp,
pointed, and angular. I've kept the colour scheme very simple: rich
scarlet, vermilion, and cherry red for Don Giovanni's territory: his
bedroom, ballroom, the wedding-party scenes, and for hell. Soft greens,
greys, and cream for the rest. There's one basic angular, architectural
shape, a sort of futuristic giant headstone or slab that appears in many
guises. It works especially well in the graveyard and labyrinth scenes.
''I've used hundreds of irregular doors and windows, symbolic of the
intrigue, whispering behind twitching curtains and spying of suburban
minds, which eventually brings about the Don's downfall, but also a
metaphor for the way he can open doors for others. The doors are
practical too, and facilitate the many quick exits and entrances!''
Howson's 300 preparatory drawings (many of which are on show in this
exhibition together with models for the sets) bear witness to the
meticulous attention to detail and thorough research Howson has put into
the development of this project. As a bonus, you can see these drawings,
models, and costume designs, together with a new big oil painting
inspired by the party-scene nudes in the opera, at Billcliffe Fine Art
in Glasgow's Blythswood Street from September 9-29.
Howson is the first to admit that although he enjoys music, he was no
opera buff. But things have changed. A trip to Salzburg (with John Cox
and David Hockney as companions) was just one of the early forays I
heard him enthuse about. Since then Howson has swotted up via visits to
opera at home and abroad, plus many hours playing CDs and videos.
The stage sets, like his famous pictures, are bold, powerful,
painterly, and punchy -- unforgettable images which will have audiences
gasping and applauding. Some of Howson's harlots cavort across a 50ft
gauze backdrop at first glimpsed zinging red through the dark facade;
later more explicit. The figures are more than three times lifesize.
''There are hundreds of nudes everywhere, some friendly, some demonic.
It's like Dante's Inferno. Don Giovanni is a man of incredible sexual
appetite and John Cox wanted this depicted in a Rubenesque way: not
pornographic or smutty, but with as much nudity as Scottish
sensibilities allow. There's even nude caryatids and statuary carved
over the door to his palace. Although Scottish Opera's audiences can be
terribly Calvinistic. They don't want too much said about the nudes in
case people cancel their tickets!'' Surely not? ''It's true. It happened
once before with Life with an Idiot.''
Director John Cox is a long-standing Howson fan, having first bought
his work back in 1983 when Howson was barely out of Glasgow Art School.
Cox was aware that Howson had never designed for the stage -- but that
has never deterred the internationally-acclaimed Cox, if the artist is
good. After all, Cox introduced Hockney to opera design back in the mid
1960s. Hockney is now certainly the world's top artist for opera design.
''I was really keen for Peter to do Don Giovanni,'' Cox told me. ''I'm
very happy with the results.''
The results are incredibly dramatic, as befits an opera where the last
24 hours of the hero's life are packed with violent rape, duels, murder,
and death.
Howson explains: ''I see Don Giovanni as the life force. His bed is
red; his dressing gown is opulent, flowing gold and red. Of course he's
amoral, what used to be known as a libertine and blasphemer, but he's
also a free-thinker, a man before his time, a revolutionary who rejects
the religious and sexual code of his society. He's defiant and
unrepentant. He never forces himself on women, merely seduces.
''His affair with Donna Anna is the first time in his amorous career
that things have gone wrong. He doesn't feel guilty for the
Commendatore's death as the duel was fought in self-defence. When he's
dead the town stagnates and misses him.
''The Don Juan story has always been popular even in folklore. Back in
1787 when the opera was first performed in Prague it must have seemed
scandalous but today it's not so. We've tried to avoid setting the opera
in any specific period. Hopefully it's timeless.''
There are contradictions, of course. The libretto reqires Don Giovanni
to have a sword, rapier, and white feathers in his hat, but Howson's
street scenes also contain his ubiquitous urban street-lamp which curves
over the roads of Seville much as it does over Howson's Gorbals and East
End.
Contradictions too in the way the opera ricochets from stark tragedy
to high comedy and back. Both the music and Howson's sets emphasise
this, echoed by Don Giovanni's swing from charming irresponsible
womanising to callous villany, which would speedily be attacked and
shredded by today's Zero Tolerance campaigners.
Howson's costume drawings are a tour de force. Usually these are mere
linear sketches which focus on the clothes, leaving stylised head,
hands, legs, and feet largely to the imagination. Howson of course will
have none of that. His figures breathe, feel, and think; they have a
life of their own. Would one expect otherwise from such a virtuoso
draughtsman?
It's as though he's been designing suits and gowns all his life, so
that the cut, drape, and hang of the fabric leap off the page. As he is
not known for his interest in clothes, I asked if he'd been researching
in London's fashion establishments. ''Yes, I did!'' he admits.
The gang who seek to murder Don Giovanni at the end are God-given
material for Howson's trademark thugs. ''They don't even sing so I can
do stocking masks.'' Alongside these horrid lowlife creatures with their
bother-boots and baseball caps are the opera's noblemen and elegant
aristocratic women. Here Howson has gone to town on unusual, interesting
couture cuts, a mix of futurist and medieval influences in sleeves,
headdresses, stomachers, ballgowns, and cloaks.
These high-born folk only take on a menacing Howsonesque air as the
plot thickens and violence rears its ugly head. Donna Elvira is elegance
personified, ''my piece de resistance,'' says Howson, in turn seductive,
fascinating, and melancholy as she sings of her unrequited love. She is
also pregnant -- this will cause a stir -- and transforms into an
awesome, menacing figure when she, Anna, and Ottavio, all masked, appear
in the ballroom while festivities are in full swing, in order to accuse
Don Giovanni of murder.
He first appears in Howson's beloved green camouflage plus menacing
space-age visor ''because he's on enemy territory''. Later, if not
resplendent in theatrical Valentino velvet, he appears handsome but
nude.
Don Ottavio, Anna's wronged fiance, is the antithesis of Don Giovanni
but rather than foolish, he's been made bookish and scholarly with
waistcoat and specs. ''When he's out for revenge he appears in heavy
executioner's gear.'' Howson's drawings show plans for Don Ottavio a la
Ku-Klux-Klan leader, but for the performance these have been moderated!
Howson will paint some costumes actually on the singers. ''It's
sometimes cheaper for me to use fabric paint. The paint goes on the
material beautifully. The lead singers have fabulous rich satin, suede,
and velvet to wear but there's absolutely no cash left for the chorus.
It's a case of ready-made What Every Woman Wants off-the-peg dresses
painted over by me!''
''Dress by Howson.'' Lucky chorus! This could set a trend, I think to
myself.
There is much more: the Commendatore in long johns; Anna in sexy
X-rated lingerie; Zerlina in Turkish dress on her wedding night;
Leporello in Joseph Beuys's jacket; a sinister shadow which will
electify the finale.
Since 1964 there have been five Scottish Opera productons of Don
Giovanni, all controversial in some way. Howson's dramatic and colourful
re-interpretation will not be definitive -- but it will certainly be a
thrilling debut, I can assure you of that.
* Don Giovanni is premiered in Glasgow at the Theatre Royal on
September 6. The young Swedish baritone Peter Mattei appears in Britain
for the first time as the Don, with Donna Anna sung by Italian soprano
Francesca Pedaci, fresh from the same role in La Scala, Milan. Donna
Elvira is sung by Joan Rodgers, last seen at Scottish Opera as Cleopatra
in Julius Caesar. The conductor is Nicholas McGregan, principal guest
conductor. Performances run on Sept 9, October 26 and 31.

Anne Johnstone is moved by a remarkable show which is raising
consciousness as well as cash
A CANDLE
* ''A SEED has its own in-built energy to grow and blossom. But for a
meticulous gardener even a flower can become inconvenient. Social
gardeners like flowers to follow and comply with existing rules, and
inconvenient flowers are either eliminated or moved away from the
well-trimmed lawns of society. Some of these flowers still blossom,
leaving a fragrance on our path for generations to come. Their
contribution can be compared with that of a candle burning to brighten
our path. It can easily be ignored or blown out, yet it has the capacity
to light another thousand candles.''
Punjabi sculptor Avtarjeet Dhanjal. His piece A Candle appears in the
Freedom Exhibition at Kelvingrove Art Gallery.
THIS LAND'S NO JOY
''This land's no joy.
By day they wipe off sweat,
and tears by night.
To prison camps and barracks they all stream --
a trickle will come back.
Children look pale and sick, like young banana leaves.
Of ploughing women take full charge.
In hamlets not a glimpse of younger men.
Death notices drop thick and fast on thatch.
Here all is grief -- only
loudspeakers will spout joy.''
By Jack Mapanje, from Malawi. Prisoner of conscience, freed after the
Glasgow 1990 campaign.
SEEKERS OF JUSTICE
* ''Just call us seekers of true justice,
Not 'Burman', 'Shan', 'Kachin' or 'Kayah'.
Regardless of our nationality.

Makes a 20-year sentence
In this place they now call 'Myanmar'.''
Ma Thida from Myanmar (formerly Burma), poet and short-story writer,
sentenced to 20 years in prison for campaigning for the main opposition
party.
''Everyone has the right freely to participate in the cultural life of
the community (and) to enjoy the arts.''
Universal Declaration of
Human Rights, 1948.
ART has always been close to the core of the work of Amnesty
International, Britain's veteran human rights organisation. It's not
hard to see why. Art and freedom are siblings. Freedom is central to the
artistic impulse.
And yet the world over artists are in chains: harried, imprisoned,
tortured, killed. Why? Because they've drawn a picture, taken a
photograph, written a play or poem, sung or composed a song, or simply
expressed an opinion that has disturbed those in power. Wherever people
are challenging injustice, artists are in the frontline and they suffer
for it disproportionately. We rely on their courage and commitment for
the communication of the truth. Amnesty's best-known cultural prisoners
of conscience were probably Irina Ratushinska, the Soviet poet released
in 1985, and the Czech playwright-politician Vaclas Havel. There are
hundreds more.
In 1990, to mark Glasgow's designation as European City of Culture,
the city's Amnesty groups joined forces to campaign for the release of
three of them: Jack Mapanje, the poet from Malawi imprisoned without
trial after the banning of his collection of poems, Chameleons and Gods;
Hong Song Dam, the South Korean artist, creator of stark and violent
woodblock prints, who had been sentenced to seven years' imprisonment
for sending a photograph of a mural to North Korea; and Nguyen Chi
Thien, the Vietnamese poet, who disappeared following his arrest in
1979, after he had handed a manuscript of his anti-government poems to a
foreign diplomat.
Moved by their work, many people joined the campaign for their
release. Hundreds of children sent little paintings and drawings to the
three men in prison. Almost unbelievably, all three men were freed.
Encouraged by the campaign's success, Ann Drummond of Glasgow City AI
Group and Hazel Mills of Glasgow West hit on the idea of a major
contemporary art exhibition on the theme of freedom.
What happened next has a lot to do with the second reason why art and
Amnesty go together. Almost from its inception, Amnesty found that art
is a potent vehicle for their message. Artists realise that too. Many,
keenly aware of the restrictions and persecution their work would
attract elsewhere, have willingly rallied to the cause. The effect can
be devastating. (A stark cartoon of a man with his tongue nailed to a
table did more for my commitment to human rights than many thousands of
eloquent words.)
The Freedom Exhibition started to take shape. Angela Kingston was
taken on as curator and began to tour Britain in search of artists and
sculptors motivated by the freedom theme and who shared an interest in
Amnesty's work. At the same time something was stirring deep in
Glasgow's artistic community. ''The exhibition seemed to trigger off
thoughts in other organisations,'' says Drummond. Before long ''The
Freedom Exhibition'' had become ''The Freedom Festival'' and Ann and
Hazel found themselves editing a 16-page guide containing more than 100
events, all due to take place in Glasgow between now and January.
It kicks off next Sunday with the Freedom Gala at the King's Theatre,
a big musical extravaganza to raise awareness and lolly for Amnesty and
celebrate freedom of expression. Highlights will include jazz by Carol
Kidd and Tommy Smith and Scottish Opera with a special guest appearance
by Donald Maxwell. Scottish Ballet's contribution is Haydn Pieces, based
on three Haydn piano sonatas, choreographed by Mark Baldwin.
Composer James MacMillan will be there too conducting the Scottish
Chamber Orchestra in a performance of his short fanfare for brass and
percussion, They Saw the Stone had been Rolled away. It is based on the
section of the Easter story where the women encounter the angels at the
entrance to Christ's tomb. ''I thought it was appropriate because of the
sense of release and resurrection. It seems to fit in with Amnesty's
work for individual prisoners of conscience,'' says MacMillan.
MacMillan is also due to lead a composing workshop at Kelvingrove on
the freedom theme. ''A good deal of my music is influenced by some
extra-musical starting point. Usually there's some humanitarian aspect
so it was only a matter of time before an organisation like Amnesty came
into my mode of operation. My wife is an Amnesty member and this is
something I'm very pleased to be able to do,'' says MacMillan.
Meanwhile the Freedom Exhibition is taking form at Kelvingrove in
preparation for the opening on September 29. Kingston decided to focus
her selection on two strands of the freedom theme: ''On the one hand
there's work by artists who are motivated by a belief in the capacity of
art to bring about change. The exhibition juxtaposes this approach with
art which makes a bid towards freedom through the language of art. For
within abstract art there is a constant testing, a constant impulse to
experiment.''
There will be work by 15 artists, including Keith Piper and the late
Jo Spence. Pavel Buchler, a former prisoner of conscience, now head of
drawing and painting at Glasgow School of Art, has produced a new work
consisting of a cluster of microphones. He says: ''The sculpture will
explore the uncertainty of speaking and the difficulty of
self-expression: people who choose to speak into the microphones will
not know who will be listening, or if they will be understood.''
Details of a host of other events ranging from an exhibition of
cartoons and a mock human rights trial to a country house chamber
recital by members of the Scottish Symphony Orchestra are available in
the guide out this week.
Amnesty always needs money to fund its human rights campaigns but the
Freedom Festival is more about raising consciousness than cash. The
specific aim of the four-month-long festival is to repeat the success of
1990 and secure the release of three specific prisoners, adopted by
Amnesty.
Hwang Suk-yong is a popular South Korean novelist who was imprisoned
for visiting North Korea without government permission. He isn't due for
release until April 2000. In a recent letter from the Seoul Detention
House to those campaigning for his release, he said: ''Perhaps someone
is suggesting that I hibernate through the dark and gloomy end of this
century and wake up in the new century.''
Manuel Manriquez San Agustin is a musician from Mexico, arrested
without a warrant in Mexico City in 1990. In police custody he was
beaten brutally, almost asphyxiated, and received burns and electric
shocks. He was forced to sign papers he did not understand and was then
sentenced to 23 years' imprisonment on a murder charge on the basis of a
''signed confession''.
Amnesty International has called for his immediate and unconditional
release as a prisoner of conscience.
Ma Thida from Myanmar (formerly Burma) is a well-known short-story
writer arrested in 1993 and sentenced to 20 years for ''endangering
public tranquillity''. This related to her campaigning work for the main
opposition party and the distribution of literature including one of her
own poems, criticising the Government's human rights record.
She has been held in solitary confinement for more than a year and
suffers from a gastric ulcer and endometriosis.
So the Glasgow Freedom Festival is both a celebration of artistic
freedom and a call for it. Artists participating in the Festival have
the freedom to give their time and talent for a cause they believe in.
Hwang Suk-yong, Manuel Manriquez San Agustin, and Ma Thida don't. As the
brochure puts it bluntly: ''That is what this festival is all about.''

John Fowler and illustrator Mark McLellan look to Titan for clues of
how life on earth began
THIS month Mark McLellan pictures a moon landing, though not on the
moon we all recognise. This one is Titan, the largest of the planet
Saturn's 18 known satellites. There may be more moons in and around
Saturn's famous rings, but any others have still to be discovered.
Parachuting in on Titan is a probe called Huygens at the start of a
mission which should add considerably to our knowledge of Titan and may
even -- though this is rather a remote possibility -- provide some clues
to how life on earth began. There is some speculation that Titan may
resemble what the earth was like at a very early stage in its
development.
So far Titan has remained veiled by its thick covering of
orange-coloured clouds in a gassy atmosphere composed of nitrogen and
methane. Huygens will, if all goes well, penetrate the clouds and
investigate the geological features below.
In this case Mark has had recourse to his crystal ball. What we see
here won't happen for at least nine years. The mission should commence
in October 1997 when the unmanned spacecraft Cassini, with Huygens on
board, will be launched from Cape Canaveral as a joint project of Nasa,
the European Space Agency, and the Italian Space Agency. Landfall -- or
rather moonfall -- is scheduled for late in 2004 when Huygens will
detach itself from Cassini and plummet through Titan's atmosphere. As it
slows down its protective shield will be discarded and the parachute
will open.
But don't note the date in your diaries yet. Space programmes have a
habit of slipping, and the Cassini/Huygens venture is already late.
''What's Huygens like, Mark?'' I ask. Comes the reply: ''It's rather
like a squashed cylinder with wee legs sticking out'', which is not
exactly a graphic description. Judge for yourselves. Beware, by the way,
of confusing Titan with Triton, which is also a moon but one of
Neptune's.
Once safely settled on Titan's crust, it's hoped that Huygens will
continue to send information back to the parent ship, where the data
will be processed and transmitted back to earth. In its perambulations
Cassini will have some 30 encounters with Titan, and will also visit
four other satellites.
Why Cassini and why Huygens? The names are apt. Both refer to
seventeenth-century astronomers who observed Saturn. Giovanni Domenico
Cassini discovered four of Saturn's moons and the gap in Saturn's rings
now known as the Cassini division, while Christiaan Huygens was the
first to spot Titan.
At the moment Saturn's rings present themselves as a thin edge, which
is how astronomers like to view them for best results. As the rings tilt
during the next few years more of the surface will reveal itself to the
amateur with binoculars, until they reach their full glory in about
seven years' time. By 2009 they'll be edge-on again.
As Mark's chart shows, Saturn is in Aquarius. Jupiter, still a
brilliant object, is in Scorpius and Mars is low in the south-east, in
the constellation Libra.
The constellation Cassiopeia is almost directly overhead and very easy
to find. Its features resemble the letter W. There are a number of
variables -- stars that fluctuate in the brightness -- in Cassiopeia,
including the star known simply as Gamma, which is the Greek letter for
G. Four clusters can also be located in the diagram.

Although his talents were widely spread, Fiona Pearson believes that
William Wilson excelled in each of his chosen fields
WILLIAM WILSON (1905-1972) was an unusualfigure in the history of
twentieth century Scottish art with a career that spanned three separate
fields. He played a major role in the renaissance of stained glass at
home and abroad. The brilliant colours and strong draughtmanship of his
windows drew upon the tradition of medieval cathedrals as well as
exploring the developments in contemporary glassmaking in Germany,
France and Britain. In printmaking Wilson contributed a uniquely
expressive interpretation of landscapes, towns and harbours. Finally, he
was a prolific painter in watercolour of glowing landscapes. Wilson was
more passionate than John Maxwell or William Gillies in his treatment of
the Scottish landscape and equalled only by his friends Anne Redpath and
William MacTaggart in the power of his work, regardless of size or
medium.
Wilson was born and educated in Edinburgh. He had a brief spell as a
cartographer and in 1920 began work in the stained glass studio of James
Ballantine. In the evenings Wilson attended the etching classes of Adam
Bruce Thomson at Edinburgh College of Art. In 1932 Wilson won the Royal
Scottish Academy Carnegie Travelling Scholarship and got leave from
James Ballantine to study full-time at Edinburgh College of Art.
Wilson developed a very personal style of landscape etching. He was,
like his friend and contemporary, Ian Fleming, aware of the need to
express mood in a composition. In Wilson's case he was inspired to make
dark expressive etchings of the Scottish Highlands. In 1935 he also
studied at the Royal College of Art in London where he met and worked
with the young printmaker Edgar Holloway. Wilson produced a series of
lyrical neo-romantic scenes of the English countryside after the manner
of Samuel Palmer.
Stained glass continued to be an interest for Wilson throughout his
college years and upon his graduation in 1937 he set up a stained glass
studio in Frederick Street. Wilson wrote of the need for a window to
tell a story and of the role of light in the planning of a work. His
first major series of windows was for the Caledonian Insurance Company
in Edinburgh. The three monumental windows celebrated every area of
contemporary Scottish life. Wilson had an expressive figure style that
owed much to his study of German art and the Romanesque.
Over the next two decades Wilson became the leading stained glass
artist in Scotland. He executed windows for all over the British Isles
and the Commonwealth. The most notable series is at Brechin Cathedral.
The long expressive figures in brilliant colours were painted from a
cartoon, freehand on to the glass before firing. There was always a
simplicity in his compositions.
Wilson also admired the naivety of the painter Christopher Wood. His
early watercolours of harbour scenes in Britanny and Fife were in homage
to Wood. However Wilson soon developed a rich personal style in
watercolour paintings. He travelled with his friend Anne Redpath to
France to paint Paris street scenes and olive groves. Wilson was a
prolific painter right up until the last decade of his life when, as a
diabetic, he lost his sight.
Wilson was awarded an OBE for his services to art in Scotland in 1961.
He was the Honorary Secretary of the Society of Artist Printmakers
during the 1930s, a governor of Edinburgh College of Art, librarian of
the Royal Scottish Academy and an active member of the Scottish
Committee of the Arts Council. However Wilson will be remembered on the
Scottish art scene as the Scottish printmaker par excellence during the
inter-war period and the leading post-war exponent of stained glass.

IT'S the sort of crazy, charming encounter you come to expect here on
the Atlantic edge. Harry Flynn and I were talking smuggling. You'll know
Harry, of course. Three-times Mayor of Beverley, East Yorks, world
traveller, cyclist extraordinary, and a man who has happily left his
three-score years and ten trailing in his slipstream.
Over a cup of tea in the village hall Harry was telling me how in the
early eighties he sneaked a typewriter into Poland as Solidarity began
to push for new freedoms. The machine was used to produce some of the
movement's first news-sheets.
During our blether I suddenly realised that my own attitude towards
our customs service was, to say the least, double-edged, ambivalent
even. They do an awfully important job keeping undesirable people and
substances out of this country but, oh dear, they do have this uncanny
knack for getting up yer humph.
My cynicism, I explained to Harry, stems from an incident a quarter of
a century ago at Newhaven when, having been out of the country for a
little longer than most folk, we were waved into the dismantling shed
while customs officers took our beloved Land Rover -- our first home as
it happens -- apart. It felt like officially sanctioned burglary.
More recently, an incident at Hull had me shaking my head. We arrived
for the Zeebrugge ferry in our wee hatchback and were politely directed
to one side for inspection. Turned out they were looking for guns.
We were ready to forgive and forget until we cruised into the
marshalling area to find ourselves in the midst of 1000 high-powered
motorbikes, crewed by a cross-section of the toughest bikers in Europe,
returning from the TT races in the Isle of Man. Was every machine and
panier in this motorised regiment checked? I don't think so.
It was Harry who reminded me of one of the most intriguing but almost
forgotten Scottish smugglers who paid with his life for messing around
with the excisemen. Andrew Wilson had broken into the house of the
collector of excise at Pittenweem in Fife and made off with money and
goods, having borne a grudge against the excise authorities for some
time.
Reason for Andrew's relative anonymity is that his execution in 1736
was overshadowed by the actions of one John Porteous, captain of
Edinburgh's town guard, who ordered his men to fire on the angry crowd,
killing six citizens. Porteous, of course, was later lynched by the
self-same mob.
Before going to meet his maker in the Grassmarket Wilson made a couple
of parting gestures that deserve to be better remembered.
Five days before the date set for execution Wilson and his fellow
condemned George Robertson, a stabler from outside the city's
Bristoport, made a break for freedom. Alas, Wilson, a squat man by all
accounts, got himself firmly lodged in a grated window. Two days later
the prisoners were being taken, as was the tradition, from the Tollbooth
to a service in adjacent church when the amazing wee man seized a guard
with each hand, grabbed a third with his teeth, allowing Robertson to
knock down the fourth and flee.

SLENDER wings with a five-foot span, a long, forked, russet, jinking
tail, an ashy head and yellow claws and eyes make the red kite one of
the most beautiful Scottish birds. To see a kite high over a Ross-shire
wood, those long wings angled and the red tail jinking in the sunlight,
is to understand why it is kites not eagles that children fly on the
beach.
They are gliders and soarers, chasers of rook chicks, frogs and half
grown rabbits, but above all scavenger -- particularly partial, in Wales
at least, to lamb's docked tails and scrotal sacs. Incredibly, it is
once again possible to find these birds wandering the sheepwalks and
marshes of the Highlands.
Why is such a sight so amazing? Because no bird was wiped out so
easily in Britain as the red kite. In 1777 it was recorded breeding in
central London, where it had been a thief of human refuse for centuries.
But the proneness to desertion of the ''coward kite'' (as Chaucer called
it) and its fidelity to nest site, as well as its propinquity to man,
made it an easy target for destruction.
Gamekeepers finished what cleaner streets had begun and by 1905 there
were just five pairs left, in the hanging oakwoods of remote Welsh
valleys. For 50 years this toehold was protected by a virtual secret
society of Welsh enthusiasts and slowly, slowly the kite's numbers rose
to the present level of more than a hundred birds.
In 1992 reintroduced kites bred in Scotland for the first time since
1917. They are still rare so if you see one note whether it has wing
tags, read them if you can and notify the RSPB at Beechwood Park,
Inverness IV2 3BW. Meanwhile enjoy the sight as ''the soaring kite there
scantled (drew in) its long wings'' (Michael Drayton 1622). Shakespeare,
too, knew the kite's nesting materials well: ''When the kite builds,
look to lesser linen.'' We await the first report in the P &amp; J of the
theft of a good pair of Inverness knickers from the line.

Bruce Sandison finds that old monuments and buildings can help give us
an understanding of our ancestors
THIS morning, say hello to your ancestors. The people who inhabited
these islands before recorded time. The evidence of their passing
surrounds us, from the Shetland Isles to the Border line: settlements,
chambered tombs, standing stones, cairns, homesteads, hill-forts, duns
and Pictish symbol stones. A remarkable remembrance of thousands of
years of human endeavour.
They are as much a part of Scotland's story as the Battle of
Bannockburn -- and as deserving of study. Perhaps even more so, because
it is from these roots that our Scottish culture and independent
identity spring. The old monuments mark our ancestors' presence and
their past wonderfully enhances our present.
Custom and curiosity are cornerstones of the way we live. The more we
understand our past, the better able we are to understand the present.
In these frenetic, sound-bite times, when almost every aspect of human
existence is reduced to the lowest common denominator, an appreciation
of our archaeological heritage brings into sharp focus the way we live
now.
Some years ago I crawled into the centre of the round burial cairn at
Camster in Caithness, one of the finest examples of Neolithic chambered
cairns in Europe. The stones have dominated the bleak moorland for more
than 4500 years and as I inched along the 20-foot entrance passage, on
hands and knees, I thought of the enormous effort required to erect the
cairn; thousands of tons of rock, meticulously assembled, long before
the building of the Great Pyramid in Egypt.
Begin your journey into the past in Edinburgh, at the Council for
Scottish Archaeology (CSA). The council seeks to promote informed
opinion concerning the study and conservation of Scotland's
archaeological heritage and it brings together individuals, societies,
and organisations in order to do so. Membership is open to everyone
committed to Scottish archaeology.
Members receive three newsletters each year, an annual copy of
Discovery &amp; Excavation in Scotland, the opportunity to participate in
practical work, and the chance to attend an annual summer school. In
October, the second ''Archaeological Extravaganza'' will be held in
Edinburgh. The 1994 event had displays from 35 bodies representing all
aspects of Scotland's archaeological community and attracted 800 members
of the public and widespread media interest.
The more informed you are, the better you will appreciate the
significance of our arachaeological heritage. The council, and its
members, will help you to achieve this.Unhappily, not as much can be
said for government, particularly as expressed by Forest Enterprise, the
''arm'' of the old Foresty Commission with environmental responsibility.
Our archaeological heritage is irreplaceable and the CSA has expressed
grave concern that Forest Enterprise must now cover all its costs
without Treasury support. The CSA believes our ancient monuments will
suffer in consequence.
There is an archaeological site near you and most are easily
accessible to the public: Criagmarloch Wood Fort, north-west of
Kilmacolm in Renfrewshire (OS Map 63, Gd ref: 344718); Walls Hill Fort
(OS Map 64, Gd ref: 411588), the principal base of the Dammnonii tribe,
on a rocky plateau overlooking Whittleimuir Midton Loch near Johnstone;
Duncarnock Fort (OS Map 64, Gd ref: 500559), south of Barrhead, near
Glanderston Dam.
South Scotland has some of the most important archaeological monuments
in Britain: Traprain Law Fort (OS Map 67, Gd ref: 581746), the East
Lothian ''capital'' of the Votadini tribe, where a magnificent hoard of
Roman silver was found during the early years of the present century;
Arthur's Seat Fort (OS Map 66, Gd ref: 275728), in Holyrood Park,
Edinburgh; Eildon Hill North Fort (OS Map 73, Gd ref: 555328), the home
of the Selgovae, near Melrose on the banks on the River Tweed.

THE log stove was giving out a hand-warming heat, the hors d'oeuvres
lay invitingly on the table, and there was fresh ice in a bucket on the
fridge. I slipped in for a shower, changed for dinner, and got to
thinking that I was in one heck of a place.
I'd caught and returned several salmon during the day, seen a bear
paddling along the opposite bank, and watched a bald eagle harry an
osprey for its fish supper. Now, you would expect this sort of thing on
the Alagnak River in Alaska. After all, I was 300 miles from the nearest
road in the middle of the tundra, and the chum and silver salmon were
running in prolific numbers. This wild side of life is stunning, but so
is the realisation of one man's passion for the river.
I was on my second trip to the Alagnak and Alaska and if anything, was
more impressed than on my first visit. The river is just fabulous. It
originates in Kukaklek Lake in Katmai National Park and flows about 75
miles to the south-west to empty into the Kvichak River and so into
Bristol Bay and the Bering Sea. The river carries all five species of
Pacific salmon as well as natural populations of rainbow trout, arctic
char and grayling. But it is the sheer numbers of salmon that boggle the
mind. Vast numbers of huge Chinook or King salmon. Sockeye, let's say a
couple of million, and the largest run of chums in the world, I am told,
with huge numbers of pinks and silvers.
You can take all the salmon species on fly. This time I had the
pleasure of taking chum salmon on a dry fly. Well, that's maybe putting
it in a wishful-thinking way. I was actually fishing a bright pink
elk-hair lure, a vast pink muddler minnow sort of thing with a pink
marabou tail. This is called a Polywog by its inventor, and since chum
are also known as dog salmon, you are, quite naturally, ''Wogging the
Dogs''. It is great fun and I think we have got some great action for
our new series of fishing programmes.
I'm not sure if Tony Sarp tried wogging the dogs on his first raft
trip to the river 17 years ago, but he was certainly impressed by what
he saw. So much so that he decided to set up a camp and share the river
with others. Over the years, he has expanded and improved and today
Katmai Lodge is a testament to his determination, grit, and passion. It
sits on a bluff overlooking the river, with a main lodge, a dining-room,
and separate guest buildings. You have showers, hot and cold running
water (you can drink the water, by the way!), flushing toilets and all
the kinds of amenity that take the roughness out of roughing it and it
is the logistics of running the place that fascinate me.
At the end of ice-melt, the camp starts into life for another season.
Upwards of 800 anglers will be coming to visit and all non-perishable
food, all the fuel for the four generators and the 40 or 50 outboard
motorboats are brought in by barge.
All the flour for the hundreds of loaves of bread and the thousands of
breakfast pancakes . . . and all the maple syrup too . . . all the pasta
for the spaghetti bolognaise and the chicken noodle soup. And of course
the chickens. The spares for the generators and outboards. New hacksaw
blades, fly lines, and light-bulbs. Toilet rolls, soap, and towels.
Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon to be served free at dinner and
thousands of cans of soda, beer, and soft drinks.
But I like the little touches I mentioned earlier . . . the logs
burning merrily, the nibbles and the ice if you fancy a drink. And on
the last day of your trip you are met at the pier with a welcoming,
warming glass of cognac. And all this because Tony took a liking to the
river. Mind you, he is not in the charity business. It is not cheap to
stay at Katmai, but it sure is comfortable.
And the fishing is superb. Whether you fish little dry flies for the
grayling up river or bright pink polywogs for the dogs downriver, a week
in Alaska on the Alagnak at Katmai Lodge will give you a lifetime of
memories.

Peter Evans looks at an initiative to widen walking opportunities and
attract visitors to Borders region
The region is seamed with tracks and paths so you can walk for an
hour, a day or a week, whatever you fancy
FEW people in life are fortunate enough to earn a living from their
leisure interest. Roger Smith is one of them. For someone who enjoys
walking as much as he does, what job could be better than walking
development officer for Borders region?
Smith is definitely a round peg in a round hole in establishing a
pioneering project unique to Scotland, likely to prove a model for other
local authorities. Indeed in the first year the project has been
running, he has received a good deal of interest and entertained
representatives from authorities as far apart as Aberdeenshire,
Inverness, and Clackmannanshire.
With a background as an author of walking books and founding editor of
The Great Outdoors magazine for walkers, he brings a wealth of
experience to the post.
''The underlying aim is to bring economic benefit to the area, which I
think we can now demonstrate we are starting to do,'' explains Smith,
who saw his job advertised in the magazine he used to edit and made up
his mind within five minutes that it was tailor-made for him.
The project in which he is engaged, funded initially for two years, is
a two-pronged initiative to widen the range of walking opportunities in
Borders region and promote the area as a walking location for visitors.
It involves a four-way partnership of Scottish Borders Enterprise,
Scottish Natural Heritage, the Scottish Borders Tourist Board, and
Borders Regional Council.
Smith's starting point when he began formulating a strategy 12 months
or so ago, was that Borders region is an under-used resource for
walkers. Covering an area of about 1800 square miles and with a
population of just under 100,000 people, it is far from crowded, with
plenty of open space to offer,
A promotional brochure describes it as ''a land of contrasts'' -- one
of Europe's most beautiful unspoilt regions. For the walker it offers
space to breathe clean air and feel free, and to visit many fascinating
historical sites.
''There are green rolling hills, large mature forests, superb river
valleys, and interesting towns and villages. The region is seamed with
tracks and paths so that you can walk for an hour, a day or a week,
whatever you fancy.''
A little heavy on the hyperbole perhaps, but there's no doubt that
many walkers fail to recognise the region's assets. Munro-baggers, for
instance, will find nothing to capture their attention here, for there
are no summits of 3000ft.
Borders walking is more gentle; the beauty of the region more subtle,
and the gospel Smith preaches that these features make it just as
attractive in its own right. As to history, he adds: ''You fall over it
all the time here in the form of the Romans and the drovers, with the
figure of Sir Walter Scott always looming in the background.''
One of Scotland's long-distance trails -- the coast-to-coast Southern
Upland Way already passes through Borders region. It is a long walk if
undertaken in its entirety, covering 212 miles from Portpatrick in the
west to Cockburnspath in the east.
''If you are going to do it all it demands your main holiday,'' says
Smith. ''You have got very long stretches of 20-25 miles with virtually
no facilities whatsoever. But it's there to be used, and what we are
trying to do is make access to and from it easier.''
He is a great believer in presenting walkers with a variety of
alternatives instead of channelling them along a single corridor. Some
of the footpath management problems on the popular West Highland Way
have been created because of this, he argues.
''There are a lot of people who come to Scotland and are not certain
of the position about where they can walk. It's no good pushing free
access at them because they are not happy with that. These are general
visitors who enjoy some walking but want to feel quite safe. They want a
little bit of guidance and I see nothing wrong in that.''
The first year has been spent scanning the maps for potential walking
lines, then beginning to get out on the ground and seeing if they are
actually passable. Smith describes this as ''a snakes-and-ladders
process''.
Progress can go swimmingly well -- sometimes better than expected --
then a snag will crop up. Sometimes a path will be marked on the map
which doesn't exist on the ground: a section may be badly overgrown and
need clearing, or a landowner may be unhappy about permitting access.
In this last context, Smith is keen to stress that ''it is of
fundamental importance that we work with all farmers and landowners. I
can't go around imposing things on people, it can only be done through
co-operation and agreement,'' he says.
To oil the wheels and prevent raising hackles, he has sensibly created
a local walking forum composed of interest-group representatives,
farmers, and landowners. ''It's enormously valuable to get people around
a table and talk things through,'' he says.
One scheme on the drawing board is a Four Abbeys walk, linking the
historic abbeys of Melrose, Dryburgh, Kelso, and Jedburgh -- about 60
miles of ''very pleasant walking'' which can be done in manageable
sections. Of the chosen route, 60% is there, with work still to be done
on the remaining 40%.
Another line is a coastal trail from Berwick-on-Tweed to St Abbs, with
a possible extension to Dunbar. Of the Berwick to St Abbs stretch, Smith
says he only has around five miles -- from the Border to Burnmouth -- to
sort out.
''Quality'' is something he emphasises in the provision of routes, and
he is meticulous in his approach to checking that everything is done
properly.
In his efforts to focus on the Borders as a walking location, Smith
has initiated a Festival of Walking, to be held from September 9-16.
Planned as a ''celebration of walking and the countryside'', it will
be centred on the Peeblesshire village of West Linton and organised by
the West Linton area tourist group. The event is designed to appeal to a
wide variety of walkers of all ages, with an itinerary of guided and
self-led walks available each day, backed up by a programme of
exhibitions, demonstrations, talks, and displays.
Another information initiative is an accommodation list for walkers;
addresses where they can be confident of being made welcome and where
the facilities they need -- like a drying room for wet clothes -- are
provided.
Smith's work is beginning to bear fruit. Walking-holiday companies are
starting to show more interest in the area, and with tourism high on the
agenda for fuelling the economy, not only in the Borders but all over
Scotland, it is proving that walkers -- properly provided for -- can
contribute a great deal, at the same time as enjoying themselves in the
countryside.

Eileen Goodchild laments the unrecognised impact of two mills which
were once
an integral part of Glasgow industry and are now in ruin and
obliterated from
memory
THIS summer, at an estimated cost of #120,000, repair work started on
the weir across the River Kelvin in Glasgow just below Queen Margaret
Bridge and opposite the BBC. The dangerous condition of the weir raised
fears that it was about to collapse and, in doing so, alter the water
level with potentially disastrous consequences to the foundations of
Queen Margaret Bridge. When the repair work was put in hand, plans were
also made to clear the hogweed and rubbish out of the mill lade and
reflood it to relieve the build-up of pressure, but funds would not
stretch that far.
The weir and its race supplied the power to turn the wheel of the
North Woodside Flint Mill whose scanty remains can still be seen 100
yards further downstream. A tiny, ancient bridge spans the lade. The
area above the mill has all the charm of a secret garden and once it was
the miller's garden. Here the miller's wife grew rhubarb and kept a cow,
chickens, and big, white ''Aylesbury'' ducks. Today, flanked by the
Kelvin on one side and the mill-race on the other, it forms a welcome
sanctuary for many birds. A face, reminiscent of the traditional green
man, has been carved into the stones of the walkway wall at the rear of
the mill and gazes enigmatically at its remains.
The mill ceased working around 1955, and around 1972, when the walkway
was created, the remains were considered interesting enough to be
landscaped and given a Grade B architectural listing. But nobody seems
to know this.
Since then I have watched the kiln in which the flints were calcined
being relentlessly destroyed by bored and thoughtless children. The
great millstones are still there because they are too heavy to move.
People walk past and wonder what the site is all about.
Yet this, the North Woodside Flint Mill and the Garrioch Mill which
stood by the river between Queen Margaret Bridge and Kirklee Bridge,
about 200 yards further upstream, ground and prepared the ingredients
that were used by one of Glasgow's oldest industries. They were
processing the basic materials, flint and Cornish stone, used by the
Verreville Flint Crystal Glass and Pottery Works at Finnieston.
Flint crystal glass is hard and bright; it has a high index of
refraction. Its density is close to that of diamond and it retains some
of the light instead of reflecting it. Under the hand of a judicious
cutter it can be made to sparkle like a gem. Flint is used in the
manufacture of pottery to give hardness to white earthenware and
ironstone china. It also produces a hard and clear glaze which is a thin
film of glass.
In those days the flints were brought to this country in large
quantities as ballast in returning coal barges. At the mill the flints
were burned in the kiln until they became white and friable, though
still hard. Then they were placed in grinding tubs filled with water and
ground for about eight hours under the weight of the great quartzite
millstones that came from Ballachulish. Grinding reduced the flints to a
thick, creamy fluid which was run off into heated vats and dried. The
paste that formed was cut into blocks and bagged or packed into kegs
ready for dispatch.
Transporting heavy loads of flint paste and Cornish clay wasn't easy.
All the materials, raw and processed, were carried to and from the mills
by pack animals. An old Verreville-trained potter, Johnstone Wardlaw,
who became the manager of the Britannia Pottery, was given the task of
collecting the various pastes from Woodside and Garrioch when he was
just a boy starting his apprenticeship circa 1850.
The kegs containing the paste were slung on each side of a pack-donkey
and he had charge of a string of six. There were no roads of any kind to
Finnieston, just a rough path over a bare hillside where Park Terrace
now stands. It was midwinter and he had the misfortune to be caught in a
storm halfway up the hill. The donkeys became stubborn and the leader
refused to move. The tail-end beast tried to turn back and the others
followed the example of the leader.
There were happier summer days and he enjoyed catching trout in both
the mill lades. All the lads learned to swim in the Garrioch lade and
were considered proficient when they could swim its full length. The
dredged-out lade was kinder to knees and feet than the sharp, stony bed
of the Kelvin.
Milling at Woodside has a long history. The first mill, a barley mill,
is shown on a map dated 1650. In 1758 the mill was advertised for sale
in the Glasgow Journal. It seems to have been purchased by David
Jackson. He certainly worked it and his wife managed the cow, the
chickens, and the ducks. The weir became known as Jackson's dam. During
the Napoleonic Wars both the mills were used for grinding gunpowder.
In 1846 Robert Cochran of Verreville took it over, pulled it down, and
built the flint mill in its place. This mill was worked steadily for
more than a century. Its neighbour, the Garrioch Mill, was burned down
accidentally at the turn of the century.
Verreville (Glass City) is a name that still calls to mind the ''Auld
Alliance'' and the glass-makers who brought their skills here from
Flanders. It was started in 1776 by a glass-maker, Patrick Colquhoun,
who supervised the building of its spectacular 120ft-high brick cone,
which contained the ovens of the glass-blowers and then the ''glost'' or
glazing kilns of the potters. As Colquhoun had a number of other
enterprises and little time for glass-making, Verreville was transferred
around 1785 to the highly successful glass-maker, John Geddes.
Cut-glass tableware of all kinds was produced, most of it for export.
Uisge-beatha (whisky) and its derivative ''Athole Brose'' had arrived on
the scene at the start of that century. Inns and taverns catering for
cherished Scottish traditions of conviviality provided a flourishing
market for tumblers and glasses of all shapes and sizes. Geddes opened a
glass depot at Perth, the great market-town of the north, and became
part-owner of an inn at Inverness.
The glass hawkers packed the glass into panniers padded with hay and
struggled with their pack animals across some of the wildest country in
Scotland. Glass goods were bartered for black cattle and small Highland
ponies which were always in demand for work in the coalmines.
A century earlier, glass-making in England had given Scottish
coal-mining an unexpected boost. Alarmed that the great forests were
being destroyed to supply wood for the hungry glass-making furnaces
James VI and I passed a decree in 1615 forbidding the use of timber for
fuel. Suddenly ''sea'' coal from Scotland was in great demand. It was
the higher temperature achieved by burning coal in the glass furnaces
that made possible the use of lead as an essential constituent in a new
metal, flint glass.
In 1838 R A Kidson took over Verreville and under his leadership the
pottery side of the business was promoted. Soon he was producing china
of outstanding quality and persuaded artists from Derby, Coalport,
France, and Flanders to work for him. Unfortunately he misjudged his
market -- there was a restricted demand for such exotic and expensive
wares at that time. He ran into financial difficulties and the business
was taken over by a far shrewder potter, Robert Cochran.
From then on, Verreville potters made good, sound, white domestic
earthenware, nicely finished and attractively, but inexpensively,
decorated. Later Cochran introduced the manufacture of ''Royal Ironstone
China'', exporting most of it to America. This china required great
quantities of calcined and ground flint and Cornish stone which was
processed at the Garrioch mill. Needing a greater supply he first leased
and then purchased and rebuilt the North Woodside Flint Mill.
J Arnold Fleming, himself a potter, whose father was trained at
Verreville, tells us that in the summer the Verreville potters,
including his father, used the spring at Kirklee as a trysting place.
They enjoyed walking past the mills. ''There is always,'' he wrote,
''something picturesque about a water-driven mill.''
Like the Kirklee spring, Verreville was brought to an end when the
Caledonian railway was built. The mill at Woodside continued to grind
flints for another half century, supplying the Paisley potteries with
raw glaze for tiles and sanitary ware.
A couple of years ago the council proposed to place information boards
at intervals along the Kelvin Walkway and I was invited to supply the
details. This was when the link between the walkway and the West
Highland Way was officially opened by Jimmy MacGregor, MBE. Everything
was agreed and then the money ran out. All we have now are a few signs
that say ''Kelvin Walkway'' coupled to the logo of a flying duck. Surely
there is enough money somewhere to supply a reasonably vandal-proof
information board by the mill.

A ballpoint may be convenient and practical but scratch the surface
and you'll find most writers would prefer a fountain pen, says Liz
Taylor
BALLPOINT pens may be useful and universal but they are not very
beautiful. The fountain pens which they replaced in the pockets of the
nation are a very different matter indeed however and in the last five
years they have rapidly ascended in value as people have begun
collecting them seriously.
On Friday, Bonhams, the London auction house which claims to have held
the first sale devoted to fountain pens in 1991, is having another of
fine and rare fountain pens and pencils.
There are some treasures on offer, including a 14 carat gold Waterman
model 504 decorated with scrolls and seven flowers, and each flower has
a diamond set in its centre. This pen once belonged to an American
millionaire called ''Diamond Jim'' Brady, who lived around the turn of
the century. Bonhams have put an estimate of between #6000 and #10,000
on his pen.
The figures 504 denote the characteristics of the pen -- 5 means it is
made of gold; 0 means it is filled by a pipette; and 4 is a measure of
its size.
Quite apart from the diamonds and the Brady connection, Watermans,
decorated with metal work by the firm Heath, are among the most
desirable pens to be found. In 1991, Bonhams' pen specialist Alexander
Crum-Ewing would expect to get about #5000 for a gold Waterman. Today
the price can go well above the #16,500 which was what one collector
paid for a silver Waterman snake pen in 1995. If the highly priced pen
had been gold it would have been even more expensive.
It is called snake pen because its body is designed with a snake
curving around it. There are only about five or six silver snake pens
known to have been made, but Bonhams also have a gold plated one in
their forthcoming sale and they are eagerly waiting to see what it
fetches.
Since he first started selling pens, Alexander Crum-Ewing has noticed
that the market has become more sophisticated. In the beginning all
sorts of old fountain pens were eagerly sought after but today,
collectors are more discriminating -- and also prepared to pay more for
what they want.
''There has been a downturn in price for common or damaged pens, but a
huge increase for more rare examples. Altogether writing implements is a
growing area,'' he said.
Among the items he is offering next Friday is a large selection of
''dip'' pens. These pens have a reservoir which has to be regularly
filled up by ''dipping'' in a pot of ink, and they were first invented
by a Frenchman called Bion, who provided writing materials for the
French court from the 1720s until the 1770s. One of the best in Bonhams'
sale is made of gold and mother of pearl and carries an estimate of
around #1800.
Decorative pencils are also very collectible today and one interesting
example to be sold is an ''ever pointed'' pencil, a forerunner of the
modern propelling pencil. It was patented in 1822/3 by Samuel Morden and
John Isaac Hawkins, and Morden's company went on producing propelling
pencils until the Second World War when the factory was bombed and never
re-opened.
A more modern novelty pencil in the shape of a jumping hare is in the
sale with an estimate of around #500.
An interesting pencil holder was found by Crum-Ewing when he was
examining a box of mixed ''objects of virtue'' that had been brought in
for sale. It is really just a pencil shield made of 18 carat gold by a
Georgian craftsman called John Sheldon, and it has a three-inch ruler
marked down one side of it. Its age and rarity mean that it should sell
for around #150.
There is also a strong market for unusual modern pens such as a 1974
Parker which was one of about 10,000 made from brass salvaged from the
old Queen Elizabeth which sunk in Hong Kong harbour. When those pens
were new they sold for #100 but the one which comes up for sale on
Friday should make about #700.
Bonhams are also sponsoring The London Pen Show 1995 which takes place
at the Royal College of Art, Kensington Gore, from tomorrow until
September 10. The show will have collectors' and trade stands,
restoration advice, valuations, demonstrations and even a graphologist.
The main attraction will be an exhibition of 1930 Dunhill Namiki pens,
which were a co-operative production between Alfred Dunhill of London
and the Namiki Manufacturing Company of Japan. These handmade gold pens
are exquisitely beautiful and the lacquer and gold or silver
ornamentation of each one took more than three months to complete.
Anyone with an old, attractive pen, that is not working well or is
damaged, can have it expertly restored by one of several firms which
have started up in the pen restoration business. They include the
Edinburgh Pen Show (0131 226 3624); the Battersea Pen Home (0171 652
4695); or Classic Pens Ltd (01992 524444).

* TAXONOMY is taxing, as zoologists have discovered. It's the
scientific art of classification of animals, and the Australian
Aborigines, who lived in harmony with their environment, gave harmonious
names to their native species. The Victorian naturalists, on the other
hand, reduced everything to the dull, boring, and unwieldy.
What the taxonomists unimaginatively called the large rock rat, the
local folk knew as the djookooropa. The Aborigines were familiar with
the poetically named djintamoonga until the regulators came up with the
inspired ''black-footed tree rat''.
Now there's a campaign in Australia to give the animals their true
names back again, before some of the wonderful Aboriginal descriptions
are lost, and to return much of the charming and descriptive character
to some rare beasts.
Come to think of it, we could do with adding a little character to our
native species by giving them names which more accurately describe their
true characteristics. Our own aboriginals, the Gaels, got it right when
they named the clabby-doo. Roughly translated it means ''big black
mouth'' and if you see one gape in a fishmongers you'll see the
resemblance.
Our midge could do with some aboriginal aptness. Midge doesn't do this
menace justice. How about ''jeezameatenalive'' or ''hoachen-biters''?
A wasp may be waspish but does that really say it all? How about
hunker-jabber, or poisonterior. Seagulls, for their aerial marksmanship,
could be glidersplatters, ducks (in season, of course)
tastiroastiflutters, while pigeons could be cobblepeckindoos.
Cats could be screechallnights, or tweetereaters. Dogs would need
names for every variety. Scots terriers might be nippyheels and mongrels
simply mixenmatchers. Pit bulls should be known as druggiesdugs or
pusherspooches, while rottweilers would only ever be addressed as nice
doggy.
Highland cattle in Pollok Park might be known as hairihornies or maybe
just woolliebullies. Rams would no doubt be buttheads.
The only species which should never change is the rare Edinburgh
matron, catalogued zoologically as furcoata-nickerabsentia of the
sub-order hadyertee. (Related to Kelvinsydia-Westendii.) She will
always, of course, be mutton-dressed-as-lamb.

IT might sound like something from a Terry Pratchett sci-fi, but Disk
Wars have erupted as two global consortia struggle for the domination of
the world CD market. The prize is a huge bite of the entertainment
market.
Sony and Philips are lined up against the SD Alliance, which includes
Japan's electronic giants Toshiba and Matsushita and French-based
Thomson. Each group has produced super-density disk systems which store
data digitally in huge amounts, and could transform the entertainment
business so dramatically that the future of video cassettes might be in
serious jeopardy.
Advances in the new super-density disk mean that each is capable of
storing up to a dozen times more information than CDs can at present,
which gives them more than four hours of broadcast-quality picture on
one neat and easily stored CD.
Each camp believes it has the superior system, although from what
Frontiers can gather, there's not a huge difference between them and
Sony seems to have the development and technical edge. The disks combine
the abilities of video and audio plus the capability to store data for
use on multimedia PCs.
In the race to win a customer base, the SD Alliance has been
negotiating with the Hollywood production giants whose co-operation is
vital when the battle gets to the home entertainment stage.
Major players, including MGM and Time Warner, are reported to be
supporting the SD system but Sony and friends are launching a
counter-offensive backed by Philips' control of Polygram, the music
giant which has branched out into films, and Sony's own subsidiaries
including TriStar and Columbia.
Other major league players including Viacom, one of the giants of the
home video business, and the Walt Disney Corporation are reputedly on
the fence, still to be persuaded.
Whoever wins the battle, if there is a winner -- and there is a
possibility that both conglomerates might work out a deal to save each a
bruising market tussle -- the digital disk will bring about a revolution
in home entertainment.
Nick Thomas, speaking for Philips, says that the Sony team already
have taken the lead as far as the professional and computer industry
areas are concerned.
''More than half the world of floppy-disk and CD-based manufacturers
support this digital disk,'' he says. ''The applications are wide and
very far-reaching. Some computer applications take up to 20 CD-Roms, and
the new technology will allow them to be delivered on only one or two.
Games will have extra speed and capacity which will give players and
developers a huge amount of freedom. Digital disk will being a new
interactive experience, and at the moment we are still at the Wright
Brothers' stage of development. It will only improve in huge leaps from
now.''
Huge storage and neat technology make the system sound attractive. The
CD ports will be smaller than ever because of the red-laser system which
has a much finer beam frequency.
The battle for domination, if the two supergroups don't reach a
marketing and development agreement, will continue for a while yet. The
final launch of either system is still at the planning stage, but both
systems could be in the shops by next summer.
If a deal is not done, and the Hollywood giants line up and split the
development and the market, it's likely that the digital disk will cost
both consortia vast amounts in competitive marketing, but the price will
no doubt be paid by the consumer.
Whatever the result, in just a few years time, chewed tapes and
tracking problems could be a thing of the past. Fast forwarding could
take mere seconds as the laser beam automatically changes from one track
to another. Having tested the Philips CD-i 450, which does not operate
on digital disk, the television picture, both in films and games was
still impressive.
Already the CD-i makers have extensive and growing lists of available
movies, plus music video-audi, stacks of games and picture and reference
libraries. The Philips version is selling for under #300. It's believed
the consortia are hoping to keep the prices as low as possible when the
new technology is available next year. Giving disks five times the
storage will further transform the home entertainments business. One
disc for a Kevin Costner movie?
* A TINY electronic scanner could knock the burgeoning cash forgery
business for six. Developed by Mars Electronics International, it's a
new counterfeit detector which can spot a fake in microseconds.
Because of advances in photocopying and other printing techniques,
huge numbers of counterfeit notes have flooded the market. While there
are no official statistics, it is believed that as much as #150m in fake
money is in circulation. Some of the notes are so good that they fool
bank staff and have been issued from high street cash dispensers.
The Mars system is a compact and discreet scanner that can be tuned to
any currency, including all of the Scottish banknotes.
To use the Cashguard detector a shop assistant, barman, or salesman
inserts the note into a slot where it is scanned by a light detector
which passes the data to a microprocessor which in turn compares it with
a ''footprint'' data library compiled from street-quality notes. If the
money meets all the parameters, the machine shows a green light.
If the note is suspect, the light is red and a loud bleep sounds.
Stewart McDougall of Mars Electronics says that in trials more than
4000 counterfeits were fed into the machine and all were detected.
McDougall says: ''The retailer faces three problems when he finds he
has been given a fake note. He must by law take it to a police station
and won't get compensation; he has lost the goods which have been sold;
and he has most likely given his own money away as change in the
transaction. The chances are that he will lose a lot more than the face
value of the note he has accepted.''
The new Cashguard machine, which has been tried out in banks, pubs,
service stations, and markets, is on sale for #249. Mars says that its
detection rate of 99.5% of current counterfeits means that if it gives a
red light on only eight occasions, it will pay for itself.
And it will save that embarrassing moment when the barman holds the
drinking voucher up to the light . . . and sorrowfully shakes his head.

* JVC believe they have made a breakthrough in recordable CD software
in their Extensions development which allows the PC user to use a CD-R
drive like a floppy drive. With a CD-R gold disk with 600 Mb capacity
the user can work in Windows and use copy edit and delete function.
Files can also be renamed and directories restructured. JVC say this is
recordable CD for the man in the street and gives users 600 meg of
storage on a #6 disk.
The #199 software bundles with the JVC double-speed CDR and player for
#1395.
The downside is that the CD-R discs are not re-writable. The upside,
say the makers, is that they are non-erasable. Data will be secure,
short of destroying the disk.

IT might sound like something from a Terry Pratchett sci-fi, but Disk
Wars have erupted as two global consortia struggle for the domination of
the world CD market. The prize is a huge bite of the entertainment
market.
Sony and Philips are lined up against the SD Alliance, which includes
Japan's electronic giants Toshiba and Matsushita and French-based
Thomson. Each group has produced super-density disk systems which store
data digitally in huge amounts, and could transform the entertainment
business so dramatically that the future of video cassettes might be in
serious jeopardy.
Advances in the new super-density disk mean that each is capable of
storing up to a dozen times more information than CDs can at present,
which gives them more than four hours of broadcast-quality picture on
one neat and easily stored CD.
Each camp believes it has the superior system, although from what
Frontiers can gather, there's not a huge difference between them and
Sony seems to have the development and technical edge. The disks combine
the abilities of video and audio plus the capability to store data for
use on multimedia PCs.
In the race to win a customer base, the SD Alliance has been
negotiating with the Hollywood production giants whose co-operation is
vital when the battle gets to the home entertainment stage.
Major players, including MGM and Time Warner, are reported to be
supporting the SD system but Sony and friends are launching a
counter-offensive backed by Philips' control of Polygram, the music
giant which has branched out into films, and Sony's own subsidiaries
including TriStar and Columbia.
Other major league players including Viacom, one of the giants of the
home video business, and the Walt Disney Corporation are reputedly on
the fence, still to be persuaded.
Whoever wins the battle, if there is a winner -- and there is a
possibility that both conglomerates might work out a deal to save each a
bruising market tussle -- the digital disk will bring about a revolution
in home entertainment.
Nick Thomas, speaking for Philips, says that the Sony team already
have taken the lead as far as the professional and computer industry
areas are concerned.
''More than half the world of floppy-disk and CD-based manufacturers
support this digital disk,'' he says. ''The applications are wide and
very far-reaching. Some computer applications take up to 20 CD-Roms, and
the new technology will allow them to be delivered on only one or two.
Games will have extra speed and capacity which will give players and
developers a huge amount of freedom. Digital disk will being a new
interactive experience, and at the moment we are still at the Wright
Brothers' stage of development. It will only improve in huge leaps from
now.''
Huge storage and neat technology make the system sound attractive. The
CD ports will be smaller than ever because of the red-laser system which
has a much finer beam frequency.
The battle for domination, if the two supergroups don't reach a
marketing and development agreement, will continue for a while yet. The
final launch of either system is still at the planning stage, but both
systems could be in the shops by next summer.
If a deal is not done, and the Hollywood giants line up and split the
development and the market, it's likely that the digital disk will cost
both consortia vast amounts in competitive marketing, but the price will
no doubt be paid by the consumer.
Whatever the result, in just a few years time, chewed tapes and
tracking problems could be a thing of the past. Fast forwarding could
take mere seconds as the laser beam automatically changes from one track
to another. Having tested the Philips CD-i 450, which does not operate
on digital disk, the television picture, both in films and games was
still impressive.
Already the CD-i makers have extensive and growing lists of available
movies, plus music video-audi, stacks of games and picture and reference
libraries. The Philips version is selling for under #300. It's believed
the consortia are hoping to keep the prices as low as possible when the
new technology is available next year. Giving disks five times the
storage will further transform the home entertainments business. One
disc for a Kevin Costner movie?
* A TINY electronic scanner could knock the burgeoning cash forgery
business for six. Developed by Mars Electronics International, it's a
new counterfeit detector which can spot a fake in microseconds.
Because of advances in photocopying and other printing techniques,
huge numbers of counterfeit notes have flooded the market. While there
are no official statistics, it is believed that as much as #150m in fake
money is in circulation. Some of the notes are so good that they fool
bank staff and have been issued from high street cash dispensers.
The Mars system is a compact and discreet scanner that can be tuned to
any currency, including all of the Scottish banknotes.
To use the Cashguard detector a shop assistant, barman, or salesman
inserts the note into a slot where it is scanned by a light detector
which passes the data to a microprocessor which in turn compares it with
a ''footprint'' data library compiled from street-quality notes. If the
money meets all the parameters, the machine shows a green light.
If the note is suspect, the light is red and a loud bleep sounds.
Stewart McDougall of Mars Electronics says that in trials more than
4000 counterfeits were fed into the machine and all were detected.
McDougall says: ''The retailer faces three problems when he finds he
has been given a fake note. He must by law take it to a police station
and won't get compensation; he has lost the goods which have been sold;
and he has most likely given his own money away as change in the
transaction. The chances are that he will lose a lot more than the face
value of the note he has accepted.''
The new Cashguard machine, which has been tried out in banks, pubs,
service stations, and markets, is on sale for #249. Mars says that its
detection rate of 99.5% of current counterfeits means that if it gives a
red light on only eight occasions, it will pay for itself.
And it will save that embarrassing moment when the barman holds the
drinking voucher up to the light . . . and sorrowfully shakes his head.

THE strains of Deep Purple played in tandem by tenor saxophonists
Scott Hamilton and Ken Peplowski, backed by a world-class rhythm
section, ended the Nairn Jazz Festival for another year.
Their rendition was unabashedly romantic, similar to the feelings
which under-pinned the festival itself. For the near week-long jazz bash
organised with some tender loving care by Ken Ramage had more than a few
of us close to tears at different times.
This was a celebration of the best in jazz. Of the rhythmic. Of the
poetic. Of the historic. Of the eclectic. And, above all, as I said
about the closing number, about the romantic.
In many ways the Ramage gigs I attended -- and there were five of
these at the end of his jazz week -- reminded me of the days in the
sixties when I travelled south to listen to Red Allen and Pee Wee
Russell and Ruby Braff at the old Manchester Sports' Guild.
The organiser there was the formidable L C Jenkins and it was largely
down to him and his advisers that the concept of bringing in star
soloists from the United States was developed.
Ramage is a worthy successor to the Jenks' ideal. And, as that last
glorious number was still being savoured the promoter was telling me
that the Festival, with similar star personnel would take place again
next year.
He had been delighted with the musical success of the whole event. The
standards were high. The programming was superb. And the chosen tunes
ran the gamut of jazz history as well as delving deeply into the
American Popular Song Book.
The men involved spoke the same language even though veteran piano
giant Raplh Sutton might have been making his first recordings before
either guitarist Howard Alden or reedmen Hamilton and Peplowski were
born.
It was beautiful to see the deference they paid Sutton and the
admiration they showed for his playing on the two nights he was
involved.
Sutton has long paid his dues. Discovered by trombonist Jack
Teagarden, intermission piano player at Eddie Condon's New York club for
almost a decade and then a charter member of the World's Greatest Jazz
Band, Sutton now knows no peer as a stride piano player.
So much for the historic . . ..
Then there were the various duo moments for Alden and Peplowski, often
on clarinet more than tenor, and perhaps it is on the former horn he
will eventually find greatness.
For me, their finest moment came with another of The Lion's delicate
and wistful pieces, Fading Star. It was a tune I could not recall though
Alden chidingly told me I would have it on record at home. He was right.
The composer recorded it just once, for the Commodore label in l939 and
I do have it and I have since played it along with the Dynamic Duo's
latest recording of it on Concord which has just been issued.
So much for the eclectic . . .
There was a version of Ellington's Ring Dem Bells kicked into life by
drummer Jake Hanna which didn't seem as if it would ever stop until it
struck the buffers and produced some of the fastest most exciting
clarinet from Peplowski that I have ever heard.
So much for the rhythmic . . . .
Howard Alden, a genius of the guitar, joined Moore in some exquisite
duets and paid an inevitable tribute to Django Reinhardt with Tears.
So much for the poetic . . .
Then in the closing session we had Scott Hamilton featuring himself on
the old Billie Holiday number My Old Flame and proving that real jazz
feeling will never die as long as he keeps the flame . . .
So much for the romantic . . .
Now it will be on to next year with some little diversions along way
from the tireless and tastful Mr Ramage. My only hope is that some of
the sessions have been recorded. Or that they will be in future. Each
set contained gems which were memorable, music which was beautiful, and
musicianship which could not be bettered.

ome Of These Were Hooj Two, various (Hooj Toons)
* HOOJ? More like flumping gi-normous, matey. Two-CD presentation of
the Hooj imprint's hottest happy-house hits, including the current top
10 smash Son Of A Gun by JX and Sister Bliss's recent stonker Can't Get
A Man, Can't Get A Job (Life's A Bitch).
One CD gives you a delicious dozen belters in traditional
segmented-track form; the second CD provides the same tunes in a
continuous DJ mix with which you can happily house-up your living room.
The Very Best of Orange Juice, Orange Juice (Polydor)
* A STICKER on the sleeve underlines this collection's
nakedly-commercial raison d'etre: ''Featuring Edwyn Collins''. This
22-track collection, first assembled in 1992, is designed to ensnare
those who have only recently been converted to the lugubrious tones of
our own Sir Edwyn, a recent worldwide hitster with the wondrous A Girl
Like You. Informed, elderly groovers like you and me will already have
every glorious song on this album by Edwyn's long-deceased first combo,
of course. From Falling And Laughing way back when in 1981 to Lean
Period and What Presence?! in 1984. Jings, what a treat lies in store
for new bugs. Buy now, in conjunction with Edwyn's current Gorgeous
George opus.
The Rough And The Smooth, Outside (Dorado)
* CONFIRMATION that the coolest dancefloor-cats live in a funkified,
jungled-up, jazz-fuelled world. Matt Cooper is Outside's motivating
force, assisted here by such instrumental luminaries as Cleveland
Watkiss, Byron Wallen, Greg Osby and Tony Remy. Delete Tricky and
Massive Attack from your list of crucial groovers. This album, along
with those by Earthling (Radar) and D*Note (Criminal Justice), tells you
all you need to know about music's braver directions in 1995.
It's Great When You're Straight . . . Yeah!; Black Grape (Radioactive)
* AS to this album's ever-lasting worth in th'ole rock continuum, I
know not. I do know, however, that Mr Ryder and his trip-lope pranksters
have succeeded in creating something which captures precisely the
prevailing mood of the moment: can't be arsed. Folk who can't think
creating music for folk who can't be bothered to think. Don't think;
enjoy.
DAVID BELCHER
For the Record, JSD Band (Village Music)
* AFTER a 20-year sabbatical Scotland's prototype folk rockers return
with 14 re-recorded favourites from their stomping heyday, their Celtic,
Bluegrass and Cajun mix sounding slightly more grizzled but less
frenzied. Chuck Fleming's expressive fiddling makes a particularly
welcome return, although it will be interesting to see if, now the
sleeping dogs are awake, what new tricks they can learn.
Fine Flowers &amp; Foolish Glances, Mick West (Lochshore)
* A HIGHLY creditable debut from Glasgow-born singer and bodhran
player West, whose calm, assured and natural singing of mostly
traditional songs is supported by imaginative arrangements and some
excellent playing, particularly from guitarist Tony McManus and pianist
Brian Byrne on Chester City's syncopated swagger.
ROB ADAMS
Louis Armstrong's 50 Hot Choruses for Cornet (Volumes 3-4), Bent
Persson (Kenneth)
* A STORY goes with this one: in 1927 Louis Armstrong recorded a
collection of choruses which were then transcribed and published as
sheet music. The cylinders on which the solos were recorded are long
lost and he never incorporated them into his own recordings; indeed he
never recorded most of the tunes for which they were intended. In the
1970s, ace Swedish cornettist Bent Persson, recently heard at the
Edinburgh International Jazz Festival, started a project to put the
solos into their intended contexts -- the full tunes and varying sizes
of bands. These latest 18 tracks form the final volume of a superb
collection, on which Persson and British pianist Keith Nicholls excel.
Especially on a selection of Jelly Roll Morton numbers.

I REMEMBER walking down Argyll Street, in a Henry VIII fake fur, a
colossal item, with heavy, bell-shaped sleeves. I still have it. It's a
pale, beige, minky grey, and looks as if it's been made out of the same
material as teddy bears. Anyway, a large stall of animal rights
protesters, the hippy kind, had set up camp, playing tapes of beagles on
the hunt for the fox. And as I walked past, I remember that one of them,
a boy of about 18, stared at me as if I was the enemy. He was a few
yards away, and probably thought I was wearing a real fur. Or, more
correctly, he didn't have the suss to realise that just because you wear
fake fur, doesn't mean you want to wear the real thing, but just can't
afford it. Again, this season, fake fur returns. The anti-fur brigade
may do well to remember, that they are not meant to be an imitation of
dead animal skins anymore, just fun.
C&amp;A Fake Fur Jackets start at #29.99 for snow-tipped grey and white
bomber jacket, #45 for the iced-cream shaggy jacket, and #79.99 for the
long version.

The traitor Monteith dies under a hundred swords . . . So perish the
murderers of William Wallace
SIR William Wallace was not hanged, drawn, and quartered by the
English. He did die on their scaffold in August 1305, but he was at
Bannockburn nine years later. Despite what the history books say, the
Scots under him won the Battle of Falkirk in 1298. And Wallace knocked
sparks off the helmet of Edward I, Hammer of the Scots, with his
claymore in a hand-to-hand clash.
Quite a guy, Mel Gibson would say. Talking of Mel Gibson -- he's got
it wrong when he has Wallace bedding the Hammer's daughter-in-law,
Princess Isabelle, and fathering a potential Mad Mac 2 by her. If anyone
in England's royal household was going to be jumping into a four-poster
with Scotland's greatest hero, it was Edward's queen. She took a right
fancy to the blue-eyed Wallace when he posed as a wandering minstrel and
taught her how to pluck the harp in her Durham apartment.
Not a lot of people know these things. Scots historians who have
devoted decades to scraping together the little that is known of Wallace
don't know them. Presumably, Braveheart's scriptwriter didn't know about
them either; or else he resisted the temptation to take too many
liberties with the life and times of the man whose name is synonymous
with liberty.
Reportedly, the scriptwriter, American Randall Wallace, has referred
to the epic poem The Wallace, by Blind Harry, written in the late
fifteenth century, which historians dismiss as a legitimate source.
Whatever his sources, by all accounts he is in for a verbal hanging,
drawing, and quartering from those historians and others ready to shoot
down what they suspect will prove to be a Hollywood hijacking job on the
undebunked symbol of Scottish nationhood.
If, after the European premiere of Braveheart in Stirling, that does
indeed turn out to be the verdict, scriptwriter Wallace, however, will
at least be able to plead that he was not the first to tinker with the
historical Wallace -- not by a long shot. He was beaten to it by almost
200 years, and by an Englishwoman.
Jane Porter wrote of those things that others do not know about
Wallace and his times early last century, achieving -- long before the
art of screenwriting was required -- that international exposure of
Wallace's heroic story now sought by Gibson and his scriptwriter.
Her romance, The Scottish Chiefs, was first published in 1810. It was
translated into German and Russian, and would no doubt have been widely
read in France but for the strange fact that a French version was banned
by Napoleon. Its earnings must have been minuscule in comparison with
the multi-millions predicted for Braveheart, but still must have meant a
tidy sum for the authoress. Her book's popularity demanded that it be
reprinted nine times.
You won't find it in your favourite bookshop today or in many public
libraries. I first laid hands on my copy in the mid-1950s and haven't
seen another since. So it does no harm to expand on Jane Porter's
treatment of her subject, remembering that she was a childhood friend of
Sir Walter Scott, who is credited with being partly responsible for
stimulating her imagination with tales based on Scottish legends.
One of the things that Jane Porter knew about Wallace, and which
historians don't, and which has not been mentioned already, is that the
hero married twice. And with no apology from her to Elderslie, which
lays claim to Wallace, she placed him in Ellerslie, where the first of
his wives, Marion Braidfoot, and their unborn child, are slain by the
Hammer's governor in Lanark, Heselrigge. The assassin is seeking revenge
on Wallace for the killing of his nephew -- who had asked for it, of
course -- and is also desperate to get his hands on a ''mysterious box''
with which Wallace has been entrusted. The box is to be opened only by
''the man by whose valour God restores her (Scotland's) rights''.
Only on the final, 350th page is the secret of the box revealed, and
much blood is spilled before that. Wallace doesn't take long to catch up
with Heselrigge. He despatches him with the varlet's own sword, still
red with Marion's blood.
Porter's Wallace goes on to trample on toes on which his social
betters, the higher Scottish nobility, fear to tread, rescuing among
others the loyal Earl of Mar, his fair daughter, Helen, and her
stepmother, the Countess, from the clutches of the Southrons. His deeds
are many and in accord with the code of chivalry. He does not subscribe
to the motto that the only good Englishman is a dead Englishman and wins
the respect of several of Edward's captains.
Sadly, there is no lack of base and foul Scottish aristocrats, jealous
of the success of this upstart who shows many of them up as landgrabbers
who'll bend the knee to anyone prepared to further their careers. They
and the Countess of Mar, whose illicit passion for him Wallace declines,
remaining true to her Earl, are his eventual undoing.
But Porter's Robert the Bruce is not in the baddies' ranks against
Wallace as the historians say -- at least not from halfway through the
Battle of Falkirk onwards. His father does a lot of damage against the
Scots on the field, but the future king -- ''habited in a white
hacqueton, wrought with gold, with golden sandals on his feet and a
helmet of the same metal on his head, crested with white feathers'' --
meets up with Wallace during a pause in the conflict. He offers Wallace
''my heart, my life, to wash out by your side, in the blood of the
enemies of Scotland, the stigma which now dishonours the name of
Bruce''. The two lay about the English -- and the traitor Scots among
them -- to scatter them and an Edward wounded at the hand of Wallace
from the battlefield on the banks of the Carron. The young Bruce then
goes off to persuade his father that he, too, should be standing by
Wallace against the Hammer.
The gallant pair next meet at Durham, where, in true Robin Hood style,
Wallace enters the English lion's den disguised as a minstrel on a
mission to rescue the captured Helen Mar, gets the big eye from the
Queen under Edward's nose -- and a secret note from her promising that
he would find her ''an indulgent mistress''. A further note from her,
inviting him to her quarters ''at the last vespers tonight'' falls into
Edward's hands, and it looks as if Wallace's cover is about to be blown.
However, he escapes by a secret passage, gallantly leaving a note
swearing that there had been no cuckoldry, and heads for France, to
where Helen Mar has already been spirited by a really evil Southron, a
Sheriff of Nottingham type. Rescuing the heir to the French throne from
a pirate en route, Wallace amazingly meets up again with the young
Bruce. Not only that, they bump into the exiled Scots puppet king, John
Balliol, who resigns his kingdom to Bruce with the confession: ''I
bartered the liberties of my country for a crown I knew not how to
wear.''
Balliol redeems himself by assisting in the rescue of Helen Mar, and
Wallace returns to Scotland to repel the English invaders once more
until his betrayal by Sir John Monteith sees him hauled south to defy
Edward's accusation that he is a traitor and face execution.
This is where Wallace and Helen Mar reveal their true feelings for
each other and are allowed to wed. But the Southron sense of chivalry
does not allow a honeymoon for our hero and his bride. Jane Porter omits
the drawing and quartering bits from Edward's sentence, but her Wallace
must still face the rope.
However, as the hangman goes to throw the noose around her groom's
brave neck, Helen throwns herself upon the victim. But Wallace cheats
the Hammer. Porter has him tell Helen: ''We shall next meet to part no
more. May God preserve my country and . . . '' He dies on the spot in
mid-sentence, locked in Helen's arms.
What a script, but there is more. Jane Porter does not let the
executioner disembowel and hack apart her hero's corpse. Perhaps she did
not want to admit that her countrymen would commit the atrocity. Or was
it simply that she had more in mind for Wallace -- a final chapter that
a Hollywood mogul would drool over?
Omitting to mention the nine years between Wallace's death and
Bannockburn, Porter races on to Scotland's finest hour, placing what
Bruce describes as ''that Heaven-sent palladium of our freedom'' --
Wallace's bier, with the royal standard waving over his ''sacred head''
-- in prominence as inspiration for the freedom-fighters.
Now's the day and now's the hour. The battle is won. The traitor
Monteith dies ''under a hundred swords'' and the cry is: ''So perish the
murderers of William Wallace!''
But Wallace has still to play his final scene. Bruce and Helen's
sister, Isabella, are married in the presence of the revered corpse in
nearby Cambuskenneth Abbey. Actually, experts place Bruce's marriage to
the Mar lady a few years before Wallace's death and his second, to
Elizabeth de Burgh, in 1302. But forget the nit-picking. Bruce kisses
the hand that wielded the sword of freedom for Scotland and the tragic
Helen, pining for her lost love, throws herself on the coffin.
The Abbot of Inchaffray then decides that it is time to open ''the
mysterious box'', the contents of which were intended for the restorer
of Scotland's rights. His action reveals the Scottish regalia -- and
Bruce is crowned with the diadem.
If Jane Porter had been writing for the camera, it would then have
panned from Bruce's crowned head back to the prostrate Helen, whose soul
is found to have fled to join Wallace's.
We'll just have to wait and see if Mel Gibson and Randall Wallace can
beat all that.

THE image of the Scottish warrior is being kept alive and portrayed
throughout the world on films and television by a Glasgow-based
community group dedicated to the martial arts and the return of the clan
system. Its members, who are called upon regularly to advise,
choreograph and take part in historic battle scenes, were described by
one film producer as ''the most competent, professional and dedicated
close-combat crew'' with whom he had ever worked.
Before deciding to go ahead with Braveheart, the Australian megastar
Mel Gibson sought their advice and spent a week with them, incognito,
living in a tenement in Pollokshields.
They are part of the Wallace Clan Trust, a community-action project
with premises under the Kingston Bridge, which offers unemployed people
the opportunity to learn skills including historical research and
training in all aspects of the film and television industry.
Involvement in Braveheart gave the ''fighting men'' of the Wallace
Clan international recognition, but they have been appearing in films
and on TV for almost 10 years.
It all started during the filming of Highlander in Glencoe when a
group of security men employed on the set were engaged as fighting
extras. Over the years it has developed into a self-contained film
production unit specialising in Scottish history, with its own technical
crews, and its own wardrobe and weaponry based on those of medieval,
Renaissance and Jacobite times.
The trust was set up as a charity in 1986 by Seoras Wallace, a free
spirit from Galloway, whose intention is to bring back clanship to
Scotland and secure an area of land which the Wallace Clan can call its
own, while at the same time honouring its ancestors and creating a
tourist attraction. Working on films, although coincidental to the main
purpose of the trust, is vital in providing funds.
Small in stature but wiry and as tough as nails, Wallace sees himself
as a fighter and fight arranger rather than an actor or film extra. He
planned the battle scenes at Culloden in Chasing the Deer, the film
financed by public subscription. Producer Bob Carruthers was so
impressed he dedicated it to Wallace and his crew.
Wallace'stwo passions -- Scottish history and martial arts -- led him
to form the Scottish Clan Battle Society and to his first film part. On
a visit to Glencoe in 1985 he met Andy Broadford, one of the production
crew of Highlander.
Soon afterwards he was in front of the cameras playing a fight extra,
alongside Sean Connery, Christopher Lambert and James Cosmo, and made
more money in four weeks than he ever thought possible. ''It happened
because I complained about the lack of Scots in the film. We in security
-- all Scots -- were having to watch a bunch of South Africans, New
Zealanders and Germans playing Scots and not doing it right. We gave a
demonstration of our fighting capabilities and were hired for the battle
scenes.''
The experience made him realise there was a future in films,
advertising and tourism for someone like himself to demonstrate and
represent accurately the fighting styles of the Scottish warrior. Since
1990 it has been an educational training centre. Many of the trainees
have become involved in the administration of the trust and its films
and television work, while others have returned to more permanent forms
of employment.
Members were employed on Lorna Doone, The Big Man and Silent Scream,
always as fighters or bruisers.
Rapidly the trust became a production unit offering a complete service
ranging from extras and technicians to period costumes and Scottish
weapons. Wallace explained: ''From early on when I worked on Highlander
I realised it was not only people that were required but the costumes of
the period. I decided to set up a wardrobe department and make the
costumes rather than buy them. The materials came mainly from Paddy's
Market in Glasgow.''
It was the same with weaponry. ''We built up our armoury through trial
and error. We used everything from old Land Rover springs to properly
tempered steel. It's been a long haul, but now we have every type of
sword wielded by the Scots throughout history.''
The trust has also received as gifts some valuable fifteenth and
sixteenth-century weapons from other countries. Such is its collection
of ancient and traditional weapons it is now looking at the possibility
of establishing a museum in Glasgow based on the Scottish warrior and
the ''more unusual and macabre aspects of Scottish history''.
Braveheart is the biggest film the Wallace Clan Trust has been
involved in. An American, Randall Wallace, who had written a script on
The Wallace sought its advice in December 1993. He then approached Mel
Gibson, who flew to Glasgow to meet Seoras and other members of the
Wallace Clan. He stayed with them for about a week and met all the staff
at Kingston. ''We honoured his privacy and kept his presence in Glasgow
a secret for most of the time he was here.''
Wallace worked throughout the film both in Scotland and when it moved
to Wicklow in Ireland. On location in Fort William he played one of the
Wallace villagers and in Ireland he reverted to his familiar role as
fight arranger and consultant.
Despite the success and the future work that involvement with
Braveheart and Gibson is bound to bring, Wallace still maintains that
filming is principally a tool for raising money towards acquiring clan
lands some time in the future. He is proud, however, that members of the
Scottish film industry establishment can no longer turn up their noses
and dismiss the Wallace Clan Trust as being of no significance.
''We have worked with Bob Carruthers who had the courage to make
Chasing the Deer and the investors who had the courage to put in their
money. In Braveheart we worked on one of the most expensive films ever
to come of Scotland (total estimated budget $120m).
''The structure was the same, the passion was the same, but for the
Wallace Clan point of view we have told the story of the first fight for
independence to the last battle on Scottish soil. So in a sense our
vocation has been fulfilled.''

* IT IS said that many women are not wearing the best bra for their
needs. That there are many brands and types, but little expertise in
what one to choose and how to wear one.
The right bra is of so much importance, it's being given much the same
press as smear tests. The smear test is a necessary embarrassment to
catch disease at its earliest and curable stages, the bra measurement
service a necessary embarrassment too, in order to avoid sagging and
unsightly lines.
House of Fraser seek to remedy the numbers of women walking around
ignorant of how their bra is affecting their posture and wellbeing. You

* PEOPLE who wear hats are allegedly eccentric and showy. Gone are the
days when a hat meant etiquette, not ego. The truth is, hats flatter
women. They have a brutal femininity. Any outfit suddenly becomes
stylish, dignified and intimidating with a hat. A hat which will suit
any woman, however, is difficult to design. Student milliners from all
over the country are being invited to gatecrash the mainstream by
entering the first ever ''Hennessy Cognac Millinery Competition''.
Hennessy are looking for exciting and stylish hats designs suitable
for this year's winter season, in particular -- the prestigious Hennessy
Gold Cup race meeting at Newbury on November 25. The winner will be
presented with a #500 cheque and a case of Hennessy cognac.
Hats must be ready to present before a panel of leading judges in
October. Twelve students will then be chosen as finalists and invited to
Newbury where their designs will be modelled, probably in front of
royalty. Students wishing to enter should apply for an entry form by
September 8 from: Hennessy Millinery Competition, Chelsea Chambers, 262a
Fulham Road, London SW10 9EL. Don't forget to enclose your name and

Archie McPherson, sports commentator and TV quizmaster, tells ANN
DONALD why his nightly reading matter is a world away from his daytime
career.
* THE reading that I do is as remote from my work with UEFA and
European sports broadcasting as the earth is from planet Jupiter.
I've always been an avid reader of all types of books but this summer
I read two wonderful American books from very different periods in time
and covering very different styles of American life.
The first one is The Collected Short Stories of John Cheever. He
formed part of the New England wit group alongside Thurber and De Vries.
He was very cynical and bitter -- a bit like myself -- and as a writer
he looked at the worlds of the nouveau riche and sophisticates of New
York and the twisted lives of the people who inhabited these worlds.
His stories can be depressing but fascinating at the same time and
give a brilliant insight into American society.
It turned out after his death that his bitterness was in part due to
his double life. He was a drunkard who beat his wife and who also, it
later emerged, was a homosexual who picked up young boys in the toilets
in Grand Central Station.
The other book is by Larry McMurty, who is of Scottish origin, and
it's called Lonesome Dove. It won the Pulitzer prize and I think the BBC
made it into a drama series. I saw it in a bookstore in Paris and
thought, ''Och I'll try that''.
It is quite a magnificent book of the western genre though far removed
from the Zane Grey type books. It's about the pioneering society and
follows a group of cowboy bachelors who band together, raid Mexico to
get cattle and take them to sell to Montana. That's the basis of it but
it's a wonderful examination of the American pioneer and a fine
sweeping, epic novel.
I think that the hard-boiled American writers like Cheever, De Vries,
Steinbeck and Hemingway are my favourites overall.

GEOFF TANSEY has just been on a camping holiday with his family in the
New Forest. Cooking on one gas burner and with nowhere to keep food
cool, it's been a salutary experience of coping without the help of
modern technology. Do we or don't we need it? This is an issue
investigated by him, and co-author Tony Worsley, in The Food System, a
comprehensive overview of why and how the world feeds itself the way it
does.
Take away the technology of the last 50 years and life becomes a tad
more difficult. Freezerless and microwaveless, cooking from scratch
means a lot more time and energy spent buying and preparing food. Today,
suggests Tansey, we're at a crossroads, between tradition and
technology.
From a rich fund of academic knowledge and personal experience, Tansey
and Worsley have compiled a revealing insight into the modern food
chain. While Tansey studied soil science and the history of science
technology, Worsley is a psychologist. Tansey was the founder editor of
the journal Food Policy and is now Visiting Research Fellow at the
University of Bradford; Worsley was Professor of Social Nutrition and
Community Studies at the University of Otago and now heads a Food Policy
Research Unit in Australia.
On how we deal with the future, they suggest that either we continue
to abandon traditional cooking skills, or they are preserved in some
form which makes practical sense.
The fact that many more women today return to paid work outside the
home within a few years of childbirth, yet continue to feed, clothe, and
comfort their children, has created remarkable opportunities for the
food industry. The low participation of men in domestic work has also
contributed to the rise of the microwave and the cook-chill meal. If
this continues, then technological cooking fixes seem set for a bright
future.
As parents cease to turn basic ingredients into meals, and as cooking
skills drop out of the schools' curricula, a new generation is emerging
without the basic knowledge and cooking skills needed to be able to use
fresh, unprocessed foods and turn them into meals. The consequences of
lost cooking skills, and lack of food knowledge, are a concern found in
varying degrees across Europe.
France has introduced its annual Day of Taste, when chefs go to school
to teach young children the joy of distinguishing different tastes. In
Britain, more than 170 organisations, including the Ministry of
Agriculture, Food, and Fisheries and the Department of Health, launched
a ''Get Cooking'' project in 1993, aimed at increasing children's
cooking skills. A survey of seven-to-15-year-olds found that while only
40% could cook a jacket potato in the oven, 90% could play a computer
game.
Tradition or technology, which will it be? If hellbent on abandoning
cooking from scratch, time and energy will certainly be saved in the
kitchen. But what about the state of our scientific knowledge and
consumer awareness? As technology develops, foods of the future are
likely to get much more complicated and the opportunities to mislead the
consumer will inevitably increase.
Who knows the difference between a ''novel'', a ''nutriceutical'', and
a ''functional'' food? Bioengineering is responsible for such novel
foods as the tomato which has four chambers instead of three. Novel
foods can be just about anything new, with or without health properties,
while nutriceuticals are not technically a food but an ingredient in a
food which has a therapeutic application such as vitamins, minerals, and
antioxidants.
Functional foods, on the other hand, are the ones most likely to cause
confusion since they openly offer a health benefit.
Suggesting that carrots are good for seeing in the dark, makes a
functional food claim. Originally this was done by folklore, but now the
lure of niche marketing has encouraged food companies to develop foods
with added ingredients and specific health claims.
Though they still face resistance from legislation in many countries,
a salad dressing might well contain an anti-cholesterol agent; a bread
some polyunsaturated fatty acids for heart disease.
In Japan -- world leader in functional foods -- sales have gone from
zero in 1987 to around US$2 billion in 1992. The US National Cancer
Institute is currently spending around $20m on developing
cancer-preventive foods which will incorporate naturally occurring
compounds from fruits, liquorice, and vegetables.
The irony is that functional foods with health claims are finding a
market in affluent countries where diets tend to contain more
dietary-related diseases caused by high sugar and high animal-fats
diets. Nutritional content of food is another area, suggests Tansey,
where consumers in the future will have to be much more aware of what's
going on.
The real health risk in our food supply is not from things like
pesticides and food poisoning, but from bad nutrition. It can be a real
problem eating a balanced diet if you are not aware of how many
spoonfuls of sugar have gone into a can of Coke.

A Genius for Living
Janet Byrne
Bloomsbury, #20
FRIEDA von Richtofen was born on August 11, 1879. That was in the
French city of Metz. The von Richtofens were there with the occupying
Prussian army. Frieda's father, a Prussian baron, was a civil engineer
whose work was vital to the Germanic forces. The baron's passions were
horticulture, gambling, and reading. He particularly liked to read
history.
The baroness enjoyed reading, too. She could often be found reading
French novels. We are told that she had much in common with Emma Bovary.
This is probably true - and true of her daughter as well. A Genius for
Living, Janet Byrne's portrayal of Frieda, leaves the reader thinking of
Flaubert's most famous creation.
For example, when Frieda was quite young her guinea pigs died during
an early frost; she tried to revive them in an oven. Slightly older,
Frieda became preoccupied with bettering herself. She married Ernest
Weekly, a lecturer at Nottingham University who would help her through
the classics.
When she left Ernest it was for a coal miner's son, David Herbert
Lawrence. He became a famous novelist, and they married.
Eventually she would have a third husband. Of course, she also had
many affairs.
It would have been gratifying if Byrne gave more information on Otto
Gross, one of Frieda's lovers. He is fascinating; fascinatingly
horrible, actually. A libidinous, drug-addicted psycho-analyst: 10 or so
pages on him can never be enough.
Of course, there is plenty of material on D H Lawrence here. He is the
big name, and for that reason this is the biography of Frieda Lawrence
and not Frieda Ravagli: the name she died with.
In any case, Lawrence is vital to the book. He was a terrible husband
and he makes Frieda (who can be pretty terrible herself) appear almost
angelic, sometimes. This is certainly part of the book's aim. Frieda
often appears innocent where she was more than probably guilty.
The book's subject, apparently, had a genius for living. Well, that is
for the reader to decide. As for Byrne, well, she has a flair for
writing and a great capacity for entertaining. Byrne has a real gift for
psychological insight. Her first biography comes warmly recommended.

JOHN EHRMAN: The Rise of Neoconservatism
Intellectuals and foreign affairs 1945-1994
Yale University Press #25
THIS book is most revealing of American ways in the big wide world, it
not perhaps quite in the fashion that John Ehrman intended. He is
himself a member of what they call in Washington the ''foreign policy
community'' and he deals here with one highly-influential faction of it.
These neoconservatives number in their ranks some of the few of such
specialists to enjoy any sort of reputation abroad, Norman Podhoretz,
former editor of the journal Commentary, Jean Kirkpatrick, sometime US
ambassador to the United Nations, and Senator Daniel Moynihan of New
York.
What is distinct about them is that they have worked out a set of
positions on America's international relations which is relatively
coherent and relatively ideological, which therefore makes them
relatively independent of domestic political allegiances.
In its attitudes towards the outside world, to which it is basically
indifferent, their great republic has always shown a confusion of mind.
Especially since it became an imperial power after 1945, it has been
unable to decide whether to be a liberal or conservative one. Podhoretz,
Kirkpatrick, Moynihan and friends answer firmly: liberalism at home for
the most part implies conservatism overseas, because the contrary forces
encountered by the US are themselves usually illiberal.
Over time their position has become more stern rather than the
reverse. This is often attributed to the fact that they are ''liberals
who have been mugged''.
Back in the 1960s, most of them were Democrats, at a time when
Democratic presidents sought to fight to end a lost war in Vietnam. Amid
those traumas they were, exceptionally, carried to the Right rather than
to the Left. They concluded that America should continue to stand for
the values of the Free World, but that she could never do so by propping
up foreign regimes which did not share them.
This made their thinking, at least, logically consistent, and they
deplored the disorientation and weakness of the succeeding presidents.
Most ended up in Ronald Reagan's camp, where indeed they gave the main
impetus to his foreign policy.
They were soon disillusioned by George Bush. Some even backed Bill
Clinton, though now they are, not surprisingly, unhappy with him too.
Where they go next is a bit of a mystery, but the author is sure they
will remain influential.
For the foreign reader, the most revealing aspect of this volume is
the almost complete absence of the world outside the US as an objective
reality. The focus is entirely on the American mind, at best in its
struggles to realise American values, at worst in the ruthless jockeying
for place and patronage in Washington.
That other nations may have their own principles and policies, no less
valid in their way, just never seem to occur to Ehrman, nor indeed to
the brilliant brains he writes about. That tells us a good deal about
why US foreign policy is forever going wrong.

FAMILIES COPING WITH SCHIZOPRENIA
Jacqueline Atkinson and Denise Cola
John Wiley &amp; Sons, #14.95
WE say: ''He's one in a hundred!''. Praise indeed for a special friend
or colleague. But one in a hundred people, 55 million worldwide, ARE
special. They are affected by schizophrenia, the most widespread serious
mental illness. Most victims are bright young men in their twenties. The
illness has no known cause or cure. To quote one expert, ''No war in
history has produced so many victims, wounded so many people; no
earthquake has claimed so high a toll; no other condition has deprived
so many young people of the promise of life.''
Mental illness affects one family in four. It's three times more
common than cancer and can be just as devastating. It is 3000 times more
common than Aids. Yet the subject, even the word, is taboo.
If you had cancer you would not be left alone to cope. Yet too often
the families of schizophrenics are given the diagnosis, and just left to
care alone as best they can. A patient's mother says: ''A typed, xeroxed
sheet of telephone numbers of support groups and a book list would be
better than nothing. I was given no information at all. It's such a
shock. If it's your son or daughter, it's a heartbreaking nightmare.
Their mind is like a miswired plug sending the wrong messages. The
harder they try the worse it gets. In this situation it takes you all
your time to keep breathing, never mind zap into action as if you were
an efficient professional when you have no knowledge of the subject at
all.''
The authors, both Glasgow-based experts on schizophrenia, have
discovered how true, how universal, this is, so three years ago set up a
pilot project for relatives in South Glasgow. 'It's a service to
minimise stress for relatives. It's a new approach, unique to Glasgow as
far as we know. If people with schizophrenia are to do more than merely
survive in the community, then not only do they need adequate services
and resources, but so do their relatives. We had 770 names in South
Glasgow; we knocked on 550 doors and set up 14 education groups as a
basis from which other more specialised services could grow. Many folk
said: ''Where were you years ago when we really needed you?''
Because the book is based on experience of actual cases and real
relatives it is realistic and quite ready to criticise the NHS. Families
will welcome its feet-on-the-ground, jargon-free approach.
GPs are often very ignorant about schizophrenia and would do well to
read this book. ''GPs have little experience of how to identify, never
mind manage this heartrending, appalling illness. They are also bad at
handing over control. Carers are regularly exploited. The Community Care
Act puts the family at the centre yet information is withheld. You can't
expect families to look after relatives as unpaid help and yet not give
them the advice and information. We found problems doing it via the
Community nurses because of confidentiality, so we may use local
libraries next time.''
New technology in the form of Spec scanners should improve research.
Dr Coia told me: ''Till recently we have only been able to look at brain
structure, but schizophrenia is a disorder of brain function not
structure. The scans enable us to see what goes wrong in the information
processing, why messages don't always travel along pathways. Research is
really jumping forward. Many schizophrenics on medication do well.''
Finding money for the pilot project was impossible as the Health Board
won't fund it. (That in itself says much about attitudes to
schizophrenia and to carers.) But now the service is up and running --
and in huge demand -- it is funded by the Health Service. But so far
it's still restricted to South Glasgow. If you live north or east --
tough luck.
''The next step is to persuade the Health Service to run training
courses on the system. Then other areas can make use of our reseach,''
hopes Coia.
Care in the community is much talked about, but as novelist Nina
Bawden, herself a carer says, ''It would be fine if there were such a
thing as care in the community, but there ain't! It doesn't exist. I
haven't seen it yet, nor has anybody.''
Schizophrenia, like cancer, is a tragic thing to happen to anyone, yet
attitudes in the media, reinforcing misconceptions, make it worse. Until
Coronation Street or Eastenders tackles the subject and dispels public
ignorance, we must rely on books like this and pioneering projects like
the one in South Glasgow.

The Moor's Last Sigh.
Salman Rushdie.
Jonathan Cape, #15.99
ONCE upon a time novelists told straightforward stories and readers
knew where they were in Bleak House and The House of the Seven Gables
and The House with the Green Shutters as these imaginary homes-from-home
were inhabited by characters who plausibly carried the narrative. Then
along came modernism and novelists indulged in Freudian free association
as they made language larger than the narrative life of the characters:
you read Finnegan's Wake for the style, not the story.
Magic realism, as practised by many postmodernists including Salman
Rushdie, attempts to combine traditional narrative with Joycean gestures
that question the connection between fiction and fact. Thus, in
Rushdie's The Satanic Verses (1988), two travellers appear to be drawn
from life until they are transformed by a fantasy that provocatively
examines the nature of faith, teasingly explores the ability of
individuals to hold to beliefs that are often unbelievable.
For factual reasons he obviously regrets, Rushdie is the world's most
famous -- or infamous depending on your beliefs -- writer of fiction
which does not mean he is the most widely read author of our time.
His ostentatiously polished prose won him many literary prizes (the
Booker for Midnight's Children and so on) but one savage sentence,
composed by Ayatollah Khomeini in 1989, made him a household name: ''I
would like to inform all the intrepid Muslims in the world that the
author of the book entitled The Satanic Verses (has) been sentenced to
death.'' God only knows how many folk actually read The Satanic Verses
but they certainly read all about its author as, with police protection,
he sought privacy from the publicity of the fatwa. He was the novelist
who made news.
Punters, more familiar with sporting news than with magic realist
novels, dropped his name in pubs -- heard about the driver who went to a
secret address and shouted out ''taxi for Rushdie'' -- and Prime
Ministers and Presidents considered the pros and cons of his case. After
some diplomatic moves Rushdie was increasingly seen in public and
increasingly regarded by the public as a public figure, famous for the
fatwa rather than for the quality of his fiction. His new book is a
courageous effort to affirm the literary authority he enjoyed when he
published Midnight's Children in 1981.
Courageous because some folk will inevitably read the new book as an
allegory of his own experience after the fatwa. The narrator begins by
summarising the tormented tale of his life: ''I have lost count of the
days that have passed since I fled the horrors of Vasco Miranda's mad
fortress in the Andalusian mountain-village of Benengeli; ran from death
under cover of darkness and left a message nailed to the door . . . and
I in a far-off country with death at my heels and (a) story in my hand,
a story I've been crucifying upon a gate, a fence, an olive-tree,
spreading it across this landscape of my last journey, the story which
points to me. On the run, I have turned the world into my pirate map,
complete with clues . . .''
Born in Bombay, Rushdie crossed from one culture to another when he
emigrated to England in 1965 and his narrator -- Moraes Sogoiby,
nicknamed Moor -- describes himself as ''a high-born cross-breed''. He
is the male heir to a spice trade big business in Cochin, but is
disinherited by his mother, the artist Aurora da Gama, and deprived of
what he thought of as naturally his. The themes of persecution, cultural
displacement, betrayal and banishment have connotations that point to
Rushdie's own character yet Moor should not be viewed simply as a
self-portrait of the artist as a suffering man just because he believes
in outdoing death: ''Life itself being crucifixion enough.''
Like Rushdie's other novels, The Moor's Last Sigh is a fiction about
the meaning of fiction. Moor is telling a story about himself telling a
story and tells the reader what he is doing: ''I want to tell you a
fairy-tale. In the end, stories are what's left of us, we are no more
than the few tales that persist.'' Moor skilfully directs a large cast
of characters into highly dramatic tales -- take the tale of his father
Abraham Zogoiby and his adventures with the cargo ship Marco Polo -- and
you realise he is frequently poking fun at the reader, testing his
belief in the imaginative truth of fiction.
He also sets fictional alongside factual characters. Moor's mother
Aurora, we are told, became the great beauty at the heart of the Indian
nationalist movement and was admired, perhaps adored, by Nehru. After
serving two years in Dehra Dun District Jail she spent her 21st birthday
in Bombay in 1945 and invited Nehru to her party though he was otherwise
engaged. Such tales are told with such conviction the reader, willingly
suspending disbelief, takes them as true stories.
The scene shifts rapidly in The Moor's Last Sigh, moving from Cochin
to Bombay and beyond: ''From Bombay nunnery to Benegeli folly, my life's
journey has taken just 36 calendar years. But what remains of the tender
young giant of my youth?'' That is a question Moor answers by parodying
the precocity of Rabelais's Gargantua: ''By the age of seven-and-a-half
I had entered adolescence, developing face-fuzz, an adam's apple, a deep
bass voice and fully-fledged male sexual organs and appetites; at 10, I
was a child trapped in the six-foot-six body of a 20-year-old giant . .
.''
Moor falls for Uma, daughter of two depressives, and is banished
because his mother disapproves of his beloved. The affair has fatal
consequences and leads Moor to confess the cruelty in himself -- ''I
admit it: I am a man who has delivered many beatings''. He works as a
brutal strike-breaker, acts as ''a murdering fanatic'', goes to
Benengeli to recover his mother's stolen paintings and becomes a
prisoner who finds love with a fellow captive. He finally feels only
love endures beyond defeat. End of story but there is much more to the
book than the plot. This is a wonderfully confident novel by a man who
knows how to spin out a yarn with mind-stimulating style. It is a
masterpiece of magic realism.

WHITEWASH -- Pablo Escobar and the Cocaine Wars
Simon Strong
Macmillan, #16.99p
THERE are signs on the highways of Colombia which warn ''Don't dump
corpses''. It is a very stark example of just how cheap a currency life
is in this desperately poor South American hell-hole where, it is
estimated, the illegal drug trade accounts for between 10% and 15% of
the gross domestic product.
In Simon Strong's engrossing expose of corruption and violence,
pseudonyms are used extensively to protect the identity of his
informants. Few people are brave or foolhardy enough to put their names
in the literary frame -- for to do so is tantamount to suicide.
Strong, a writer with an extensive experience of South America,
concentrates his terrifying account on one man. Until he was finally
gunned down by armed police in a remote jungle hideout, Pablo Escobar
was probably the world's most notorious drugs baron.
Evil, amoral and sociopathic, he began his nefarious career as a child
stealing gravestones (he rubbed them down and resold them). Quickly he
graduated to car theft, before moving on to make some real money in the
cocaine trade.
Through Escobar's own shocking story, Strong is able to reveal the
depth of Colombia's social, economic, and political problems. Corruption
in the establishment, particularly in the highest echelons of the police
and the government, is endemic. It is a direct result of the influence
of the drugs trade which, by its insidious nature, ensures that Colombia
practises an altogther different code of morality from the rest of the
civilised world.
There is a culture of extreme violence. Murder is neither here nor
there. If you disappear, you disappear. Children leave school and
immediately -- proudly, in fact -- embark upon a career in the family
drugs business. Few are expected to be alive to pick up their retirement
package.
Honest farmers and legitimate businesses are driven to failure because
of the distortions caused by the laundering of drugs profits.
Sometimes, according to Strong, this has meant that Colombia has been
nothing more than a giant money-washing machine which is lubricated by
bribery, impunity, and political influence. Any politician who attempts
to defy the powerful drugs cartels ends up with a bullet in his brain.
When Escobar was killed, the Colombian authorities claimed a great
victory in the cocaine war; but in the end it was just another business
opportunity. The vacuum left by his demise was filled by opposing
cartels.
Strong's conclusion is bleak indeed. Despite the efforts of the police
and the US Drug Enforcement Agency, the lethal trade continues. It is
impossible to stop because it is an accepted part of the nation's life
and there is a lack of both political and social will to bring it to an
end.
That will need a South American revolution -- not against the
Government but against the real power in Colombia, the drugs barons.

COLLECTED STORIES
Peter Carey
Faber, #14.99
THIS is a combination of Peter Carey's two short story collections,
The Fat Man In History and War Crimes, together with four uncollected
stories which appear here for the first time.
They are deceptive fantasies which usually begin with a simple
pleasure or encounter and unerringly render unlikely worlds with a logic
and pattern we can understand. There is a coldness and ferocity, a
curious combination of surrealism and naturalism, and a disregard for
time and place.
They can be angry and concerned, yet the anger is usually controlled
and is almost always justified within the story, though it is best when
coupled with Carey's fine sense of irony. He has always been ready to
display an original and disturbing view of the world. When this is
compressed into his stories, it usually accompanies an environment far
closer to Carey's last novel, The Unusual Life of Tristan Smith than
Oscar and Lucinda, with which he won the Booker Prize in 1988.
These stories are never obviously political, but at their heart is a
grumbling discontent, especially with contemporary society. He is
recurringly anxious about writing, about the loss of invention or the
disappearance of imagined worlds. And yet his invention seems endless,
as though he continually surveys society and finds us wanting.
He dislikes consumerism and waste and is continually forced to invent
ways of relaying his message. The shadow and its substance is something
other writers have used before, especially in the Soviet Union and its
satellite states, though I am especially fond of a story by Bert Paton,
which concerns someone who could not stop collecting shadows and found
them overtaking his life because he did not know what to do with them,
where or how they should be stored.
Peter Carey is less direct. In Report on the Shadow Industry he tells
us: ''Yesterday I drove in from the airport past shadow factory after
shadow factory, large faceless buildings gleaming in the sun, their
secrets guarded by ex-policemen with alsation dogs.
''The multi-coloured smoke these places emit is said to be a trick,
but popular belief has it that the smoke contains the most powerful
shadows of all, those too loud and significant to be packaged.'' This is
typical Carey, working along the edge of our knowledge, developing the
margins of our expectations and using his wonderful powers of invention
to show us something we think we already know, whose implications, we
feel certain we have already digested, but which has the capacity to
instruct or to shock. The craft is in the brevity. Report on the Shadow
Industry is less than three pages long.
His strongest implication is the way the world has been corrupted by
American culture. We see its influence in almost every story, especially
those aspects we seem to have absorbed and maybe developed as our own,
hamburgers, cola drinks, rock'n'roll; and he constructs elaborate
metaphors.
In A Million Dollars Worth of Amphetamines Carlos loses freedom and
love in his quest for a fortune, and in American dreams the miniature
replica of Mr Gleason's home town, complete with locals, is corrupted
when American tourists arrive to photograph them for a dollar a shot.
The opening story Do You Love Me? Is a tilt at Carey's native
Australia and a mysterious vanishing landscape which is unloved and
therefore doomed to disappear. He returns to love at the end with a
piece that is more autobiographical than fiction. A Letter to Our Son is
an account of the birth of his first child, a time when Carey thought
his wife had cancer. He borders on sentimentality and the tone is
confidential, as though we had come across this piece by mistake, as
though the reader had intruded on a defining family moment.
It is gentle, warm, and far removed from the detachment and predigious
invention of the early stories.

FRANK Bruno tonight gets his fourth, and almost certainly last, chance
to win the heavyweight championship of the world when he meets World
Boxing Council champion Oliver McCall at what will be a super-charged
Wembley Stadium.
National fervour will abound as the 33-year-old Londoner bids to beat
a man he once employed as a sparring partner. A roar to match any FA Cup
final goal ever scored will greet the big man as he emerges from the
dressing room and the old stadium will be awash with Union Jacks.
Bruno will get unbeatable backing, but no-one knows better than
himself that it is now or never. Nine years and 45 days after his first
joust at the ultimate prize, Bruno feels that this is the best chance he
will ever get to win the coveted belt, and he really does have a big
chance.
Bruno's first shot at the title, at the same venue in 1986, ended when
a right hand from Tim Witherspoon dismantled him. His other two attempts
ended when first Mike Tyson and then Lennox Lewis took him out.
Subsequently, McCall, a tough 30-year-old from Chicago, pulled off one
of shocks of the decade when he bombed out Lewis almost a year ago. That
and a successful defence against veteran Larry Holmes has sent his
reputation soaring.
The champion posseses a good chin -- he has never been on the canvas
as a professional or as an amateur -- he is not prone to cuts, and he
has that thundering right hand.
Bruno's best tactics, if early attempts at a knock-out fail, would be
to get behind his solid left jab, keep his chin tucked in and go for a
points victory. Of course, the longer the fight goes, the more we will
be reminded of the big Englishman's late lapses in the past . . . but he
can do it.
As usual, Bruno will give it his best shot, but if that is not good
enough tonight against a man who is almost a stone lighter then it will
be back to the pantomime scene with virtually no chance of a fifth
appearance in a world championship ring.
On the same bill, London's Nigel Benn should successfully defend his
WBC super-middleweight title against America's Danny Ray Perez.

THE BOROUGH, Michael Cannon, Serpent's Tail, #8.99
* GLASGOW'S West End has inspired several novels, but Michael Cannon
may be the first writer to spin a sustained fiction around its
working-class southern sister, poor but proud Partick by the Clyde. It
is a good novel, and an unusual Glasgow novel in that it has the ring of
observation rather than of disguised autobiography. Cannon handles his
stoic characters, living ordinary lives in bad marriages and quiet pubs,
with the warmth of a less sentimental Steinbeck, and his style is free
both of chippy Kelmanisms and painful attempts at the demotic. His
first-person narrator is a real creation: an intimate stranger who knows
everyone and takes part in everything yet seems poignantly distant, as
though flying over Dumbarton Road on wings of desire.
KEITH: TILL I ROLL OVER DEAD, Stanley Booth, Headline, #5.99
* IF there's one thing worse than a fan biography of a pop star, it's
an insider biography of a Rolling Stone, especially if it's Keith
Richards, whose only distinction outside 20 or 30 great pop records is
his selfless attempt to solve the Western drugs problem by using up all
the drugs himself. Laughable in its pretentiousness and loathsome in its
sycophancy, Till I Roll Over Dead exemplifies Frank Zappa's definition
of rock journalism: people who can't write interviewing people who can't
talk for the benefit of people who can't read.
THE BREAST, Philip Roth, Vintage, #4.99
* ONE fine morning -- to paraphrase Metamorphosis, which is the whole
point of Philip Roth's 1973 novella -- Professor David Kepesh awoke from
uneasy dreams to discover that he had turned into a giant breast.
Feminists might be inclined to see this as a fitting revenge on the rest
of Roth's super-brainy sex-fiend heroes, but even that would be more
than The Breast deserves. The transition from tragedy to black farce
loses the dimensions of pity and forgiveness that make Kafka's story
great literature, and Roth's scabrous sex comedy rings hollow in this
bleaker context. Heavy with symbolism that symbolises only a middle-aged
intellectual's sex anxieties, The Breast is finally nothing more than a
flashy and conceited conceit.
DEATH THE PALE RIDER, Vincent Banville, Poolbeg, #4.99
* ALTHOUGH Flann O'Brien is said to have had a sideline in detective
novels, Dublin never had a fictional shamus of her own before Vincent
Banville invented John Blaine, a wisecracking knight in tarnished armour
whose chivalric forebears are Lord Philip de Marlowe and Sir Samuel
Spade. Unashamedly derivative as his adventures are, Banville uses
Dublin's boomtown contrasts well to create an atmosphere of life lived
on the edge of the law and the vicinity of a sore face. Hired to take a
blackmailer off the back of a rich man's gay son, John Blaine cuts quite
a swathe through the kind of pubs and clubs you don't see mentioned in
Bord Na Failte leaflets, trailing dead men and empty bottles all the
way.
FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT: Paris In The Sixties, Peter Lennon, Picador,
#5.99
* YOUNG writers and students in these straitened days will read Peter
Lennon's memoir with almost nauseous envy. From a teenage job in the
Dublin Savings Bank he scraped up a few newspaper contacts and shagged
off to Paris in 1959 with #30 in his pocket, no relevant experience, and
no customers for his copy. For the next 10 years he was in on every
worthwhile story of France's most turbulent decade -- interviewing
Algerian terrorists, reporting on police atrocities, becoming part of
the evenements of May 1968, making lifelong friendships with Ionesco and
Samuel Beckett, and interviewing Salvador Dali in his pyjamas (Lennon,
that is). This is a droll, genial, and more than slightly fly account of
a time and place when everything was up for grabs.

IAN PAUL at the Coca-Cola Cup draw
IN the space of 14 days later this month, Celtic should have
demonstrated to their fans whether the renewed hope that spawned a
record sale of season tickets is likely to be justified.
When the Parkhead team yesterday drew their oldest rivals in the
quarter-finals of the Coca-Cola Cup at home it put the seal on a
demanding two-week spell which will give a clear indication of the state
of the squad and its claim to be challengers to Rangers.
The Coca-Cola tie, which has been seized for live television coverage
by Sky on Tuesday, September 19, comes in the middle of a five-game
examination, encompassing league, cup and European questions, which will
require the correct answers if the promised land is to remain in sight.
The programme facing Celtic tells its own tale:
* Sunday, September 10: Aberdeen v Celtic (live TV premier division).
* Thursday, September 14: Batumi v Celtic (Cup-winners' Cup).
* Saturday, September 16: Celtic v Motherwell (premier division).
* Tuesday, September 19: Celtic v Rangers (Coca-Cola Cup).
* Saturday, September 23: Hearts v Celtic (premier division).
The problems for Celtic are particularly severe in the period between
their Cup-winners' Cup tie and the Coca-Cola match, when they have a
long journey to and from Georgia, leaving little time to prepare to meet
Motherwell.
Rangers have a busy period, too, but are better off in that they play
Raith Rovers in the league on Saturday, September 9, allowing them an
extra day ahead of their trip to meet Steaua Bucharest in the Champions'
League the following Wednesday, but they, too, have a tough series in
quick succession. Their schedule is:
* Saturday, September 9: Rangers v Raith Rovers (premier division).
* Wednesday, September 13: Steaua Bucharest v Rangers (Champions'
Cup).
* Saturday, September 16: Falkirk v Rangers (premier division).
* Tuesday, September 19: Celtic v Rangers (Coca-Cola Cup).
* Saturday, September 23: Rangers v Hibs (premier division).
A lot could have been gleaned about both teams by the time that little
lot is over but, whatever else happens, there will be no greater fan
ferocity than on display for the first time in the revamped Celtic Park
for the Coca-Cola tie, which will be played to a finish.
Two players who have been over the course a number of times, Peter
Grant and Richard Gough, discussed the prospect with undisguised relish.
Both had been assuming that the first clash of the teams would be at
the end of the month in the league at Parkhead, but now there will be
two confrontations inside 17 days at the same venue.
''To be honest, I am delighted,'' said Grant. ''There is no bigger
game on the calendar and it will be the first at the new stadium, the
first with Gazza in the Rangers team. For us it will be a yardstick to
see how we are progressing.''
Grant is likely to have the job of being Paul Gascoigne's immediate
opponent, but is excited by the prospect. ''I can't wait to face him. He
has a smashing talent and getting him was a real coup for Rangers. I
will give him the utmost repsect and I hope he will do the same for
me.''
He pointed out that Rangers used to consider this competition their
own when it was the Skol Cup, while Celtic have done better since the
change to a new sponsor (''It is because they are drinkers and we are
tee-totallers''), but reckons the home advantage doesn't mean so much as
it might in other cirmcustances. ''When it is the Old Firm, form is not
much help.''
His advice to to players who will be enjoying or enduring the
experience for the first time, like Andreas Thom and John Hughes, would
be to try to savour it ''because it goes past so quickly.''
Gough would go along with that. He reckons possible first-timers, like
Gascoigne, Stephen Wright, Gordan Petric and Oleg Salenko, should be
told first that this will be faster than any other game in which they
have participated.
''Gazza is a big occasion player and they don't come any bigger than
this,'' said Gough. ''Petric is so laid back I doubt if anything could
bother him. We call him Perry Como. Wright is a quiet lad who should
cope well, while Salenko won't know what it is all about.
''My advice to our new boys would be to try to keep calm. Sometimes
players can get caught up in the atmosphere and it is best to keep a
cool head. The team that does that usually wins.''
Gough is happy that that the last twice the teams have met in cup-ties
Rangers have won 1-0, in the Tennents Scottish Cup semi-final two years
ago and in the Skol Cup semi three years ago. On both occasions his team
finished with 10 men. ''I'd settle for the same result with 11 men on
the park this time,'' he said.
Inevitably, the Old Firm names dominated the draw, but the three other
ties have a lot going for them too.
Motherwell will welcome their manager's old team, Aberdeen, to Fir
Park in a game that could be as fiercely contested as the one at
Parkhead, while the vagabonds of the tournament, Airdrie, will be a
tough lot for Partick Thistle to overcome, as Hibs discovered in the
third round, and Hearts will not be excessively confident about their
visit to Dundee.

SOME other wine writers tell that they are bored by Chardonnays, white
wines made by the famous grape originally from the Burgundian village
which gave it its name. The Chardonnay has proved to be a versatile
grape producing good wines in almost any location, but fine wines much
more rarely. It produces many styles, from the full rich savoury
Burgundies which can still manage remarkable finesse, to the almost
clincal and piquant Californians (though there are some opulent
Californians too, like Cuvaison).
What may be boring is that inexpensive Chardonnays are not usually
worth raving about, though they always seem to be worth drinking. Most
of the wines of the Pays d'Oc which are Chardonnays are simple and
straightforward though some seem a bit green (and these benefit from a
year's keeping). An exception in that it was rather good was James
Herrick Chardonnay which has become so deservedly popular as to be
advertised in the Spectator magazine which lists a number of outlets.
Last year it was, for a time, cheapest in Safeway. Suitably chilled it
has a crisp elegance and more than a hint of the grape's capacity for
feeling full and big in the mouth.
The sad fact is that to taste this grape at its best is costly. The
best is from Burgundy, and Oddbins have a good run of white Burgundy at
the moment. The dearest white Burgundies nudge and cross the
#100-a-bottle barrier. Stopping at half that level, a party of friends
built a kitty and bought a handful of Oddbins' best which we tasted over
a weekend at the Glendaruel Hotel, a charmingly situated and inexpensive
hotel in Cowal about 16 miles west of Dunoon.
The aim was to see whether the quality improved as the cost rose. The
cheapest wine cost #9.99 and the dearest #49.99. We managed to afford
these because there were tasters who each put #30 into the kitty. We did
not go up to Le Montrachet which costs the earth but stopped at one of
its neighbours, Batard.
Auxey Duresses 1992 (Domaine Jean Pascal et Fils) was the first at
#9.99. It should be drunk young -- and was! It was pronounced good, but
nothing special and if anything seemed a bit dear. A Puligny Montrachet
of the same year (Domaine Etienne Sauzet) was much better -- rich,
savoury, dry, and complex it was much enjoyed. It was much dearer at
#18.99. Puligny is generally though to make better wine than Chassagne
(both villages having added Montrachet to their wines' name to share its
reflected glory; and there are overlapping vineyards) but a Chassange
Montrachet 1989 was better -- and dearer at #26.99.
This was Premier Cru, La Baudriote from Domaine Gagnard-Delagrange. I
felt this was ageing already and it is true that white wines generally
mature quickly which is why their price rises steeply when in
comparative infancy. It had the full but elegant style, but was rivalled
by a very different style of wine, a Nuits St Georges 1992, also a
Premier Cru, Clos de L'Arlot at the same price. Bute Wines had a recent
tasting of Domaine de L'Arlot wines which I was unable to attend but of
which I heard many good reports. This example was very fine -- lean and
well-structured -- and proved to be the wine most tasters would have
bought, had they been able to afford it.
A slightly dearer Meursault 1991, Les Pourozots, from Jobard, at
#27.99 made less impact, but the dearest wine was felt to be the best,
the Batard Montrachet 1992 Grand Cru from the Domaine
Gagnard-Delagrange. This had a great presence, silky fullness and was
very long-lasting. The price, a whisker under #50, was a major inhibitor
to the very notion of buying it. That is the bind with such wines. They
are quite the opposite of boring but they are priced too far from our
palates, even when paid for from kitties.

CELTIC will have to go through with their European Cup-winners' Cup
tie against Batumi of Georgia as per schedule, despite fears that there
are serious risks involved in travelling to the trouble-torn former
Soviet country, writes Ian Paul.
UEFA yesterday announced that the tie should be played as it was drawn
and that means Celtic making the trip to the Black Sea resort on
September 14. A statement from Parkhead said that UEFA, whose president
Lennart Johannsen and secretary Garhard Aigner were in Georgia this
week, had assured the club and the SFA that Batoumi ''was safe and
suitable'' for the tie.
Celtic have accepted the ruling and will release travel details of the
trip shortly. In light of the length of the journey and the prospect of
playing a league game against Motherwell little more than 24 hours after
returning, the club had considered asking for the league game to be put
back a day.
Motherwell had agreed to a switch if required, but the draw for the
Coca-Cola Cup, which puts Celtic into a quarter-final with Rangers at
Parkhead on the Tuesday, left Celtic with a Catch 22 situation. They
would be only two days away from the Old Firm tie if they delayed their
league match and in the circumstances they decided to leave things as
they are.
Celtic Supporters' Association secretary Gerry Madden said: ''I can't
be hypocritical as I am going to Georgia myself, but I would advise all
fans to get full medical advice before planning the trip.''
Despite continuing speculation about John Collins and a move to
Middlesbrough, there was no indication yesterday that a transfer was any
nearer than before.

Mingulay: An Island And Its People
Ben Buxton
Birlinn, #10.99
WHAT is known of Mingulay in popular culture? Probably little more
than the Mingulay Boat Song written by Hugh Roberton of Glasgow Orpheus
Choir fame, and no more meaningful than a good name to fit an old
Lochaber tune.
My knowledge of Mingulay had only slightly more personal depth. My
maternal grandmother, born illegitimate in Oban in 1898, was daughter of
a woman whose ''domicel'' was Barra, but who herself had been born in
''Minglay'' in 1867. This was information I gathered on a single visit
to the Scottish Record Office to investigate my family tree.
The island is the largest of a group of five to the south of Barra,
itself the most southerly part of the Long Island (the Outer Hebrides).
Mingulay is 4km long and 1.25km wide; ''a rude figure of eight written
with a shaky pen''; its population zero, since 1912 when it was finally
abandoned.
The evacuation of Mingulay had none of the tragedy or bitterness
associated with the more famous evacuation of St Kilda in 1930, for the
people of Mingulay had acknowledged reality themselves and had begun to
move out long before the state intervened. Substantial numbers had
already moved to Barra and Vatersay, in some cases to seize land for
crofting, and became infamous as ''the Vatersay Raiders''.
As in St Kilda the problem was economic. Although some living could be
made from the land, the difficulties of supplementing it from the sea
were insurmountable -- there was no natural harbour, and landing on the
island could be impossible, as it still is today, in inclement weather.
The Congested Districts Board set up in 1897 approved the building of a
derrick for landing cargo (completed by 1891) but it was too little, too
late.
The local people were portrayed by a series of outsiders as insular
and sullen, not least because of their dumb refusal to pay rent and
rates over a decade, while enjoying services like a school, the building
of a church and the derrick.
The true picture was more complex -- numbers of men visited the east
coast for the herring fishing; they went to places like Glasgow to sell
fish and for other work; and they sought agricultural work in the
Lowlands. There was also marriage between islanders and outsiders, with
a number settling in Mingulay rather than elsewhere. Hence the
population actually increased throughout the period of the potato
famine, in spite of severe hardship and disease.
Desertion seems to have been a natural consequence of the increasing
contact with the wider world and the need to modernise the economy --
cash was increasingly important, since the island depended on the
outside world for a range of goods.
The provision of state schooling from November 1875 helped to dilute
the local culture for its medium was not Gaelic but English, a fact
supported by the islanders themselves who saw no use for their own
language in the market place of the mainland.
This book is not all social history -- Ben Buxton covers prehistory,
natural history, topography, folk history and many other aspects of the
island's story. His sources are numerous: he is an archaeologist, and
there is a detailed examination of the remains of the human habitation;
there are several contemporary accounts and many official records
incorporated.
Perhaps most interesting is his use of an oral archive, compiled in
the 1960s, which is beautifully interwoven with the more formal records
to create a work which is that happy blend, readable and informative.
It has left me determined to visit my ancestral home.

BERLIN GRAND PRIX
THE thickness of a pound note cost Linford Christie #34,500 last night
as he lost a photo-finish verdict in the Berlin Grand Prix. Christie was
denied a fifth share of 20 kilos of gold, worth a total of #172,500,
when victory went to world champion Donovan Bailey after they had
recorded the same 100 metres time, 10.10sec. Technology revealed a
margin of 0.001sec.
The money was split among Michael Johnson, Natalya Shikolenko, Gwen
Torrence, and Sonia O'Sullivan, who maintained their 100% records over
the Golden Four meetings.
Yvonne Murray was fourth in the 5000m, one second shy of her Scottish
best.
Glasgow's Mel Neef also fell short of the national record, fourth in a
400m notable for the second-place finish (51.68) and tumultuous
reception accorded to Grit Breur, reinstated after four seasons' absence
for doping. World record-holder Haile Gebresellasie beat Moses Kiptanui

SIOBHAN REDMOND trained at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School. She has
performed with the Renaissance Theatre Company, Dundee Rep, and at the
Traverse and Tron. Her television work includes Between The Lines, The
High Life, Rab C Nesbit, The Dunroamin Rising, and Latin for a Dark
Room. She lives in North London with her two cats. She opens in The
Trick is to Keep Breathing at the Tron Theatre on September 8.
* I'M very fond of food, love eating. Long gone are the days when I
could be bothered to diet: on location, Alexei Sayle told me I eat more
than he does, and I do like to graze with several small meals rather
than three big ones.
The central character in The Trick is to Keep Breathing stops eating
and bizarrely, this prompts me to think about food all the time.
I'm not a great breakfast person but it's necessary at the moment to
have enough energy to get me to lunchtime -- or I'm incredibly grumpy by
mid-morning. (If I'm filming I like a well-filled bacon roll in the
morning. And the caterers offer cast and crew trays of cakes and
chocolates between meals. My response tends to be ''Silly not to . . .
'')
Breakfast today was bran flakes, which I detest, with banana, which I
love, and a baked potato with tuna and cheese from the Tron for lunch.
(I normally take the baked potato option at the BBC canteen too.) I was
moaning so much by mid-afternoon about the lack of sweeties that the set
designer went out and brought me some Bourneville.
My favourite things to eat will always be garlicky prawns, spinach
salad with blue-cheese dressing, Caesar's salad with fries, mince and
potatoes, healthy salads with lemon juice and black pepper. And fish,
especially fishcakes. All with buckets of real black coffee or Lapsang
Souchong.
I can't ever be bothered to cook just for me. In my fridge at the
moment there are lots of vitamin pills, lipsticks, some face cream,
vegetable juice, and rose creams. But when once every seven years I can
be bothered to cook, my guests will get haggis -- both the meat and
vegetarian kinds.
Mixing business with eating out gets in the way of enjoyment for me. I
do like a nice high tea at the Waldorf as a treat. And if the Food Fairy
waved her wand in Glasgow, I'd go to Rogano's.''

SIXTEEN single-track miles off the main road from Lochgilphead to
Campbeltown a village sign proclaims your arrival at Kilberry. The sign
is useful because there is precious little evidence of any village.
These have not been straightforward miles. The road delights in
flirting with Knapdale's giddy contours, and the seaward prospects to
where profiles of Islay and Jura harden out of a warm and woolly morning
forever hijacking your mind and your eyes away from the road. So the
journey dawdles,and if you are in the right frame of mind these sixteen
miles can make light of an hour.
The landscape is classic Argyll, which is to say that it compels the
mind's eye in every direction at once, including the past. Especially
the past. What the place needs, you tell yourself amid the standing
stones and bewildering carvings and great cairns is an archaeologist
with the soul of a poet. Such a person might do the place justice in a
great book. At Kilberry, such a person exists.
She is Marion Campbell and her book is Argyll -- The enduring
Heartland. The book has just reappeared in print after too many fallow
years. Such a book should be as available in Scotland as whisky.
Says Campbell: ''There is yet another kind of cairn. You will find it
in a fold of hill-ground where a shepherd lost his way in snow, or at a
steep corner where a cart overturned. These are not graves -- the dead
sleep in the kirkyards -- but we lay a stone on them to appease that
which here parted suddenly from its clay.
''As we near any of them, even the oldest, plundered or excavated
though they may be, you may see us hunt about for a pebble to bring in
our hand; cur mi clach air a charn - I will lay a stone on his cairn,
whoever he was, he was here when I was not, and I am the future of his
past.''
I declare an interest in this book. I am not indifferent to this new
edition. Indeed, I have helped in a small way to bring it about. I
bought the original shortly after its publication in 1977 at a time in
my life when I was still nurturing ambitions to write books for a living
rather than journalism, but I was unsure about what kinds of books I
wanted to write.
I found my role model in Argyll for the way it wove, its sense of
place with threads of poetry, humour, history, nature, landscape, and
one less easily definable thread which confronts the past with a kind of
awed respect and lifts it off the page with the highest endeavours of
the writer's art so that it smells like honeysuckle on a sea wind.
That was the kind of book I wanted to write.
I have read it many times, in whole or in part. Its linkage of short
self-contained essays and episodes lends itself to a poetry book-ish
approach. I would go back again and again to my favourites. I still do.
These would include: ''Landscapes with Figure'', a haunting initiation
into that portion of hospitable paradise which is the field between
Marion Campbell's back door and the sea; ''The Song of Deirdre'' which
sets legend into landscape; ''The Centre,'' a reverential hymn to the
enigma of Dunadd; ''The Ill Years, an extraordinary reading of the
Massacre of Glencoe. She is a Campbell, remember, and I have (according
to one genealogist's theory at least) a strain of Macdonald of
Benderloch blood and I cannot fault either her compassionate account of
what happened nor the soundness of her cry for reason and an end to the
300-year-old perpetuation of a hideous propaganda.
And when I came to write my own Glencoe book I sought permission to
quote her on the Massacre and so resumed a fragmented correspondence
which had begun as a simple fan letter in 1980.
Several times in my own writing I have turned a phrase I secretly
admired only to discover that I had subconsciously borrowed it from
Argyll, and had to put it back where it belonged. It is no meagre debt I
owe to Marion Campbell and her book, and when my friend and sometime
collaborator, photographer and publisher Colin Baxter began to expand
his catalogue with non-photographic books, I advanced the case for a
reprinting of Argyll, on the basis that it was simply among the best
books ever written by anyone about Scotland. If that sounds like too
blunt a generalisation, too uncritical an assessment, all I can say is
-- read it.
So now, after 15 years of ragged correspondence, and with the
re-publication of Argyll as an excuse, I was on the road to Kilberry to
meet a woman who unwittingly set me on roads of my own. She lives now
not in Kilberry Castle which was home for 70 of her 76 years, but in a
small cottage in the grounds. Other Campbells, nephews, have inherited.
She is smaller somehow than the ''Old done wumman'' (her phrase) of
her letters, but she is old only at a distance. Her voice and eye and
handshake are steady and the face is tranquil and a generation or two
younger than her years, even if a heart-attack and a bit of a limp have
slowed her down.
Campbells have been at Kilberry for at least 400 years, and possibly
much longer. No-one knows. The records are gone. How old is Kilberry
then? No-one knows. The records are gone.
''It's been so added to and surrounded itself with extensions and
wings. Somewhere at the core there is a simple tower house. You
encounter bits of it when you want to rewire and find you have to go
through eight-feet-thick walls,'' Campbell says.
They have been liberating walls. Despite the
big-house-and-boarding-school upbringing, the embryonic writer in
Campbell was perfectly placed and suitably blessed to imbibe a love of
Argyll's teeming archaeology and half the world's literature at her
father's knee and from her mother's milk.
''My father could bring the old ruins to life, flesh out their bones,
explaining that would have been where, which greatly helped my
understanding, and my mother had a more romantic approach to it all. My
father was also a brilliant linguist as well as a soldier (captain,
Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders) and was always reading. I would walk
in on him and ask him to read aloud -- whatever it was -- Scott,
Kipling, or Sophocles in the original Greek. He would just carry on from
where he happened to have reached but he would start reading aloud. So I
was surrounded by this beautiful noise!''
So how old was Campbell who first encountered Sophocles in the
original?
''Oh, about four or five.''
So presumably she didn't make much of it?
''Oh yes! It was such a beautiful noise -- the rhythm of it!'' she
exclaims.
Kipling remains a favourite, 70 years later. ''The rhythm again. But I
read all the time, all kinds of things. I would rather read the back of
a packet of crisps than read nothing.''
It was her father too who helped to shape her arguments about that
darkest of Argyll's hours, the Glencoe Massacre of 1692.
''I was so impressed by his reading of Glenlyon (Robert Campbell of
Glenlyon, captain of the Government troops who did the deed) as the kind
of officer -- he knew hundreds of them -- who could carry out orders but
is incapable of independent thought or action.'' And in Argyll she
wrote: ''Every revolution is full of them, might well fail without
them.''
And still, posterity has not seen the light. She confesses to being
particularly disappointed by Nationalist friends who listened to her
arguments and responded: ''Marion would say that. She's a Campbell.''
She sees the thing now (practical historian that she is, forby a
Campbell) as ''a bit of political frightfulness, the work of an alien
mind for which Glenlyon took the rap and unwittingly lent his surname to
the infany of the hour''.
In her last word on the subject, it is the pen's might which prevails
over the sword's: ''It returns and returns, the atrocity and its
propaganda, but let us make an end soon. Surely we who know of Lidice
and all the other horrors of our time -- or can learn from them -- can
find some bitter pity for the heirs of Cain.''
There are other works in the Campbell oeuvre -- five children's books,
an archaeological volume in mid-Argyll and one astonishing
''off-the-wall'' novel published in 1973. The Dark Twin bares virtuoso
powers of invention and unashamedly feminsist sentiments -- rare in a
late Bronze Age setting -- and it is surely as worthy of reprinting as
Argyll. Off-the-wall feminist publishers please note.
I read it very recently for the first time, a gift from the author,
and I found it as difficult to unravel as it was to put down. ''People
either love it or loathe it,'' she cautioned in a covering letter ,
''and that includes me from time to time.''
And in an earlier letter: ''It upsets Anglo Saxons who don't know what
it's all about, which I find reassuring.''
More baffling by far was the nature of its gestation, a series of
fragmentary waking dreams which put characters and dialogue into her
mind. She began to make notes about them without knowing what was behind
them or what sense they might make. Over several years they amounted to
a pile of loose-leaf pages, and by re-ordering them and applying what
George Mackay Brown calls ''invisible mending'', the book's
extraordinary web was woven. She is still at a loss to explain the
source of the dreams.
''I had been in London for a while and had spent some time watching
Italian and French films. I thought perhaps that was what was coming
back. Then I realised I was seeing the dreams in colour. You didn't
watch colour films in small cinemas in the 1930s! Then I began to hear
the dialogue in Gaelic . . . .''
Which prompted the obvious question. Does she have ''The Sight''?
She frowned. ''A bit, not much really.'' Then . . . ''But I would
hear, sometimes.''
Hear?
''At Liverpool during the war, watch-keeping -- (she was a Wren) I
would hear the name of a ship, and within 24 hours or so it would be
reported sunk. Once I heard the same name three times and she sailed
into port, having fought a successful engagement.''
Argyll's reappearance would be doubly welcome if it sparks off a
reappraisal of a less than wholly appreciated literary treasure in our
midst. If such a reappraisal has any justice in its make-up, it will
clamour for a new edition of Twin.
Campbell writes of things past. Given where she was born and shaped it
is hardly surprising, but in Argyll in a chapter called ''Tomorrow''
which almost seems to turn on her muse, she snaps:
''I should be sorry to leave the impression of dwelling on bygones to
the exclusion of present and future: I would prefer to see the past used
as trees use their fallen leaves, a compost to feed future roots.
History has moulded the present and will colour the future of nations as
of individuals, whether they study it or not. Only the man who has lost
his memory confronts each in bewilderment, unable to draw upon inherited
talent or acquired skill; and even the amnesiac may find his hands
moving of themselves in arts he does not know he knew. A nation which
ignores its past is in the same sorry case; sorrier still is the case of
the country whose history is fed to it through alien minds and the fogs
of prejudice.''
In her Argyll, and for that matter her Scotland, there is no less
alien no less fogged mind than Marion Campbell. It would be a good time
to restore her vision to the sight of all her kindred Scots.

BLAIR ATHOLL, September 2 -- Prince Charles Edward Stuart has turned
south and is advancing rapidly with his army, gathering strength as he
goes. The prince, whose support has so far been confined to the area
north of the Great Glen, appears to have given the slip to the 2000
troops sent under Sir John Cope to intercept him. They came too late to
stop the Jacobites occupying Corrieyairack Pass on August 28. This is
the strategic point on the military road from Fort Augustus into the
central Highlands. The 17 fearsome zigzags leading over the pass gave
Charles's soldiers a position too strong to be stormed.
Cope had reached Garvamore on the upper reaches of the River Spey,
about 10 miles below the pass, when news that the Jacobites held it was
brought to him by Captain Swettenham. This officer had earlier been
dispatched to Fort William, to take command of its beleaguered garrison.
He never got there: on his way clansmen captured him, but he was
released on parole by personal order of the prince.
Once Swettenham had been debriefed, Cope declined to give battle and
abandoned his camp to make for Inverness, which he reached by forced
marches in three days. He has had severe problems with morale and
supplies. According to intelligence reaching the Jacobite side, his
soldiers were ''very much fatigued and frightened''. During his advance,
he had not managed to raise any extra strength from clans supposedly
loyal to the Government. He did not even have spare men to send out as
scouts or on raiding parties.
Still, the exact motives for Cope's manoeuvre remain to be explained.
He could have retreated to Stirling, but probably reckoned that his best
course was to bring up support to Inverness, where Duncan Forbes of
Culloden, Lord President of Court of Session, has been working, not
without success, to keep clans in the area loyal. Cope apparently means
to march now to Aberdeen and ship his troops back to defend central
Scotland. The race will be on to get to Edinburgh first. Except for
garrisons at Stirling and in the capital itself, the Government now has
no forces to stop the Jacobites.
Charles himself said he was ''quite surprised'' at the turn of events.
Some of his advisers urged him to pursue Cope, to capture badly needed
arms and supplies. The prince agreed to send out a raiding party under
Dr Archibald Cameron, brother of Donald Cameron of Lochiel, chief of his
clan. It attacked the barracks at Ruthven, where the Spey leaves the
mountains for the plain of Badenoch. But the Jacobites had no cannon to
batter down the gates or assault ladders to scale the walls. At a cost
of 14 dead, they were beaten off. Charles said he felt ''not at all
disappointed''. He had forecast this outcome and thought it confirmed
his military judgment.
His own instinct was to turn down the road south left open to him. For
that he had strong support from the 60-year-old William, Marquis of
Tullibardine, one of the Seven Men of Moidart, who forfeited his title
of Duke of Atholl after taking part in the rising of 1715. He was sure
many more Jacobite recruits could be raised on his former lands.
He has been proved right, and the people have warmly welcomed their
deposed chief. Another of the prince's aides, John Murray of Broughton,
reports that ''men, women, and children came running from their houses,
kissing and caressing their master, whom they had not seen for 30 years,
an instance of the strongest affection, which could not fail to move
every generous mind with a mixture of grief and joy''.
The prince arrived yesterday at Blair Castle, abandoned by
Tullibardine's younger brother, James, the present Duke of Atholl and a
supporter of the Government. Charles is resting there for a few days. At
dinner last night, he charmed the chiefs by drinking their health in
Gaelic. He also went out to speak to the clansmen bivouacked round the
castle.
More recruits are certainly coming in, and more chiefs. The most
important is Ewan Macpherson of Cluny, who had at first intended to help
Cope. But he turned up at Ruthven only with an under-strength company,
and was sent home again. Another raiding party led by Dr Cameron rode
out to Cluny Castle and kidnapped him. He was taken before Charles and,
making a virtue of necessity, promised to bring out his clan. ''An angel
could not resist the soothing, close applications of the rebels,''
Macpherson said.
It is hard to maintain order and discipline among them. When the
prince reviewed his army today, he found some clansmen had vanished out
of annoyance at not being allowed to follow Cope for plunder. They had
to be rounded up and threatened before they would return. The total
force amounts to hardly 2000 ill-armed soldiers even yet.
Tonight the prince attends a Highland ball in Lude House nearby, the
home of Lady Robertson, a cousin of the Atholl brothers, and his hostess
at Blair. This revelry shows the confidence in his camp. It cannot be
long before he is ready to move on and occupy Perth.

THEY may be second division teams, but that does not mean that their
application levels in an immensely competitive division will be anything
other than out of the top drawer.
Four fascinating ties, a plethora of new players, the return of Gary
Armstrong in front of the Jed-Forest tea ladies, and a sea of fraught
expectancy will all combine later today to give grown men the wobblies.
Coming ninth in the league last year, and therefore first in the
rankings for this year's second division, were GHK, who were trained
early season by ''Gladiators'' referee John Anderson, and like many of
the captains up and down the country Steve Hirini is straining at the
leash as his side travels down to Riverside Park in Jedburgh to face one
of Scotland's few legends, the one and only Gary Armstrong, and his
royal blue side.
''We have some plans for Gary, that's for sure,'' says Hirini, who
refuses diplomatically to elaborate. ''We have been working really hard,
and we want to get the season off with a bang. If anything I will be
trying to cool the boys down.''
Armstrong, in turn, has been waiting for today for a year. ''I am
really looking forward to it,'' says the British Lions scrum half. ''I
feel honoured to be making my comeback game at Riverside. I can't wait.
They've got plans for me have they? That's very interesting.''
GHK have been bolstered by the return of a fully fit Alan Watt as
vice-captain, and the massive presence of 6ft 7in Cecil du Plessis from
South Africa.
''Of all the players, it's Cecil who seems to be jumping out of his
skin the most,'' says Hirini. ''He's very big, he's aggressive, and I
think he just wants to prove himself.''
An early season tip would be that Jed-Forest versus GHK at Riverside
could be an early top of the table decider, as the educated dedication
of GHK tries to topple the knowledge, fire and passion of an
Armstrong-worshipping Border town. Not for the faint-hearted.
West of Scotland, under Fraser Stott's captaincy, make a similar trip
to GHK's across the M8 and then down into Border country to Selkirk.
''The one thing you can say about this season is that there will be no
teams winning by 50 or 60 points,'' says Stott.
''We have a few new guys at the club, including Andrew Ker from Ayr. I
suppose we are quite confident, although I am not sure about Selkirk. We
have a lot of youngsters, who shouldn't be overawed, including the
Bullochs, and they don't have the old fear of Border sides.''
West's performance against Selkirk could provide a barometer of
Glasgow rugby's intensity, or lack of it, and if they founder in their
quest it would in no small part be due to the Selkirk coach who, if he
were playing in today's professional climate, would be a millionaire.
John Rutherford, who has been loyal to Selkirk throughout, says that
West will prove a tough nut to crack.
''Funnily enough, although we need the sevens down here to survive, we
actually go into this game without a full 15-a-side game under our
belts,'' says Rutherford.
''I can't believe the season's here. If we are at full strength I
think we can give any team a game. I took three of the West side in the
Under-21s, and I rated them, and I rate their half-backs.'' Selkirk
field a New Zealand prop, Bevan Johnston, at loosehead.
John Jeffrey, still the most eligible bachelor in the world, pulls on
his boots for another season with Kelso with more of a thought for
paying his club subscription than getting paid to play.
''I'm old, frail, and battered, and, oh yes, I'm really looking
forward to it,' says Jeffrey of today's game against Currie at Malleny
Park. ''No, we have no new players, because we can't afford them. I'm
joking, we have Ian Fullarton at second row who played for Scotland
Under-19s last year, but I think that it's going to be a dogfight this
year and our record against Currie has never been any good.''
Currie, for so long a side that have been unable to attract the big
names, and yet have succeeded through hard work like no other, field a
dynamic new full back, Dean Shepherd, who might bring some of Jonah
Lomu's touches, playing, as he does, alongside the big man for Counties.
Another New Zealander, Chad Eagle, gives the pack some added strength
and height.
''I think that all of the boys look forward to it being a bit of a
sprint of a competition and all over by November,'' says Currie captain
Ally Donaldson. ''Kelso will be hard work as they are one of these sides
that always move the ball and take quick lineouts. I think what makes
our division so intense is that there are a lot of teams that no-one
really likes to go and visit, like ourselves, Dundee, Jed, and Kelso. It
is going to be tough.''
And so it is. For a second division, add to the above list Stewart
Campbell playing for Dundee HSFP at home to Stewart's Melville and there
is interest aplenty.
GHK look to be favourites, Dundee HSFP and Kelso might end up
struggling.

THIS week's trailblazer is blazing a remarkably diverse trail. Not
only is he rapidly building a very successful business -- Time Of Your
Life Publications -- but he must be one of the youngest entrepreneurs to
be featured as a trailblazer. And not only has he won a string of awards
which recognise his contribution to Scottish enterprise, but he is also
committed to encouraging other young entrepreneurs to take the business
plunge.
When Caspian Woods started Time Of Your Life Publications three years
ago, he was a 23-year-old student at Stirling University. Since then his
turnover has doubled each year, rising this year to #60,000.
The idea of starting a business came to him during his exchange year
as a student of business studies at the University of Kansas in the US.
While there he became involved with production of the university's
student yearbook, an annual publication which lists all the final-year
students with their addresses and a photograph. Because they are a
symbol of pride in the college as well as a record of the achievement of
each individual, every yearbook printed is sold, even though the price
(on average about $35) is fairly substantial.
Woods realised that the market for similar publications in Britain was
wide open. But he recognised that a livelier and jokier approach was
essential, and that he would have to keep the price much lower.
After finishing at Stirling he took a three-month graduate enterprise
course. Having learned, among other things, how to produce business
plans, do market research and basic book-keeping, he was ready to build
up his business.
With #1700 from the Prince's Scottish Youth Business Trust to buy a
computer, and with an immense amount of energy and determination, he
began to expand. To keep the costs down for the graduating students, he
started selling advertising space in the yearbooks.
He published around a dozen different ones in 1993, rising to 40 last
year. Some of these were produced for the final-year students of a whole
university; others were published for particular groups such as medical
students at Glasgow or the vet school at Edinburgh. This year he is
doing more than twice as many. Lots of the Scottish universities, or
faculties within them, are placing orders, so are medical, dental and
vet schools throughout the UK.
This huge expansion has been achieved by very determined marketing,
dedication to hard work and attention to detail. By delegating some of
the editorial work to an assistant, Woods has been able to concentrate
on selling his publication package. He works closely with alumni
associations and through them meets the students. He gives them a kit to
guide them through the production process -- what topics to include, how
to write the copy, tips on photography, how to lay out the text, ideas
on special features, and how to raise advertising revenue. He is
available to advise at any time, but the work is done by the students
themselves, giving them useful experience in publishing, and enabling
him to concentrate on organising the final stages of each yearbook's
publication, with time left over to pursue other business ideas.
This diversification is an essential element in Woods' overall
strategy. All the yearbooks tend to be published within a two-month
period each year, making a terrific concentration of work at one time.
He is pursuing other avenues which would fit in with his expertise and
fill the less hectic periods. Among these is a Graduate Entrepreneurs'
Yearbook and another for the Prince's Scottish Youth Business Trust; he
has plans to produce anniversary yearbooks which would feature graduates
10 or 25 years on; and he has already produced a school yearbook, the
pilot he hopes for many more.
Woods confidently expects a Time Of Your Life yearbook will soon be an
essential souvenir of student days. Meanwhile, he intends to continue
enjoying the time of his life for many years to come.

THE tiros of RAF Kinloss have taken to their new found celebrity
status like high-flying ducks to water. The RAF side, first out of the
bag when the draw was made for the preliminary round of the SRU Tennents
1556 Cup, make Scottish rugby history today when they welcome Dalkeith
to their northern fastness, writes Derek Douglas.
Club secretary Roy Dinnes, one of only two non-RAF types in the side,
said: ''The phone rang the other night and my wife shouted 'Darling,
it's the gentlemen of the Press for you again'. I think she was winding
me up.
''This is all very new to us but we're looking forward to it
enormously. The TV cameras will be there and it's a great opportunity
for the boys to show what they can do.''
Dinnes, 33, who will turn out at scrum half today, added: ''In step
with the spirit of the times the match and the balls will be sponsored
today.''
He added: ''There's a great spirit in the side and when we're playing
rank doesn't apply, so on the field our captain, senior aircraftsman
Richie Wallace, is in charge despite the fact that there's pilots and
squadron leaders and all sorts playing alongside him.''
* TWO more Edinburgh clubs, Boroughmuir and Currie, have dipped into
the seemingly bottomless pool of Southern Hemisphere talent to bolster
their premiership campaigns.
Boroughmuir have enlisted North Harbour lock Darren George (6ft 7ins,
16[1/2]st) while Currie have gone for his exotically monikered
middle-row partner, Chad Eagle (6ft 6in, 18st). Both have played regular
provincial rugby in New Zealand -- the more so George -- and they were
team-mates, too, with the Takapuna club side.

THE most important season in the history of Scottish rugby kicks off
today. During this season more than any other, as the game waits
apprehensively on the threshold of professionalism, the added burden of
commercial expectation weighs heavily on the players who will carry
their clubs' hopes and fears towards Premiership destiny at the end of
November.
Six clubs will survive in Premier Division I, and the devil will take
the two hindmost. Playing success equals sponsorship opportunities and,
just as importantly, the top clubs will become top dogs in the transfer
market, which -- money or not -- will be doing a roaring trade once the
premiership race is over.
However, in a season when so much is shrouded in the mist of doubt and
uncertainty, on one point we can be certain. A top division of eight
clubs, with two staring relegation in the face, will concentrate the
mind rather in the manner of a guid hanging.
Hopefully, the paying public will become the beneficiaries and good
rugby will result. Last season, with six from 14 facing the drop, the
purveyors of gloom and doom predicted stale, safety-first rugby but
that's not how it turned out. There is no reason why it should be any
different this year.
Champions Stirling County open their title defence against Hawick. The
Greens were the only side to lower Stirling's colours last term but this
time the champions have home advantage and, as William Wallace proved at
Stirling Bridge just a hefty punt from Bridgehaugh, that's a
more-than-worthwhile advantage to have.
County captain Kevin McKenzie yesterday summed up his side's prospects
thus: ''Obviously, as champions, there is going to be a fair bit of
pressure on us but so far as we are concerned that's history, and
everybody starts off in the same starting blocks. Maybe other sides will
be that bit more keen to take a scalp but, if we want to be the best,
then we have to live with that.
''There is going to be a 25% casualty rate at the end of the season so
nobody can afford to make a slip. However, I don't think that will lead
to dull rugby. It didn't last year, and we will want to make use of our
young back division.
''We want to play expansive rugby and, as forwards, don't want to fall
into the trap of only giving the backs the ball once we've finished with
it. Okay, Hawick beat us last season but we have them at home and that's
to our advantage. Also, last year we didn't have much of a game in the
lineouts and that won't be the case tomorrow.
''Stewart Hamilton is out with a groin strain but Gavin Douglas played
against Sale last weekend and performed so well that it was going to be
nip and tuck between him and Stewart anyway,'' he said.
Hawick coach Billy Murray said: ''It's going to be tough but our
record against Stirling is good, things have gone well at training this
week, and we are confident without being over-confident.''
The main focus in Edinburgh will be on the local derby between
Boroughmuir and Edinburgh Academicals. Both sides are determined to
mount strong premiership challenges but, traditionally, there is often
little to choose betwen them on the day.
Boroughmuir coach Henry Edwards said: ''They beat us 9-8 last season
and that was a fair indication of just how tight it was. It's obviously
important that we get off to a good start. I don't think that all is
lost if a side loses the opening game of the season, but it's always
hard to built confidence after a defeat, so we won't want to be
repeating our first-game defeat against GHK last year.
''With two sides going down, everybody's aim will be a top-six placing
but it's negative to have that as your only objective.''
Academicals, who at their press day earlier this week were keen to
dispatch to the file marked ''urban myth'' the suggestion that they are
a team of handy individuals but lacking the collective will to win, held
up that victory last season as an example of how this alleged lack of
esprit de corps is a damnable falsehood.
''Anybody who saw us that day could recognise that this was a team
with great morale and togetherness,'' said president Charlie Jackson.
Gala entertain Watsonians at Netherdale and yesterday the Maroons'
rugby director Johnny Gray said: ''This is the first game of a new
season and, at the risk of trotting out the old cliche, it has to be
just one step at a time. So far as prospects for tomorrow are concerned,
Watsonians are choosing from a squad -- and I would hope that isn't
going to become the norm for clubs this season -- and so it is difficult
to determine with certainty what their team will be.
''However, we are as well prepared as we can be. Some pundits have
already written us off and I would suggest that if they are that well
informed, then they should go and see the bookies today. Without a game
played nobody can say how the championship will turn out.''
Watsonians' coach Peter Gallagher declared: ''There were special
circumstances which meant we had to name a squad for Netherdale, and I
wouldn't expect that to be a regular occurrence. It's going to be a hard
game. It's still tough to play Border clubs at home.
''There is a greater degree of expection on us this season. We were
virtually written off at the start last year and we kind of sneaked up
on folk, but this season other sides will know what we are capable. But
if you want to be a top side then you have to live with that added
pressure,'' he said.
Heriot's FP kick off their campaign against Melrose at Goldenacre,
where director of rugby Fraser Dall said yesterday: ''We go into the
game with six of our 26-man squad injured or unavailable and so we're
not choosing from our strongest pool. This season I have no doubt that
all of the sides in the top division are capable of beating the others
and so, to a large extent, it will come down to mental attitude. The
sides that want to win most will get the victory.
''I have no doubt, too, that no matter how often clubs say that they
are going to play open, attractive rugby, there is so much riding on
staying in the top division that the pressures on the players are going
to be immense.''
Melrose, from their Redpath-Chalmers international half-back
partnership, through to Shiel, Joiner et al in the threequarters, with
new recruit Rowen Shepherd the last line of defence, have on paper the
most mouthwatering back division in the championship. In the pack,
Doddie Weir is out of action through injury and here, no doubt, is where
Heriot's will perceive a weakness.

FIRST DIVISION
WHEN Allan McGraw makes even a passing remark about football, the less
experienced in management should listen.
Despite having difficult business against St Johnstone in Perth today,
the Morton manager took just a moment to sympathise with Dundee United
manager Billy Kirkwood, whose relegated squad have not enjoyed the best
of starts to the season.
''They'll be up there and fighting eventually,'' said McGraw. ''But
the biggest problem is convincing the players that they have been
relegated and that they will have to work hard in this division.''
United's home match against Hamilton today, for example, should give
them the chance to open their winning account. But as Kirkwood says:
''We have the talent. The attitude has still to come.''
Hamilton, meanwhile, without a league point or even a goal this
season, have plenty to prove to manager Iain Munro. With only 16 fit
players, they will have their work cut out against a side who will be
missing Dave Hannah, Sandy Robertson, and Craig Brewster, plus fitness
tests for Brian Welsh and Maurice Malpas.
Another blow for United is that they failed to have Billy McKinlay
relieved of his Scotland squad duty, so he, too, will not be present.
Although it sounds an unlikely scenario, there is a top-of-the-table
clash at Boghead, where leaders on goal difference, Dunfermline, come up
against Dumbarton, the surprise package of the season so far, and who
are managed by reluctant stand-in Jim Fallon, following the departure of
Murdo MacLeod.
While the Fifers send in the team who turned over Dundee United last
week, the Sons have doubts about injured Jim Marsland and Chic Charnley.
Airdrie, with Sandy Stewart back after suspension, have doubts over
Kenny Black, Paul Jack, and Sean Sweeney for their match against a St
Mirren side bursting with confidence everywhere bar the goal scoring
department.
Their line up will be similar to last week, with manager Jimmy Bone
making one or two positional changes.
Dundee, fresh from their win over Kilmarnock in midweek, make the
potentially hazardous journey to Clydebank -- a trip they made almost a
year ago with disastrous consequences -- a 5-2 defeat.
Lightning, they say, does not strike the same place twice, but with
the Tayside team missing Gerry Britton and Morten Weighorst, life will
not be easy against Bankies.

HIGHLAND LEAGUE
HUNTLY player/manager Doug Rougvie, as he prepared for today's match
against Fraserburgh, revealed his anxiety about the painful back injury
afflicting midfielder Steve Lennox.
Rougvie said: ''We are all worried for Steve, and not just because
he's a great player. He is a self-employed taxi driver and his whole
livelihood is at stake.''
The former Stoke City, Montrose and Forfar player will consult a bone
specialist next week.
Also missing from today's line-up are Martin Stewart, Gary Whyte (both
ligament damage), and Steve Gray (hamstring).
Meanwhile, Elgin City yesterday signed midfield duo Alan Dunsire
(Huntly) and Ian Woollie (Deveronvale) and both could play against
Nairn.

MOTORSPORT
JOHNNY Herbert, winner of the British Grand Prix, had his future put
in doubt yesterday when Benetton signed Gerhard Berger for next season.
The Englishman was left looking for another drive after Berger agreed
a two-year deal with his former team rather than accept second-class
status at Ferrari with Michael Schumacher's arrival.
Even in the aftermath of his success at Silverstone, Herbert was being
warned by Benetton's Flavio Briatore that he had to win more races.
Herbert has been frustrated at a lack of testing opportunities this
season and also has been criticised by the team's engineering director,
Tom Walkinshaw, about his attitude.
Berger's more could have repercussions for Scotland's David Coulthard.
Following his departure from Williams, he had been linked with a move to
Ferrari, but it is expected that he will join McLaren.

Ryder Cup question mark over proud Spaniard.
EUROPEAN MASTERS
WORLD No.1 Greg Norman and a saddened Severiano Ballesteros both
missed the halfway cut at the Canon European Masters in Crans-Sur-Sierre
on a day when Steven Richardson finished with a 13-under-par aggregate
of 131. Norman, who had won the World Series in Akron, Ohio, only last
Sunday, could not cope with the greens and shot a second round 72 for
145, two off the qualifying score.
Ballesteros continued his miserable form by shooting a 76 for 150.
There must be doubts whether the proud Spaniard will play in the Ryder
Cup if he does not show vast improvement.
Richardson, in contrast, shot a superb eight-under-par 64, which
included nine birdies and only one bogey, and that by three-putting.
The 29-year-old Richardson is currently 115th in the European Order of
Merit. He leads Eduardo Romero, the holder from Argentina, by two shots,
and Spaniard Ignacio Garrido by three with Colin Montgomerie back among
the also-rans on 138, seven behind, while US Open champion Corey Pavin
is even further behind on 141.
Richardson, who began with six birdies in his first seven holes, said:
''I haven't played really well since I last won in 1993. I've missed a
lot of cuts and I normally have Saturdays off, watching Grandstand and
going out with my girlfriend. But in the last five weeks my performances
have been good but with no results. Today was my best round of the
year.''
Norman had no excuses and said: ''This is a very humbling game. What
can I say? I didn't make a putt, it's as simple as that. You don't like
to miss a cut, especially when you come over here. I don't miss many,
the last time over here was probably in 1977, but I missed the cut at
the US Open at Baltusrol two years ago.''
Ballesteros said: ''It's the same old story. I'm trying my best but
I'm playing very badly.'' Asked whether he had any thoughts of
withdrawing from the Ryder Cup team, he replied: ''I qualified so why
should I think about dropping out? I'm not thinking about that at the
moment.''
Sandy Lyle moved up with a 66 for 137 to be leading Scot, and Mike
Miller, who needs some big finishes to avoid a return to qualifying
school, shot a 67 for 139, one behind rookie Dean Robertson, who
followed his 68 with a 70 yesterday. Sam Torrance, about to make his
eighth consecutive Ryder Cup appearance, shot 70 to make the cut with
nothing to spare.

THIS is all so brand-spanking new that you're almost frightened to
touch it in case you spoil the fresh-out-of-the-box shine. A new league
structure, a new cup competition, the promise of a European championship
next season, and, on top of all that, professionalism.
Despite all the fears that are bound to be around with so much
happening all at once, I reckon that if everybody shows common sense,
then everything will turn out right on the night.
The premiership can only be good for the game. I'm certainly relishing
matches where there will be no easy options. Every game will count and
every player in the squad will have to be capable of playing top-grade
rugby.
Under the old set-up some games weren't as hard as they might have
been and clubs could get away with having players who weren't up to it
sitting on the bench. That won't be the case now.
So far as my own club -- Stirling County -- are concerned, we are only
too well aware that we could win and lose the championship in the same
year. We won it in the spring and it will all be over by the end of
November. Last season, we were the underdogs and few folk expected that
we could do it. This season we're there to be knocked off our perch.
But if you want to be the best, then this is the pressure that you
have to live with and we're happy to do that.
On the professionalism front, there isn't a man alive who can predict
how it will turn out. It's all uncharted territory and we'll have to
pick our way through as best we can.
I was amazed at how far the International Board went. I expected them
to say that international players could turn pro and everybody else
would remain amateur. Now everybody can be a professional.
There are huge obstacles to be overcome. What, for instance, is going
to happen when the SRU put the squad under contract? What will the
relationship be between the player and his club? I can see a situation
developing when the player will be caught in the middle between his
loyalty to the SRU -- and whatever his contract says he has to do -- and
his club. There will have to be goodwill on all sides if this isn't to
become a problem.
To get paid for playing a game that you love is like a dream come true
but there's not a man in the Scotland side who wouldn't pull on that
blue jersey for nothing. However, the International Board has now
decided that the game is to turn pro and we would be daft not to make
sure that we make as much from our efforts as the game can afford.
Unless the SRU goes some way towards matching the cash that our
international rivals will get, then we will be at a severe disadvantage.
If the All Blacks, the Wallabies, or the Springboks are on contracts
which allow them to go full-time -- with all the extra training and
preparation that involves -- then it becomes like the footballing
part-timers of the Faroe Islands playing Brazil. If we want to maintain
our place in the world game, then we have to have the same opportunities
as the world's top sides.
Finally, is it just coincidence that, when I make my post-World Cup
debut in The Herald, Brian Meek goes off on holiday? Nothing sinister,
Brian, honest.

'Jessie tried, and failed, to convince me that she had been nothing
really special at any time'
SHE belonged to a different golfing era, a more austere, yet gentler
time, when ladies were not allowed to wear trousers, when amateurism was
protected as if it was the secret of salvation. For some it might well
have been, but for Jessie Valentine and her contemporaries it was an
accepted way of life on the fairways.
If Jessie at 80 retains the dignified, considerate psyche which
prevailed in her day, she also has not lost the ability to produce the
little stinging perceptions which she delivers with the same panache as
she used to dispatch opponents.
''I can't think why you would want to talk to me,'' she said. ''I bet
you thought I was dead.''
It is an observation which leaves the interviewer with very little
room for diplomacy, feeling like a golfer of her time, done and dusted
by a brilliant stymie.
Jessie is 80 going on 60, sharp of mind and wit and as sincerely
modest as she was when she became the best woman golfer in Britain and
perhaps the world. She will wince when she reads that sentence, but
there are still enough of her peers around who would insist that it is
not exaggeration.
In her prime, Jessie won 63 trophies, most of them in matchplay as was
the custom, and was awarded the MBE, the first woman golfer to be so
honoured, in 1958. It was typical of our conversation that she was
unaware she had collected that many prizes and typical, too, that she
made no mention at all of the MBE.
We chatted just before she did the opening honours for a new, bright
Lady Golfer shop in Giffnock and by the end Jessie had tried, and
failed, to convince me that she had been nothing really special at any
time.
Yet this slight little woman, 5ft 1ins on her tiptoes, took on and
beat most of the finest players around Europe and the USA in a career
that missed out the years when she might have have been at her peak,
during the second world war. ''I never played at all for five years,''
she said.
Even so, her list of triumphs takes some beating. Take a deep breath
and read her litany of victories: Three times British Champion, six
times Scottish Champion, New Zealand champion once, French champion
once, East of Scotland champion four times, Curtis Cup player seven
times, selected for her Great Britain against France, Belgium and Canada
14 times, played for Scotland every year with one exception, from 1935
to 1958, barring wartime.
Besides that lot, there were numerous other less valued triumphs, as
well as many second places, including a defeat in the last eight of the
US championship.
She refuses to agree that she was the best around in her time and
insists that she would have never lived with the great players of today.
''They hit the ball miles,'' she says with undisguised awe, ''and I
think they should get paid much more, don't you? They should get the
same as the men. I couldn't have coped with living out of a suitcase. I
had a husband and child to look after.''
She will argue that she and her contemporaries had more enjoyment.
''Golf was fun for us and we used to come in from a competition and the
lot of us would have table tennis game, all at the one time,'' she said.
''Now they come in and they are dead beat after one round. We did 36
holes. We never trained, although I did practise a lot. I just liked to
go away and practise.''
Practising, however, was a habit she developed from the age of five
after her father, Joe Anderson, who was pro at Craigie Hill, Perth,
encouraged her. Until she was 18 she had used a set of seven clubs and
even when she was runner-up in the girls' championship, her first big
competition, she used only seven of the new full set she had been given
for the occasion. The following year, using the same seven, she won it.
Jessie recalls how her dad made sure that this victory was not to be
allowed to give her an outsize ego. When she returned home triumphant he
grunted and said: ''If that's all you can win, lassie, and be full of
yourself, you'll not be much use.'' She was much use, of course, and
headed out on a 24-year span of continued success at the highest level
available to her.
How did a wisp of lady like Jessie take on and beat some of the
Amazons (my word, not hers) that were around even then? ''It must be
timing, I suppose. I did hit the ball quite far for my day, over 200
yards.''
She won the British title before she had won the Scottish
championship, although she had been beaten in the final at North Berwick
the previous year. ''I remember it was a terrible day, and we weren't
allowed to wear trousers then. Nan Baird asked if she could wear
waterproof trousers and they said 'yes'. I phoned my father and asked if
I could do the same and he said: 'certainly not, if you can't win
without wearing trousers you can forget it.' When I got home having been
beaten at the nineteenth, there was a pair of waterproof trousers
waiting for me.''
She admires all the training and exercise that goes with the
professional game nowadays, unlike in her era. ''We never did anything
like that,'' she says, astonished at the idea. ''And this counting the
yard thing we could never have done. We used our eyes and it seemed to
work pretty well.''
There were no professionals around in Britain then and the irony for
Jessie is that she turned pro when she gave up the game. ''I had decided
to pack in championship play when I was approached by Dunlop to put my
name on clubs. That made me a pro,'' she recalled.
She dismisses the thought that she could have been a star in the
modern pro circuit. ''Never. I wouldn't have won a penny. I wouldn't
have had the nerve. I think the girls today are wonderful.''
This remarkable woman broke an ankle some months ago, slipping when
she went to shops, and that kept her off the course for a while. Now she
has pins and a plate in it, but it will not stop her playing. ''I play
in the medals and like to get a couple of games in a week. I think I won
a medal last year.''
At her peak. she was a plus-3 player but will tell you a little
shame-faced that she is up to 15 now.
Husband George and son Iain have always meant more to her than golf
and still are. ''We were engaged and George was captured two days before
we were due to get married. We had to wait five years before we got
married.'' They celebrated their golden wedding in May and still live in
Perth.
After breaking the ankle, she was confined to home for three months.
Now she has use a buggy when she plays the game. ''I loathe them,'' she
says, ''you don't get any exercise.''

THE Scottish Professional Matchplay Golf Championship, last held four
years ago at North Berwick, has been revived, the PGA Scottish Region
announced yesterday.
With a starting field of 64, it will be played from September 27 to 29
at Glasgow Gailes and total prize-money will be around #30,000.
The event, which will be preceded by a pro-am on September 26, was
originally to have been held at Letham Grange. However, accommodation
problems in the Arbroath area prompted the change of venue to the
Ayrshire links.
The field will consist of the first 25 in this season's Ladbrokes
Order of Merit, the 1990 and 1991 winners, John Chillas and Ian Young,
and the remaining places wil be decided from a qualifying round on
September 18 over the course whose last Tartan Tour event was the 1979
Scottish Professional championship, won by Sandy Lyle in a play-off with
Sam Torrance.
Meanwhile, the proposed new Southern Open will not run this season but
is expected to be held in September next year.
* COLIN Gillies, the Scottish professional champion, was among four
players who shared top prize in the Cawder pro-am yesterday. The
29-year-old Falkirk pro carded a three-under-par 67 to share the
limelight with John McTear, Campbell Elliott, and Peter Smith. Leading
scores:
67 -- J McTear (Cowglen), C Elliott (Dubai Creek), C Gillies
(Falkirk), P Smith (Deeside). 68 -- D Robinson (Fereneze), C Campbell
(Loch Lomond), K Walker (Kings Links), C Maltman (Eyemouth). 69 -- R
Arnott (Caddy Shack), J Greaves (Glasgow).
Team: 121 -- Arnold Clark (Craig Maltman (Eyemouth), Andrew Haney,
John Higgins, Billy Clark).

CRICKET
THERE may be a few bitter tastes in mouths -- and that's nothing to do
with English beer -- when the celebrations begin somewhere tonight in a
pavilion housing this year's Caley 80/- Scottish counties champions.
It might be West Lothian following all the hassle over the
Aberdeenshire affair -- resolved in the Boghall club's favour in midweek
when they were awarded full points and went to the top of the league --
if the Linlithgow club can overcome Fifeshire at McKane Park.
Second-placed Ayrshire visit fellow challengers Stirling County at
Williamfield. A shock result at Dunfermline would mean that victory for
either side at Stirling would see beer glasses running over there.
Aberdeenshire, meanwhile, take on Forfarshire with a slightly forlorn
hope that other results still might run their way, while last year's
champions Strathmore visit Perthshire, and Clackmannan entertain
Arbroath County.
* MIDDLESEX opener Paul Weekes hit Northamptonshire for an unbeaten
127 and shared an opening stand of 126 with Jason Pooley (74) but the
title-chasing duo had to settle for a draw, leaving Warwickshire on top
of the county table in England.
Earlier, Rob Bailey had completed his second century of the match as
Northants set a target of 367 off 55 overs.
After 15 matches, with two fixtures each remaining, defending
champions Warwickshire have 289 points, with Middlesex on 277, Northants
266, and Lancashire 263.

SECOND/THIRD DIVISIONS
MIDWEEK cup matches can take their toll the following Saturday, and
Stirling Albion manager Kevin Drinkell will be hoping that his players
do not turn in a tired performance after their defeat by Rangers.
Drinkell, who was impressed by his former team despite their two late
lapses, said: ''My Stirling lads did themselves proud.''
Albion are believed to have collected around #150,000 from their Ibrox
adventure but that will quickly become history, except to the club
treasurer.
Drinkell delays his team selection for the home game against East
Fife, whose manager, Steve Archibald, is attempting to sign former
Rangers keeper Lindsay Hamilton on a long-term contract.
Clyde will have Kenny Gillies, Jim Thomson, and Ian Angus in the squad
to face an unchanged Queen of the South at Dumfries.
The Bully Wee manager Alex Smith is unhappy about his team's habit of
conceding two goals in quick succession. It happend in the home games
against East Stirlingshire and Forfar, and only John Hillcoat's penalty
save prevented a similar occurrence at Ayr. In all three games Clyde had
scored first.
''It is a bad habit that is simply down to a lack of concentration,''
said Smith.
Stenhousemuir have Neil Aitken back after a year out through injury,
and he is available for the trip to Forfar.
'Muir manager Terry Christie's problem will be to decide who should be
left out after last week's 3-0 win over the normally stuffy Stranraer,
who will be without striker Billy Ferguson for their home game against
Montrose.
Mark Wilson will not be available for Berwick's visit to Simon
Stainrod's Ayr United.
In the third division, East Stirlingshire have signed striker David
Cameron from Falkirk, and further good news from manager Billy Little is
that he has persuaded midfielder Iain Lee to resign. 'Shire today visit
injury-hit Cowdenbeath.
Arbroath's John Fowler is suspended for the visit to Ross County,
while Brechin City will look to Sandy Ross -- now in his second spell
with the club -- for goals against Alloa, who will travel without John
McCormick.
Albion Rovers have Paul Crawford, coach Joe McBride, and Martin Ryan
available for the home game against Caley Thistle.
Following their midweek exploits against Partick Thistle, Livingston
have a rest today. They were unable to get a lease of Meadowbank, their
old home, for the scheduled league game against Queen's Park. It is
likely to played later this month.

IF Scotland has anyone at all on the medal rostrum in Atlanta next
year, it almost certainly will be the very first competitor to confirm
her selection to Britain's team.
Shirley Robertson, from Menstrie, guaranteed her place in the
single-handed Europe dinghy class last night, with her eighth win (two
seconds) from 10 races at the Olympic sailing trials off Weymouth.
Yet it would have been impossible but for her father, Iain, who built
the family's first boat from a kit, in the garage of their
Clackmannanshire home, and a dooking in Linlithgow Loch.
''I remember my first regatta at Linlithgow,'' she says. ''I was
freezing, having spent half the time upside down. But I must have
impressed the Scottish coach, George Thomson. He seemed to think I had a
bit of guts, and invited me to train with the national squad, which then
was all-male.''
The former Alva Academy head girl, who gave up college, her boyfriend,
and her home, to chase Olympic gold, graduated in leisure and recreation
management at Heriot Watt University, but she quit after two weeks of a
masters degree, heading for England's south coast as the only logical
stage for getting her act together.
''I couldn't afford to spend my life driving up and down the M6.''
The cost, financially and in human terms, is substantial, despite
backing from Miller Engineering, and Pringle, plus the Royal Yachting
Association Scotland. Why, do Scottish World and Olympic title
contenders get no support South of the Border?
At the world championships in New Zealand last January, Shirley
experimented with a new boat: ''A mistake. The boat was not ready. I
finished thirteenth, which cost me a #20,000 Sports Aid Foundation grant
-- a financial disaster given that I expect my Olympic bid to cost
around #80,000 in the next 12 months.
''I don't care how much it is, or how hard I have to work. If I am in
debt, then I'm in debt. I always live on my overdraft, at my credit
limit on my plastic. When you are trying to be the best in the world,
debt is irrelevant.
''Sailing is like a drug. You come so far, keep improving, and want to
see what more you can achieve. I love sailing, and every day, I learn
something new.
''It does have its down side. I am sad that I don't see my parents
very often. I have not met anyone from my class at university since I
left in 1990 -- in fact I don't see anybody outside sailing. It can be
very lonely.''
That is despite a back-up team which includes several coaches -- some
brought in for two weeks at a time to hone one particular area, such as
starting, or sprints downwind -- plus a nutritionist, psychologist,
masseur, and fitness specialist -- the last named being essential when
the pulse rate frequently reaches the level of an Olympic 10,000 metres
runner.
''I pay everyone who helps me,'' she says. ''It's a professional
arrangement. But I have felt sorry for some girls this week. I have gone
for a massage while they have tightened up, lying on the beach, waiting
for the wind.''
As we chat, she laughs and giggles a lot, despite having spent nine
hours in and out of the water.
''People don't realise how physical the sport is,'' adds Shirley, who
damaged ligaments badly last year when a foot remained in restraining
on-board straps as she went overboard.
In five World Cup regattas this year, the 27-year-old Robertson has
never been worse than sixth. ''But I have not concentrated on them,''
she says. ''Because only winners from Weymouth this week go to the
Olympics, I have geared everything to the trials, and I have slipped
from world's No.1 to third.''
But she has won two out of three pre-Olympic regattas on the Olympic
course off Georgia, being denied a third this year through illness.
She has no qualms about the 100-degree heat and 90% humidity, having
access to a special acclimatisation chamber which she has christened the
Savannah Sauna.
''I am either racing or training, working out in the gym, or eating,
and in bed by 10. It is a selfish life, fanatical and obsessive. I'm
sure normal mortals think I'm mad. But I believe it is worth it.''

STALWARTS of the past firmly occupied the foremost places after the
first round of the Shell Scottish Seniors Open yesterday at Royal
Aberdeen.
In unusually benign weather, the holder, Spain's Antonio Garrido, five
times a regular tournament winner, led the procession with a score of
63, seven under par and two below the previous professional record.
Brian Huggett, with 19 victories in his day, followed on 64 and
Maurice Bembridge, who won 12 times, joined the South African, John
Fourie, a former winner of the British title, a stroke further behind.
Neil Coles and Tommy Horton, who were on 66, in their heydays won 28 and
seven times respectively.
As last year, Garrido, aged 51, had his son Daniel as his caddy, at
10, a year older and evidently wiser, since his father described him as
''my manager.''
Whether or not on Daniel's recommendation, Antonio used his driver
only twice, preferring his No.3 wood from the tee to keep the ball in
play on the narrow, fast-running fairways.
In compiling eight birdies in halves of 31-32 for his lowest score as
a senior, Garrido, who last month lost in a play-off to John Morgan for
the PGA championship and once partnered Severiano Ballesteros to a World
Cup success, made five of them in succession from the second, and only
two with putts beyond ordinary length.
Except that he holed a second putt of 15ft at the eleventh to keep his
card, like Morgan's alone free of bogeys, Huggett, now 58, owed
comparatively little to the mallet-headed putter to which, apart from
two weeks of disaffection, he has kept loyal through good and bad for 28
years.
It also obliged for an eagle when he hit a No.3 wood from 247 yards to
five feet at the 530-yard second.
Huggett won this season's first event, in Kenya, and has not been out
of the first 10 since. Bembridge has not matched that consistency nor
did he the economy of Fourie's 27 putts, but then, but a lad at 50, the
former joint course record-holder at Augusta on 64, gave away the
maturity of his years only by puffing on a pipe.
By the time Bembridge and Horton were finishing, rounds had become a
test of patience and concentration since, as each professional was
attached to a handicap player, they were taking five hours to complete.
Coincidence or not, Bembridge and Horton, who made 12 birdies between
them, also bogeyed the last, the former pulling wide of the green and
the latter driving into a bunker.
Coles, 10 years Bembridge's senior, won last week's tournament and
although he once had the reputation of not relishing links golf, he has
been joint second in the two previous championships and was in confident
enough form to overcome the setback of having dropped three strokes at
the seventh and short eighth which he double bogeyed. Leading
first-round scores:
63 -- A Garrido (Spain).
64 -- B Huggett.
65 -- Fourie (S Africa), M Bembridge.
66 -- N Coles, T Horton.
67 -- J Hudson, N Ratcliffe (Australia), B Browne, N Magnusson
(Sweden), A Dokka (USA), A Croce (Italy), J Morgan.
68 -- R Campagnoli (Italy); F Boobyer, H Inggs, (S Africa), B Carter.
69 -- D Creamer, R Webster, F Hill, B Waites, D Huish.
Other Scottish scores:
70 -- J Hamilton, M Moir.
72 -- H Bannerman.
73 -- I Smith, J McAlister, G Gray.
74 -- A Gauld.
75 -- S Wilson, F Rennie.
77 -- J Hume.
79 -- G Will.

JOHN Watson remembers the day only too well. He was driving along the
M8. The radio newscast told him that Guinness, the new owner of the
Distillers Company, had announced its first significant restructuring of
Scotland's biggest whisky group.
The main casualty was the Buchanan blending and bottling complex at
Stepps. The new owner had decided to shut it completely. ''That was an
absolute bombshell,'' Watson recalls. ''Buchanan's Black and White brand
was our biggest single customer at the time. We had vans going to Stepps
two, three, even four times a day.''
It is at moments like these that family-owned companies have to dig,
and dig very deep, to find the will and the wherewithal -- in terms of
substitute business -- to survive. But John Watson &amp; Company, colour
printers, graphic designers and packaging specialists, has done more
than survive.
The whisky industry is still a major customer, accounting for around
half of Watson's #2m plus turnover. But the customer base -- whisky and
non-whisky -- is now sufficiently diverse to prevent another
heart-stopping loss, like Black and White, endangering the entire
operation.
''The one thing about printing,'' says Watson, ''is that everyone
needs it.'' But he is too much of a business realist not to acknowledge
that, in the past 10 years, the sector has gone through more
roller-coaster changes than in all the centuries before, since
Guttenburg and Caxton gave the world the means of making mechanical
marks on paper.
With desktop computer technology proliferating, the cost of entry is
dropping. Just as every city and town in the land seems oversupplied
with car hire firms, so the printing sector is increasingly
over-populated too. To compete successfully you have to be both
aggressive in pursuing business and technically capable of supplying a
product with an edge on the rest.
''We are a very aggressive company,'' Watson says. ''We don't wait
around for orders to happen. We go out and knock doors.'' The Watson
company also believes it has something special to sell, thanks to a
blend of traditional craft skills and the latest technology. It has had
plenty of time in which to assemble that know-how.
The original business opened its doors on September 9, 1861, as a
stationer's shop at 9 St Vincent Place, Glasgow. To support the retail
business, a small jobbing printing operation was established in Black
Street, Townhead, providing business cards, compliments slips, invoice
forms and a thousand and one other items to order for Glasgow's
burgeoning Victorian commercial heartland.
''We serviced RW Forsyth for a hundred years and we've outlived
them,'' observes the present generation John Watson. But with the rise
of the multiples, independent stationers found the going increasingly
tough. ''By the mid-sixties you couldn't give away Parker pens, when the
likes of Lewis's and Boots were offering three Biros for 10p,'' he says.
So the St Vincent Place shop was sold and the money used as a down
payment on new industrial premises in Kyle Street, where the firm
remains today. Watson has continued to invest in new equipment -- the
latest is a five-colour Heidelberg press with a price tag near #400,000
-- to maintain a competitive edge in the printing of high quality items
such as whisky labels.
''We run the company the way your granny would have run the
household,'' Watson says. ''If we can't afford it, we don't do it. We
don't go in for high gearing.'' Steady investment on that canny basis
has equipped the plant with all the machinery necessary to produce the
kind of top quality labels -- incorporating foiling, embossing, creasing
and all the other tricks of the printer's trade -- that are a
prerequisite of a premium product today.
Apart from whisky, the company prints for a wide variety of other
sectors, from computers to legal firms, from property agents to hotels.
Watson has also established a growing niche in the pharmaceuticals
market. A lot of the design work is carried out in-house, cutting out
advertising agencies and other intermediaries. Other designs are
downloaded over telephone lines, direct into the company's own computer
systems.
Watson, I should add in the interests of total disclosure, even prints
for our parent company Caledonian Publishing, everything from
letterheads to the Wee Red Book which lists each season's football
fixtures.
In the old days, John Watson adds, the standard turnaround on jobs was
six to eight weeks. Now he sometimes gets whisky customers asking, on a
Friday, for 100,000 labels by Monday morning. ''We are a quick reaction
printing company. There are no ifs or buts. If they want it, they get
it.''
Now 47, he is a graduate of the Leeds School of Printing and has been
in the family business for 30 years. He has three young sons, but adds:
''They'll have to be good to come in here.'' He is conscious of all the
fates that are supposed to befall family companies as generation
succeeds generation.
''There have been offers but I wouldn't like to sell out,'' he goes
on. ''If I did I might be able to put a few million in the bank. But
then I'd just have a different kind of investment to worry about. I like
to be able to leave here every night, even when times are tough, and say
to myself: 'See that brick there, I own that.' We're very proud of this
place.''

SCOTLAND'S Shirley Robertson needs only the rubber stamp of chief
selector Mike McIntyre, Scotland's former Olympic champion, to send her
to her second consecutive Olympic Games.
Two second places and a first yesterday gave her an unassailable lead
in the Europe class at the Brut British Olympic sailing trials off
Weymouth.
It was mid-afternoon before the breeze swung to the south west -- the
most settled direction for racing -- and competitors were set a target
of three races despite the light wind strengths.
The Scots collected their best of consistent, if not sparkling,
results in the gentle breezes. Andy Richards and Ian Park (Helensburgh)
made a late run in their preferred conditions in the 470 class taking
two second places, behind Jamie Lea and Simon Hughes, then chasing class
leaders John Merricks and Ian Walker whose two first places should now
equip them with sufficient points to qualify comfortably for Savannah,
where the Olympic sailing events will be held.
In the Mistral men's windsurfing class Adrian Jones (Ayrshire) took
two second places and a tenth while 1992 Barcelona representative Barry
Edgington leads having won twice yesterday.
* LIGHT breezes overnight once more reshuffled the 10-boat five-nation
fleet in the Teacher's Round Britain Challenge and allowed Jon
Fitzgerald (Oban) to recover the two-mile lead that Ireland's David
Harte had built up in Pride of Erin. The pacemakers should pass Aberdeen
late today. Details:
Positions 3pm yesterday: 1, Ireland II (D Harte) 278 miles to go; 2,
Scotland II (J Fitzgerald) 278; 3, England II (D Alan-Williams) 278; 4,
England I (V Cherry) 280; 5, Ireland I (D Gomes) 281; 6, Scotland I (P
Jeffes) 282; 7, France III (J P Saliou) 282; 8, Wales I (R Tudor) 283;
9, Wales II (C Lyons) 283.
Brut British Olympic Trials -- 470 Class Race 9 -- 1, J Lea and S

STIRLING COUNTY
Captain: Kevin McKenzie
Coach: Brian Edwards
Sponsor: Carlsberg
Last season: Champions
Prospects: John Manson arrived close season from Dundee HSFP and
rugged former Highland scrum half Murray Fraser has also thrown in his
lot at Bridgehaugh after a spell playing rugby and lumberjacking in New
Zealand. More arrivals might have been expected. The heat is on. County,
who thrive on their self-imposed tag of the outsiders of Scottish rugby,
must show that they have the spirit and wherewithal to cement their
place at the top of the pile.
WATSONIANS
Captain: Fergus Henderson
Coach: Peter Gallagher
Sponsor: Caledonian Brewers
Last season: Second
Prospects: So near yet so far last season. The Hastings boys will
continue to form the bedrock of the 'Sonians effort. No Sean
Fitzpatrick, as intriguingly hyped during the summer, but five Kiwis and
an Aussie No.8 bolster a strong squad and, for the future, an innovative
under-21 set-up. Championship effort crumbled last year when the going
got tough. Still in the running for the John Connor pot of gold.
EDINBURGH ACADS
Captain: David McIvor
Coach: Bob Easson
Sponsor: Glenmorangie
Last season: Third
Prospects: It would be unfair to classify Accies in the same category
as the illustrious Glasgow side whose (ex-)coach uttered the immortal
phrase: ''When the going gets tough our guys go ski-ing.'' Unfair indeed
when one considers that the egalitarian Dave McIvor is again at the
helm. However, the Raeburn Place men, more eager than ever this season
to downplay their unwanted ''toffs'' tag, have never turned glittering
promise into championship silverware. Strength in depth boosted by an
under-21 section managed by David Sole.
HAWICK
Captain: Brian Renwick
Coach: Billy Murray
Sponsor: Pringle of Scotland
Last season: Fourth
Prospects: A new mood of realism prevails at Mansfield Park. A
commercial consultant has been appointed, and the recruitment of the
Craig brothers from West of Scotland underlines how the ''aye been''
concept of playing only local lads has been, rightly, consigned to the
dustbin. Derrick Grant and Jim Renwick bring their talents to the
coaching team and Andrew Barnes, the 6ft 8ins Scottish Schools lock --
and son of Ian of that ilk -- is another likely playing recruit.
BOROUGHMUIR
Captain: Peter Wright
Coach: Henry Edwards
Sponsor: McEwan's
Last season: fifth
Prospects: Their propensity for blowing hot and cold makes them as
unpredictable as the wind blowing across the Meggetland parkland.
Consistency must be the main aim this season. Half a dozen new faces
have arrived close season, most notably Fergus Wallace from GHK. A Kiwi
lock, Darren Lloyd, will provide bulk in the second row and Sean Lineen
will marshall the backs. 'Muir know, though, that they must deliver
soon. Like Watsonians, they await an announcement of the destination of
the Connor largesse.
HERIOT'S FP
Captain: Stuart Paul
Coach: John Foster
Sponsor: McEwan's
Last season: Sixth
Prospects: The raw material is there to mount a stern challenge.
Graham Dall and Hugh Gilmour are both on the verge of full international
honours and a fully fit Cammie Glasgow, despite his failure to make that
one, final push into the big time with the RWC party in South Africa,
still represent a potent force behind the scrum, where much will depend
on the form and fitness of 6ft 8in Andy Macdonald, who must lose the
gentle-giant tag. Only side with sponsored shorts -- the shirts still
considered sacrosanct under terms of the Greyfriar's Trust.
GALA
Captain: Gary Isaac
Coach: Peter Dods
Sponsor: McEwan's
Last season: Seventh
Prospects: To be a Braw Lad or not to be a Braw Lad? That is the
question which Gregor Townsend will answer any day now and for the
Netherdale faithful the answer can't come soon enough. It may be folly
and unfair to equate club success with the future of one player, but
Townsend's ability is such that this is, indeed, the case. Mike Dods is
for Northampton, but other defections were stymied when Gala made
behind-the-scenes changes to put the playing side on a sounder footing.
Antipodean imports expected soon.
MELROSE
Captain: Bryan Redpath
Coach: Rob Moffat
Sponsor: Calders
Last season: Eighth
Prospects: The four-times champions scraped into the new, eight-team
elite by the skin of their collective teeth but, again, have the
resources to mount a formidable challenge if only they can get the act
together. Doddie Weir, recovering from an ankle operation, will be a big
miss in the early stages of the campaign, but Craig Chalmers, playing
with an authority which now matches his experience, will be kingpin of
the Greenyards effort.

ENGLISH OPEN
WENDY Dicks remained in line for the biggest cheque of her brief
career when adding a 68 to her opening round of 67 to extend her
overnight lead in the second round of the Wilkinson Sword English Open
at The Oxfordshire Club yesterday.
This left Dicks with a nine-under-par halfway aggregate of 135 to lead
by four from a chasing pack of five, including Solheim Cup players Laura
Davies and Trish Johnson, with Dale Reid and Julie Forbes the only Scots
qualifiers. Six others missed the cut.
Dicks, whose best performance in three years on the Tour was
twenty-third in the Irish Open two months ago, coped admirably with the
pressure of holding the overnight lead.
She opened with pars at each of the first five holes, then made
birdies at three of the next four to be out in 33. A drive into water
cost her a shot at the eleventh then, after a birdie at the short
thirteenth, Dicks missed from two feet to take three putts at the next
hole.
Any thoughts of a collapse were dispelled when Dicks struck a
No.7-iron shot from a fairway bunker to four feet for a birdie at the
sixteenth before holing from 18 feet for another birdie on the home
green.
Davies was back to her best with six birdies in her 67. Her solitary
bogey was at the eighteenth, where she missed from four feet after
having found sand. ''I played very well and it could have been a 61 or
even a 59,'' she said. Leading scores (British or Irish unless stated):
135 -- W Dicks 67, 68.
139 -- F Dassu (Italy) 69, 70; I Maconi (Italy) 71, 68; A Arruti
(Spain) 71, 68; T Johnson 71, 68; L Davies 72, 67.
140 -- J Morley 70, 70.
141 -- S Prosser 74, 67; L Fairclough 71, 70; D Barnard 68, 73; R
Lautens (Switzerland) 72, 69; S Bennett 71, 70.
142 -- S Nicklin 74, 68; C Hjalmarsson (Sweden) 70, 72.
Other scores included: 143 -- M-L de Lorenzi (France) 71, 72. 144 -- D
Reid 69, 75; J Forbes 74, 70; A Nicholas 74, 70.
Scottish non-qualifiers: 149 -- L Irvine 74, 75. 150 -- C Panton-Lewis
77, 73. 151 -- M McKinlay 73, 78. 153 -- J Kinloch 77, 76; T Craik 75,
78; G Stewart 75, 78.

LAKE Coniston could be easier to back than to catch in the Haydock
Sprint Cup today.
Though the July Cup winner has been quoted at 4-9 in the build-up to
the #130,000 race, he is likely to be offered at a more attractive price
this morning.
He has not run since the Newmarket success two months ago -- a long
lay-off for a sprinter. Of those he beat in the ''July,'' the only one
to run with any distinction since is Nunthorpe winner So Factual, who
failed to give his running at Newmarket.
It is certainly posssible to believe that So Factual and Cherokee Rose
are good enough to win this race in an average year. But no-one who saw
Lake Coniston's triumph at Newmarket can feel this is an average year,
and if he runs like he did last time out, he is most unlikely to be
beaten.
Desert Shot's fine turn of speed will make him hard to beat in the
September Stakes at Kempton. He showed himself as good as ever when
scoring in similar company at Windsor and Michael Stoute's decision to
give him a quick reappearance should pay dividends.
High Patriarch is a very interesting southern raider for the Hambleton
Cup at Thirsk. Trainer John Dunlop has been patient with the
three-year-old who has only run four times to date in his career.
Given plenty of time to find his feet and not subjected to anything
like a hard ride in each of his races, High Patriarch looks to possess a
good deal of ability.
DENYS Smith has been training for ages and has done just about
everything within the sport, but even he was pleasantly surprised at
Sedgefield yesterday when completing a hat trick with Cornet, Staigue
Fort, and Val de Rama, each ridden by Peter Niven.
They were the 71-year-old handler's first runners of the new jump
season, and for good measure, Smith also was on target on Haydock's Flat
card with Densben -- a 164-1 accumulator with his only four runners
during the afternoon.
''What a brilliant start to the jumps season,'' said Smith. ''I've had
several four-timers in my career, and I can remember saddling four
winners at Perth about 30 years ago.''

THE effects of this year's dry summer will be felt by sheep farmers
next year, according to Dr John Milne, deputy director of the Macaulay
Land Use Research Institute in Aberdeen.
Introducing the institute's work on a new computer model which will
predict the effect of sheep grazing on upland moors and hills, Dr Milne
said that sheep would continue to do well in dry conditions.
The drought would, however, have a serious effect on vegetation.
''Animal performance this year will not be that bad but if you overgraze
your pastures one year -- and obviously they are being over-grazed at
present -- you will reduce production next year.''
Dr Milne was confident that there would be no long-lasting damage to
vegetation caused by this year's hot dry summer. ''You would two or
three such summers before you get a serious impact,'' he said.
The institute is currently upgrading its computer-based hill-grazing
management model which, for the past seven years, has been used by a
number of agencies to assess the potential impact of sheep stocking
levels on hill farms. The current model predicts the impact of ''an
average sheep in an average year''.
The new version, which is being developed at a cost of #200,000,
largely provided by the Scottish Office, will be able to cope with a
number of variations including a wide range of climatic conditions.
It will also assess the varying impact of summer and winter-grazing
regimes and the use of different breeds of sheep. ''Animals eat in
relation to their liveweight, so a Welsh mountain ewe removes less than
a Blackface,'' said Dr Milne.
It will also be possible to predict the effects of replacing some of
the sheep with cattle or deer -- or the impact of grouse.
One of the applications of the computer-based predictions would be to
forecast the potential impact on the landscape of different livestock
policies. ''Landscape and tourism have become much more important,''
said Dr Milne.
''In rural areas tourism can provide 50% of the local income. In the
last few years we have had more demand for native pinewoods and birch
woods. To achieve that you need much lower levels of sheep grazing.''
Throughout the European Union there is concern at the impact of
changing grazing patterns on hill vegetation. In the UK it is estimated
that the area of heather moorland has declined by 25% since 1940 as a
result of overgrazing by sheep.
The increased ability to forecast effects on hillsides and moorlands
could make it easier for CAP changes to take account of stocking levels.
It would become possible for subsidy calculations to be based on an
assessment of total liveweight rather than flock numbers.
Payments could be directed towards maintaining a wide range of plants
and species. Farmers could be paid to carry out an active policy of
burning heather in order to encourage regeneration.
The practice of ''muirburn'' had declined in recent years, partly due
to increased forestry and partly due to lack of labour to supervise the
burning, said Dr Milne. Old heather tended to become more open which
allowed tree seedlings to take root.
The insitute's computer model is already widely used by agencies like
Scottish Natural Heritage and the Scottish Landowners' Federation, but
Dr Milne forecasts that it will in future be used directly by farmers.
''There is a new generation coming up which is accustomed to
computers,'' he said. ''There is a gentle revolution taking place in the
way we manage our resources and tools like these are one way it is going
to happen.''

YOUNG Enterprise Scotland should be off to a flying start this year if
the antics of executive director Owen McGhee are anything to go by.
McGhee is a member of the Spice Club which tries to add a little oomph
to its members' lives, but his latest daredevil escapade beats them all.
He recently took part in a free-fall parachute jump 12,000 feet above
Errol airfield in Perthshire.
Attached to an experienced parachutist, he plummeted to the ground at
120mph for 35 seconds before his companion opened their chute.
Later this month, McGhee plans to paddle in a Canadian canoe between
Fort William and Inverness, a journey he reckons will take four or five
days.
All these extra-mural activities should prepare him for the year
ahead, which he expects to break even last year's record of 4000
students aged between 15 and 19 participating in Young Enterprise
Scotland initiatives.
Computer buffs
redraw the map
PROPERTY consultant Hillier Parker has a network of offices throughout
the UK, and last year opened its Glasgow office, or should I say it
opened its Georgia office, for it appears the firm's computer buffs have
given all its offices American titles. This means that the Edinburgh
office is called Hawaii, while the London West End base is Kansas, and
the City office is New York.
Lucy Mullen, associate partner in Glasgow, told Business Diary: ''We
are all linked by computer which means that instead of asking our staff
to send a message to Edinburgh we ask for it to go to Hawaii.''
Lucky old Edinburgh, but there could be a slight problem if staff have
difficulties with their geography. Mullen first told Business Diary that
Edinburgh was Florida, or Florida was Edinburgh, if you understand what
I mean, when in fact Florida is Birmingham. However, she corrected
herself before we went to print, otherwise staff in Edinburgh might not
have known where they were, or where they were supposed to be.
Stress-free is
sugar-free too
ANY stressed out business person attending the Optimum Living Workshop
being run by Jacqui Hazzard of Napiers Dispensary in Glasgow on
September 16 and 17 should be careful about what they take in their
packed lunch.
I hear whispers that she is going to check what participants have
brought along, and if you are caught with chocolate biscuits tucked away
for a mid-day feast then marks will be deducted.
Tea will be supplied and, in keeping with the mood, we are told it
will be Stress-Ease herbal tea made from exotic ingredients including
passion flowers, limeflowers, skullcap, camomile and St John's wort.
Personally, I would smuggle in my own tea bag, which is probably a sign
that I could do with attending the seminar to learn a few things about
health living.
It costs #50 and anyone interested in going along should give her a
call on 0141 334 0705.
Dancing, not
surfing, the Net
FOLLOWING his presentation at the Locate in Scotland seminar held
during the American Bar Association's annual general meeting in Chicago,
David Flint, a partner in MacRoberts, has been receiving numerous
messages on the internet.
Flint, who is a whizz-kid on the Net, has been taking up a fair chunk
of cyberspace since his return home, replying to questions from India,
Australia, Mexico, Italy and Texas.
One questioner from Argentina covered a wide range of topics including
pan-European legal issues, socio-political points and corporate law, but
added a polite PS asking if it would be possible to give details of
publications on Scottish country dancing. Flint immediately passed the
enquiry over to his pipe-playing partner Ian Dickson, who is currently
putting together a list for transmission. Further questions to
dfmacroberts.co.uk
Braveheart in
bloodless coup
THERE could have been another battle of Stirling this weekend when the
film industry hit town for the opening of Braveheart starring Mel
Gibson.
Instead of taking over Stirling Castle, the film moguls had their eyes
on the university's MacRobert Arts Centre. The only problem was it was
already due to be occupied by 750 international delegates attending the
annual Scotblood/British Blood Transfusion Society conference.
However, the delegates decided not to spill any of their valuable
blood defending the centre and retreated quietly to the Gannochy Sports
Centre, where a new conference facility has been created.
After raising the white flag, and to prove that there was no bad
blood, Mairi Thornton, donor services manager for the Scottish service,
quipped: ''It was a bloodless coup. We're quite happy with the change of
venue.'' To help make amends, the delegates are being treated to a
special screening of Braveheart on Monday.
Retiring but still
plain speaking
THE Royal Bank of Scotland's Mr Glasgow, David McVicar, bowed out of
banking this week. Officially, he retires in the middle of the month but
he is off for a fortnight's holiday in Cyprus to prepare himself.
Many Glasgow and West of Scotland companies will have dealt with him
during his tenure as chief manager of the Royal's Buchanan Street branch
and, more recently, as the bank's head of corporate business in Glasgow.
In this capacity he had many dealings with Rangers FC, who bank with
the Royal, and no doubt was consulted before Walter Smith pulled off
some of his spectacular transfer deals. He obviously did not say ''no''
very often to the club, but he was known to be blunt when the occasion
required it.
One colleague recalls a foreign lady promising to inject a substantial
amount of capital into a West of Scotland company. The bank had several
meetings with her, and had asked for some concrete proof of her wealth
before proceeding. None was forthcoming and eventually she was asked
once again to substantiate her claims. She said: ''What can I say?'',
and quick as a flash McVicar replied: ''Goodbye''.
Have a gala time
with Amnesty
IF you fancy an entertaining evening at the theatre, and want to help
a good cause at the same time, Amnesty International has a gala evening
in the King's Theatre, Glasgow, at which members of Scottish Opera and
Scottish Ballet will be appearing. The Scottish Chamber Orchestra will
also perform as will jazz singer Carol Kidd. Tickets for the evening on
September 10 cost between #5 and #20.
Sparks fly as
banker lets rip
THE following quip was overhead earlier this week during the massive
fireworks display in Edinburgh sponsored by the Bank of Scotland. A TSB
official, admiring a golden cloudburst which resembled gold coins
cascading down from the heavens, said: ''Reminds me of the Bank of
Scotland's customer charges.'' Bitchy.
Can you help
Trades House?
GLASGOW'S Trades House is looking for help on two fronts. It needs
volunteer guides to take visitors around Trades Hall. Training will be
given, and anyone interested should contact the hall secretary on 0141
228 8000.
Trades House has recently appointed Murray Blair as its official
librarian, and he would be delighted to receive books, photographs and
other material about crafts or the city of Glasgow. If you have anything
he might be interested in you can call him on the same number.
Sweet smell of
aerosol success
LET'S finish this Business Diary on a sweet note. It is not often you
find a politician smelling of roses, but Shadow Scottish Secretary
George Robertson should have no trouble on Monday, September 11. He is
opening a new aerosol line at the Sanmex factory in Rutherglen that day,
and will take the opportunity to outline Labour Party policy for the
small and medium-sized business sector.

* I would value your advice on how best to save small lump sums and
monthly amounts of #50 approximately for our newborn child.
* Investment trust savings schemes spring immediately to mind. These
permit purchases of the shares in an investment trust through irregular
lump sum payments and monthly savings. Typically the minimum for lump
sums is #250 and for monthly contributions from #20 upwards.
Investment trusts use their funds to buy shares in a broad spread of
commercial and industrial companies and are often diversified on an
international basis. Because of this they are ideal for small investors
since the usual risks of a single investment are reduced. Most have good
capital performances over most periods of time.
Transaction charges are low when the money is invested through the
trusts' savings and investment schemes. And, unlike an insurance policy,
you are not committed to maintaining monthly payments over a
predetermined period. You can cancel, reduce or increase them as you
want.
Investment trust savings schemes are often used to build up nest eggs
for minors. Once a reasonable holding has been established in one trust,
it makes sense to let it lie and switch payments to another.
* Three years ago I inherited a substantial portfolio of shares. I
have no way of comparing its performance, except to say that I was
extremely disappointed when I valued it recently. The shares were worth
#104,782 on June 19, 1992. They are now valued at #108,512. This seems a
paltry gain. My only real benefit has been a good flow of dividends, but
even here I seem to be losing out as there is substantial extra tax paid
to the Inland Revenue because I pay tax at 40%.
I do not wish to give the impression that I am looking a gift horse in
the mouth, but my feeling is that I would have done better with the
money in a high-interest building society account or in National Savings
certificates. My first experience of share ownership has certainly not
impressed me. I would value your comments.
* Over the three years you ought to have done much better, being
invested in shares, than with your money in building societies or
National Savings. Your problem is that your particular portfolio of
shares has under-performed the stock market by a significant margin.
Since mid-June three years ago the FTSE-100 share index, which measures
the performance of the top 100 companies by market capitalisation, has
risen by 35.8%. Your shares have increased by just 3.6%.
Inherited portfolios were often built up many years ago when
circumstances were radically different. It is always wise to let a
stockbroker review such holdings at the time of inheritance and at
regular intervals thereafter.
Since you do not give us any details of the shares you have it is
impossible for us to make any recommendations about changes in your
investments. In any event the performance over three years suggests that
a radical overhaul is needed and we would urge you strongly to consult a
stockbroker who will suggest various changes to you.
We would make a number of other points. A sizeable proportion of a
six-figure sum should normally be invested in the stock market,
especially when the beneficiary is a 40% taxpayer. Note that you would
have had to pay extra tax on building society interest, though the
question would not arise with National Savings certificates.
You should also be considering the merits of personal equity plans,
partly because the capital you have at your disposal could result in the
occasional capital gains tax liability and partly because you are a
higher rate taxpayer. The most important consideration, however, is to
get your portfolio in good working order.
* What is your opinion of the PEP offered by Legal &amp; General with
guaranteed income of 7% net and guaranteed return of capital after
five-and-a-half years? As a retired lady having used up my tax allowance
it seems a much better return than National Savings certificates. Have I
overlooked something?
* The Legal &amp; General (L&amp;G) corporate bond PEP is guaranteed as long
as L&amp;G remains financially sound and it is hard to imagine any
circumstances in which such a large and well-established company would
run into difficulties. However, if you had to realise your investment
before the term was up you could get back less than you put in and the
investment might fluctuate somewhat in value during the term.
The 7% yield might look below the 8% many of these PEPs say they will
return, but it is after all charges so it is competitive. It is
certainly superior to National Savings, though don't forget the
Pensioners' Bond, which yields 6% to 20% taxpayers without any charges.
While within the PEP rules, the L&amp;G product is not within the spirit
of the Government's intentions over corporate bond PEPs. L&amp;G will
effectively be using the PEP to finance part of its own borrowing. This
is of no concern to you, though, and having the guarantee provided by
such a well-known name will be reassuring.
* I gave up self-employment a year ago and have a retirement annuity
of #32,000. On reaching 65 in a few months I should also receive the
state pension. Other investments are mostly in my wife's name. At the
same time another personal pension fund of #40,000 will be available to
provide a further annuity. My wife is 12 years younger and would receive
half the present pension should I die.
Would it be more profitable to delay drawing the annuity until I am
75, allowing the fund to accumulate, or provide my wife with the lump
sum should I die before 75 years? On the other hand, should I take an
increasing pension now with 100% wife's participation?
* The pension along the terms you describe would be tiny because it
would effectively be determined by your wife's age and her life
expectancy would be some 30 years. If you are also talking of
index-linking, then the annuity would be only a little more than the
real return available on index-linked gilts of 3.5%, producing an annual
income of roughly #1700 on the #40,000 fund. So it would be worth
leaving the value to accumulate if you can.
* I understand I can give away #3000 each year free of inheritance tax
and #2500 to a grandchild. Is the latter each year and is it also free
of inheritance tax in addition to the #3000 each year? What if there
happen to be two grandchildren?
* There is only one main annual inheritance tax exemption and this is
the #3000 you mention. There is no specific exemption in relation to
gifts to grandchildren. There is, however, another annual exemption for
small gifts up to a total of #250 made during the year to any one
person, and although this is in addition to the main annual exemption,
it cannot be used to cover part of a larger gift. In other words, it
only applies where the value of all gifts in a year to any individual
does not exceed #250.
You may be confusing the gifts to grandchildren with the tax
advantages of the old deed of covenant scheme where annual payments were
made to a child by a grandparent under deduction of income tax which was
repayable to the child. This scheme is no longer effective for income
tax purposes.
* I own, under mortgage, a second property which is let to students.
Currently it is in my name only. Could you advise me whether it is worth
transferring to joint ownership with my wife for capital gains tax
exemption in the event of a sale in two or three years time? Is the
procedure for transfer as straightforward as a simple declaration and
can this be done at any time prior to the sale?
* A simple declaration will not be sufficient to create joint
ownership as it will be necessary to have the title to the property in
your own and your wife's names. This is, however, a straightforward
procedure and your solicitor will be able to provide details and let you
know the cost involved. It will also be necessary to consider the
position of the mortgage as the lender may view the change in title to
the property as an alteration of the security over the loan.
If the mortgage is also transferred to joint names, you should seek
advice when claiming tax relief on the interest payable. Income from
jointly held assets is split equally for tax purposes unless you declare
that you should continue to be assessed on the total income. The
question of who is entitled to claim the tax relief must, therefore, be
considered carefully.
The transfer to joint ownership can be done any time before the
property is sold and you will both be entitled to the annual capital
gains exemption against the gain arising.

Brian retreated into a world of psychosis. The Beach Boys would never
be the same again
WHEN you come back from a trip to the dark side of the moon, it stands
to reason that you're going to burn up a little on re-entry. Thus Brian
Wilson, at once the hero and villain Beach Boy, appears for all the
world like a stroke victim in the throes of recovery. The speech is
slurred; the mouth slopes to one side.
But at least he is talking. There was a time when he couldn't. Or
wouldn't. When he went to bed and didn't get up for two years. He was
the classic genius (with Pet Sounds he did, after all, make the finest
rock album of the sixties) who walked the tightrope between sanity and
madness. Then one day he fell off the wire and plunged into a dark world
of depression, paranoia, and drink and drug abuse.
Don Was's quite stunning documentary, I Just Wasn't Made For These
Times, which opens a new Omnibus season (BBC1, Sunday), is a privilege
to watch. Until now Wilson has been the Howard Hughes of rock music,
insular and reclusive. This is the first time he has faced the cameras
and spoken in depth about his life and his work. This is, then, a
genuinely unique and fascinating programme. Filmed with great style in
monochrome, it also features a rare studio session from the musician,
recorded last year in New York.
Save for Brian's surviving brother, Carl, the remaining Beach Boys are
conspicuous by their absence on screen. Was, one of America's top record
producers, has persuaded almost all of the key figures from Brian's life
(his mother, two daughters, former collaborator Van Dyke Parks, and rock
stars like Randy Newman, John Cale, Tom Petty, David Crosby, and Graham
Nash) to participate, but of Al Jardine and Mike Love there is,
significantly, no sign.
The Beach Boys, heavily influenced by the close harmony style of the
Four Freshmen, invented their own very special brand of rock and roll
music, tapping into the local Santa Monica teenage surfing scene. By
1965 they were huge. Hit singles and albums made them as big -- and
arguably bigger -- than the Beatles.
Then Brian Wilson, the creative force behind the group, heard the
Beatles Rubber Soul album which moved him to record ''a whole album with
good stuff'', as he described it at the time. Through most of 1966 he
set about assembling a collection of his favourite sounds, his Pet
Sounds. It was and remains a masterpiece, but it was too far ahead of
its time. It was rock's first concept album, focusing on Wilson's
emotional conflicts as he moved towards the responsibilities of
adulthood. ''I guess I just wasn't made for these times,'' he sang --
and meant it.
But in 1966 rock music was pop music and pop music meant disposable
entertainment for kids. It was not considered art; it was seldom taken
seriously. Capitol, the Beach Boys' record company, reluctantly released
the album but failed to promote it, concentrating instead upon a
repackaged compilation, The Best of the Beach Boys.
Pet Sounds may have been an artistic triumph (inspiring Paul McCartney
to record Sergeant Pepper) but in Beach Boy terms it was a commercial
failure. More worryingly, the other members of the group were uncertain
about its direction, unsure about exactly where Brian Wilson was taking
them.
Now openly experimenting with LSD, he was taking them to even greater
heights with the mould-breaking single, Good Vibrations, which he called
his ''pocket symphony''. It became the group's top-selling single and
served temporarily to calm the rest of the group's fears.
Wilson began to believe he could make almost anything happen by the
force of his own creativity. He embarked upon his most ambitious project
to date, an album designed to express what he considered to be his
heaven-sent music and his outrageous sense of humour. Originally titled
Dumb Angel it was finally called Smile. And it would never be released.
With his new writing collaborator, Van Dyke Parks, a classically
trained arranger and musician, Wilson went off in an almost insane
search for the perfect rock album. At its heart was Heroes and Villains,
a brilliant song of breathtaking structure. It was perfection; sadly
what accompanied it was not. Many of the tracks were childlike, obscure,
and bizarre. A song about vegetables. Another about worms.
The worries of the other Beach Boys resurfaced as Wilson, like a man
possessed, continually re-arranged the pieces of the Smile jigsaw. He
began to act very strangely. At one point he placed his piano in a huge
sandbox which he'd had installed in his living room. The idea was to
feel the comfort of the beach between his toes as he played. As Parks
says in the documentary, the sandbox was fine until your feet discovered
that Brian's dogs had been using it as a toilet.
By the end of 1966, with the rest of the group touring Britain, Brian
Wilson finally lost both his confidence and his creative momentum. By
the turn of the year -- and with Sergeant Pepper only a few months away
-- he admitted defeat and cancelled the entire project.
Some of the tracks (Heroes and Villains, Vegetables, and Wind Chimes)
survived to appear on the subsequent Smiley Smile album while other
songs (including Surf's Up and Cabin Essence) featured on later albums.
Completely despondent and utterly destroyed, Brian retreated into a
world of psychosis and habitual substance abuse. The Beach Boys suffered
from his absence. They would never be the same again.
Wilson talks frankly about his past problems in the documentary. ''I
dropped out,'' he admits. ''I had experimented with too many drugs. They
really fouled my mind up. My thinking process was somewhere else. On and
off I'd go and record. Basically, I did about 10 years of bedroom
singing.''
* THIS week sees television's autumn schedules in full flight. The
ratings-desperate ITV disappointingly plays safe with the return of a
number of tried-and-tested popular dramas.
Top of the list is Carlton's Soldier Soldier (Tuesday) which sees
Private Dave Tucker (Robson Green) and Sergeant Paddy Garvey (Jerome
Flynn) -- surely the worst army singing duo since Windsor Davis and Don
Estelle -- back on parade with the rest of the King's Own Fusiliers.
In the great join-the-army-and-see-the-world tradition, they're off
this time for a spot of outback duty in Alice Springs and later on some
military manoeuvres in South Africa. In this week's opening episode
they're closer to home -- demonstrating hi-tech weapons to foreign arms
dealers under the command of a young and ambitious CO (Duncan Bell). But
there's a shock in store for Paddy when his ex-wife, now a Military
Police sergeant, arrives to investigate a shooting incident.
* BACK for its eighth series, LWT's London's Burning (Sunday) --
Soldier Soldier with fire hoses instead of rifles -- must surely be
approaching the end of its shelf life. The usual Blue Watch crew contend
with mugging, racist attacks, extramarital hanky-panky, and some
spectacular emergencies (including a bombing campaign, a warehouse fire,
lethal chemical leaks, and a blaze in a bedsit tenement). This week it's
a double-decker bus crash.
* AND the beat goes on in the insipid and formulaic Heartbeat
(Sunday), the television equivalent of taking too much sugar in your
tea. Much better is Class Act (Thursday) a second series for Carlton's
engaging comedy drama featuring the thinking man's old boiler, Joanna
Lumley, as the financially-challenged dangerous lady, Kate Swift.
* FOOTBALL would appear to be television's new rock and roll. Hot on
the heels of last week's uneven comedy from BBC Scotland, Atletico
Partick, and C4's brilliant Eleven Men Against Eleven, comes The Perfect
Match (ITV Wednesday), a one-off romantic comedy film set against the
backdrop of the 1995 FA Cup Final. Soccer-daft Phil (Con O'Neill from
Moving Story) proposes to his girlfriend Bridget (Saskia Reeves) by
flashing a ''Will you marry me?'' message up on the electronic
scoreboard at Wembley. Events overtake the couple when the tabloid
newspapers catch on and dub them Britain's most romantic couple.
* MEANWHILE, back at the Beeb, the launch of a potentially powerful
new cop drama series Backup (BBC1, Thursday) about an elite
(Birmingham-based) Support Unit which helps the rest of the polis out
when they're busy. In the first episode the nine-strong team is
dispatched to a lonely farm where detectives believe the bodies of six
murdered teenage girls are buried. Scots actor Sean Scanlan (Rab C
Nesbitt, Para Handy, and soon to be seen on the big screen in David
Hayman's Glasgow thriller The Near Room) makes a guest appearance as the
murder suspect.
* THERE'S an intriguing premise to Rich Deceiver (BBC1, Saturday), a
two-part romantic comedy starring Lesley Dunlop and John McArdle. A
Liverpool housewife scoops a #2m pools jackpot -- and decides not to
tell her disillusioned and out-of-work husband. Instead she decides
secretly to invest the cash in a company which will give her man a sales
job -- and thereby give him back his self-respect. It all goes
pear-shaped when the husband starts to go away on ''business trips'' and
leaves her alone and bored at home.
* BACK for a second series this week is the quirky American
fish-out-of-water drama series, Due South (BBC1, Tuesday), featuring
Canada's greatest crime-fighting export, Mountie Benton Fraser (Paul
Gross). In ''The Man Who Knew Too Little'' Fraser and Vecchio (David
Marciano) have to escort a pathological liar back to Canada. But a bunch
of bad guys don't want Pinnochio to reach his destination and, when they
try to ambush Vecchio's car, Fraser decides to take to the back roads.
* FINALLY this week Mel and Griff make a welcome return after a
three-year absence for a new series of Smith and Jones (BBC1,
Wednesday). As wickedly funny and gloriously tasteless as ever, the pair
succeed where comedy contemporaries Fry and Lawrie failed (their recent
sketch series was a disaster because it was too damned clever by half).
Brilliant.

BEGGARS, even beggars with bombs, cannot be choosers. For this reason
Britain, as one of the world's oldest nuclear powers but without the
wherewithal to test the devices, has had to bow to decisions reached in
Washington and, most curiously, Paris. With understandable ill-grace,
the Ministry of Defence indicated yesterday that it is likely that
Britain will end all nuclear testing and rely instead on computer
simulation technology to provide details on how best to maintain and
improve our nuclear arsenal. The Ministry, which has always argued that
any blanket ban on even low fission yield tests would be a serious
limitation on necessary freedom of manoeuvre, has had to bow to the
inevitable. All British nuclear devices have been tested in the United
States because we do not have our own testing site. The US test range in
Nevada has been closed for the past three years because of a moratorium
and, after a brief spell of opposition from the Pentagon, President
Clinton stamped his presidential foot and declared that the United
States would henceforth aim for a ''true zero test ban'', which
translates as no more testing.
The problem in this for Britain was compounded by an inability to
point an accusing finger at the French who are just about to start a
series of eight test explosions at Mururoa Atoll in the South Pacific.
In the face of widespread international complaint France has twisted and
squirmed. The French were inured to protests from the South Pacific
region, but the condemnation of the Swedes and particularly the Germans
took them by surprise. The reaction from Paris has been to offer in
vague terms the possibility that France might one day put its nuclear
arsenal at the service of European allies. This is not a new idea and
neither is it an attractive one. The French may make potentially grand
gestures but nobody believes that Paris would ever surrender the
slightest smidgeon of control over its nuclear devices. Nor is French
nuclear protection wanted, especially as the bulk of European allies are
content to rest under the umbrella positioned and still held in place by
the United States. But France, even with the latest series of tests, has
promised to support a comprehensive test ban when the series is
completed. This is more than Britain had done, until yesterday.
The British nuclear deterrent, if we should wish to keep it, can only
be maintained in useable condition if regular tests and maintenance are
made. With all conventional methods of testing ruled out it was
necessary to find an alternative. Fortunately the Americans, who are
anxious to avoid the dangers of nuclear proliferation, have been working
hard on developing computer simulation tests which make an actual
explosion redundant. It is likely that Washington has already agreed to
share much of this equipment and expertise with Britain, although the
Ministry of Defence in particular is not likely to enthuse about this
option. The implication of the decisions made by the United States,
France, Russia, Britain, and possibly China is that the end of physical
testing of nuclear devices will make a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty
worthy of the name that much more likely. The development by Britain of
a new generation of nuclear warheads is almost impossible now, but this
is not necessarily the tragedy which is suggested by the more vigorous
proponents of nuclear weapons. Quite simply, the decision taken by
President Clinton, which has reverberated throughout the nuclear club
and which has now been acknowledged by Britain, makes the need for new
generations of nuclear weapons less necessary.

IT IS probably sufficient to know that this week's X Files (BBC2,
Monday) was directed by one David Nutter. It is also enough to say that
the spooky, simultaneous transmission of Secret History's The Roswell
Incident (C4) provided scant evidence of UFOs, pointing instead to the
usual balloons.
Granted, the balloons spoke with conviction, not least the oldsters
who swear an object bumped into the New Mexico desert in 1947.
Something, we know not what, dropped from the sky, and something was
covered up by the military. Government paranoia -- not quite an
oxymoron, but close -- bred public paranoia. Harassed by sinister
soldiers, ordinary folk drew their own conclusions. Ordinary folk do.
Secret History worked hard to arrive at a ''Not proven'' verdict,
largely, we must guess, because it wasn't worth a used Acme
Disintegrator Gun on any other terms. It expended a good deal of time on
footage alleged to have been shot at the autopsy of one of the 4ft
humanoids ''recovered'' from the wreck. Since the pictures had the
technical merit of a Dr Who out-take, however, this was but one more
small step for idiotkind and a reverse triple somersault for
credibility.
Ask yourself, since the programme preferred not to, why after almost
50 years the US government has utilised none of the neato, alien zap
rays and faster-than-FedEx technology of the ''flying disc'. More to the
point, ask who really believes the Americans, of all people, could keep
such a thing secret. The truth is out there, but conspiracy nuts
everywhere are doing their best to make sure we don't find out how dull
it is.
Besides, as Mulder again demonstrated, ET isn't short and tubby but
kind of svelte, tallish, and bathed permanently in the glare of handy
portable arc lamps. Equally -- and this may be their weakness, professor
-- the creature is incapable of entering a room. Some hidden force --
call it the effects budget -- means he never advances beyond the door
while performing the trick with the exploding light sockets.
The new X Files pushed the tension up a notch by making it plain that
everyone and everything is now out to get old Fox with the possible
exception -- though how can he be sure? -- of Scully, who kinda loves
the kook but can't bring herself to say so while the bullets and cliches
are flying.
This almost makes you forget black holes in the script. Thus, if
Mulder is such a threat to the cover-up that a government ''alien
recovery'' squad is spraying him with small-arms fire, why aren't his
FBI bosses, who know the score, evacuating his brains with a .45mm?
Watching this stuff you begin to wonder about your susceptibilities.
Is it funny? Sort of. Is it well done? By its lights. Is it worth
spending three-quarters of an hour on? Only if you grant that people
will never grow out of fairy tales and never lose the childish belief
that supernatural forces alone can explain even half of what goes on in
the average day.
For example, it is obvious that Anthea Turner (TV-am and Lottery draws
passim) is but the advance guard for the Attack from Planet Numpty, her
mission to so enfeeble humanity's cerebella that no-one will wonder why
she is being paid #600,000 a year to talk balls (numbered ones) and
shave a man's legs on television. Nato might be dicing Serbs but it is
far more important that we witness Anthea gibbering on the Costas each
morning. The inane, you might say, in Spain.
But of such, godlike beings from another dimension help us all, are
ratings made. Just to ram home the point, Eamonn Holmes, Anthea's screen
swain, dissipated an hour and a half on Wednesday with The National
Television Awards: The Viewer's Choice (ITV), an event not unconnected,
you suspect, with the fact that advertisers are fed up with the dismal
performance of the third channel.
Though the BBC was allowed to join the party, the purpose seemed to be
to boost ratings by inviting viewers to vote on a limited selection of
already highly-rated shows. Or have conspiracy theories got the better
of me? Passing the buck to ''you, the viewer'' was a neat way of
ensuring that crap became its own justification. We'll show you rubbish;
now tell us what your very favourite piece of garbage is and we'll give
it a really awful-looking prize.
The event was enlivened only by the appearance of a dignified Michael
Barrymore, a funny man who deserves every prize going, not least since
his courage has recently provided an excuse for every vicious little
mother in the country to join the queue to hoist the first stone. If
aliens aren't to blame for the malignities around, the Lord has a lot to
answer for. But hey, that's entertainment.
As was, thankfully, Eleven Men Against Eleven (C4, Thursday), a drama
that fell easily off a log by making football seem even funnier than it
already is. Timothy West, as the pig-eyed ''Sir Bob'', robber baron of a
toiling premiership side, partnered James Bolam's ageing soccer romantic
with the aplomb of a veteran midfield dynamo. Up front were a cast of
dopehead players, crooked agents, racist fans inadvertently beating up
the club's star black player, and the avenging angel of the Inland
Revenue.
The temptation must have been to go full-pelt, not least because of
the steady flow of inch-perfect jokes which Andy Hamilton's script
provided for the players. This side were too good for that. Instead,
they gave us a measured passing game, always controlling the pace and
making the shots tell. A splendid example of comedy teamwork, in fact.
Beside it Ian Pattison's Atletico Partick AFC (BBC1, Monday) was
indeed struggling in the Sunday leagues. There was a hint of better
things in this pilot (television's equivalent of a trial with the
reserves) but why use caricature when the real thing is daft in itself?
The jokes were good -- ''Intae him, lads! He's vulnerable! His marriage
is in trouble!'' -- but the finishing, in terms of structure, just a
little shaky.
Jack Docherty's Mac (BBC2, Friday) meanwhile parodied all those
patriots quick to stereotype cricket-loving English folk and other forms
of enemy. Docherty first developed the character in an Absolutely skit
but here he has mutated into the full, foaming bigot whose only mission
in life is personally to fulfil every last injunction of the Declaration
of Arbroath.
Very funny, even if it, too, is caricature, isn't it?

THE Abbey National's unexpected mortgage reduction may not kick-start
the housing market but it is the clearest sign yet that the Chancellor's
view that the UK interest rate cycle has peaked enjoys major
institutional support. Those who criticise the Abbey's move on the
grounds that it is unfocused, by appealing to all its customers rather
than new ones, miss two important points. First, it is stealing the lead
again -- and confounding all those who keep, wrongly, insisting that the
mutual building societies automatically offer the cheapest lending
rates. It is therefore buying enormous publicity on the cheap. Secondly,
it is looking to the existing customer base because it knows there is a
deep-seated resentment among existing mortgage payers at the way in
which all benefits are at present targeted on new entrants to the
housing market. In the coming battles in the mortgage market, which are
forecast to be intense, the Abbey is buying loyalty in advance. It does
not seem an unwise strategy.
From a wider point of view there is the encouragement this move --
which will have to be followed by the Abbey's major competitors --
affords the Chancellor. The evidence has accumulated since May that his
refusal to raise the cost of money was justified by more than partisan
calculation (though he did take a risk); but most comment has been
extremely cautious in insisting that the most that was possible was for
base rates to be held. There now must be the possibility that a
downwards shift is in sight. It need not be great: Mr Clarke himself has
pioneered movements as modest as a quarter of a percentage point, but
any move will be welcome. Alternatively, he might, after all, be able to
contemplate income tax cuts in his next Budget without having to raise
interest rates simultaneously to counter any inflationary effects. That
will be music to Tory ears, even if there is every possibility that
popular political sentiment has become insulated from all but very
dramatic economic and financial news.
It may be too much for the Tory back benchers to thole, but the
possibility of cheaper money could allow the Government to proceed
without reducing its spending programmes at all. The pressures on
spending departments to trim their budgets to create room for tax cuts
(to which any improved revenues seem also likely to be diverted) is
being resisted by some Ministers, notably Mr Dorrell at Health. Nearly
every department of state could usefully spend more, and Mr Clarke has
taken great care to moderate his promises of tax cuts and give priority
to balancing the public finances. The Prime Minister's supporting line
that tax cuts will only be made when justified by prudence is also worth
recalling in this context. It is possible cheaper money will have as
much appeal as marginal tax reductions coupled with higher public
spending in priority areas. This should be the Government's preferred
strategy.
It may not be possible for the Chancellor to implement it all the
same. Political reality in the shape of back bench panic about poor
chances of individual re-election could force his hand. Yet it is too
easily assumed that he has no room for manoeuvre within his existing
pattern of revenues and taxes. A further swing to indirect taxes
(British VAT rates are among the lowest in the EU) could be coupled with
changes in the more psychologically important taxes on income. Of course
that would be a gamble, and it may not be popular at all, but suddenly
it looks as if a Chancellor who was boxed in, has enough room to shake
the dice. And Mr Clarke has something of the gambler's instinct.

Chris Dobson joins the farewell to a Scotsman who has helped make Hong
Kong's financial status the envy of the world
SIR Hamish Macleod ended his role as the last British Financial
Secretary of Hong Kong this week when he retired from the Government in
preparation to move to Edinburgh -- and into two new directorships.
A wiry, bespectacled Scotsman with a passion for tennis -- he has been
a regular playing partner with Governor Chris Patten -- Sir Hamish's
demure character belies the power he has just relinquished.
During his tenure, which began in August 1991, he helped fend off the
global recession which has yet to strike the territory, and boosted the
Government's reserves to a level many other developed countries can only
hope to achieve.
Over the past four years Hong Kong has become the goose that laid a
golden egg in the form of a #30bn budget surplus -- that includes a
special handover fund -- which will be inherited by China in less than
two years.
On a number of occasions he also took on the mantle of world leader
when he represented the Government at regional and Pacific rim
conferences, including two such events with American President Bill
Clinton. But at 55, Sir Hamish has opted for early retirement to make
way for Donald Tsang, who becomes the first local Chinese to hold the
post and who will keep the job through the transition to Beijing rule on
July 1, 1997, although it has not been confirmed beyond the handover.
He will take up at least two ''non-executive directorships'' at
Scottish Oriental Smaller Companies Fund and Highland Distillers.
Sir Hamish has also been short-listed as an adviser for an arbitration
body with the World Trade Organisation. At a farewell reception
yesterday with the journalists who have dogged him during his four-year
stint as Financial Secretary, he stuck to his prudent trademark of not
discussing sensitive issues.
''In a funny way I will miss the media,'' he said during a toast
yesterday.
He would not give any hints about how he manages his own finances, but
told journalists that he did not keep a diary and would not be putting
pen to paper to write his memoirs.
And true to form, Sir Hamish did not veer from the chosen subject of
the day, his retirement, declining to reveal any of the secrets of the
job, although he did discuss how he is portrayed in public.
''I am in a great mood on my first post-retirement day,'' Sir Hamish
said.
''I think I like 95% of the cartoons and nicknames about me in the
media -- Sir Generous, Sir Prudent and Super Surplus. They are good and
alright.''
Prudent is a common description, although most of his contemporaries
are more blunt off the record and call him boring but efficient.
An editorial this week in the territory's leading English-language
newspaper, the South China Morning Post, generally praised his financial
leadership but faulted him, as others have, for being ''too prudent''.
''At a time of unprecedented prosperity -- his four budgets were
marked by continual embarrassment over higher-than-expected surpluses --
he arguably could have been generous with the Government's #13bn
reserves,'' the paper stated.
''But being cautious has its merits at a time when the uncertainties
surrounding the 1997 handover make economic stability more essential
than ever.''
Sir Hamish said he had no regrets over his policies, especially in the
curbs he instituted against price hikes in the residential property
market, which subsequently cooled down.
He is also confident that Hong Kong's now sluggish economy will regain
its sparkle again by the end of the year and that he will continue to
follow its path through future ups and downs.
''There's the danger of over-reacting to economic statistics,'' he
said. ''Unemployment is one, though I'm not saying that doesn't matter.
But we need to look at other figures to get a balanced picture. People
tend to focus on the down side.''
As well as taking to the tennis court and boardroom in his retirement,
Sir Hamish has also booked a return flight to the territory for a party
being thrown by a wealthy businessman on June 30, 1997.
And in keeping with his nature, he refused to disclose who is hosting
the end-of-empire bash.

YOUR editorial and report headlined ''Bridge to Bute the only way . .
.'' present a very one-sided view of the problem (August 26).
If the experience of the tolls proposed for the Skye bridge are any
guide no-one needs delude themselves that a bridge will be any cheaper,
and the environmental impact on what is one of the most beautiful and
accessible areas of the west coast of Scotland would be devastating.
One should also consider the enormous capital cost of both the bridge
and the approach roads, some 40 miles of them, which would all have to
be improved to carry the increased traffic which the bridge would
generate.
Aside from the long-term pollution costs of that increased traffic,
the Bute residents should also realise that their present freedom from
serious crime would end the day the bridge opens.
Roads and bridges cost money to maintain, the sea is free.
All those factors suggest that the building of a bridge is certainly
not the only way.
The problem would not exist if the management of CalMac were in the
least sensitive to the enormous amount of criticism which has been and
is being directed at them. Their results are inefficient and their
outlook arrogant.
If the CalMac spokesman claimed that there had been no complaints then
one can only conclude that he is deaf.
He made much of the option of the savings from 10-journey tickets but
did not mention that his company does not accept them at weekends. The
services to Bute and their pricing have been a source of bitter
complaint as long as I can remember.
In that CalMac is a state-owned company the final responsibility for
its operation lies with the Secretary of State. It is up to him either
to improve the present management or privatise it or provide inducements
for a competing service.
The ferry services on the Clyde have steadily deteriorated over the
past 80 years as more and more money has been poured into road
transport, resulting in poorer and poorer transport links.

''I know what I'm doing; time and results will judge my work''
MOST families have a black sheep, the Brown family had Craig, the man
charged with the responsibility of protecting a nation's hopes on the
football field. Football management can be an almost impossible task and
certainly a thankless one, but in Brown's case it is a constant struggle
to be understood.
The Scottish national team manager, like his predecessor Andy
Roxburgh, who is now in his element travelling the world spreading the
coaching gospel as technical director of UEFA (European football's
governing body), started at a distinct disadvantage. From the day he was
appointed manager on November 1993, two hours before Scotland played
Malta in a World Cup qualifying tie, the fans were unhappy.
They changed easily from asking ''Andy Who?'' to ''Craig who?''.
Unrest among the ranks was widespread, the foot soldiers of the Tartan
Army who felt their years of loyalty deserved a more seasoned general;
they talked of desertion. They wanted someone with a reputation which
travelled before him -- a Kenny Dalglish or an Alex Ferguson, but
instead the mandarins of Bleak House, the SFA's Park Gardens
headquarters, gave them ''another schoolteacher''.
There were murmurings within the game also by some of the club
managers, but they were mostly dinosaurs who still had hang-ups about
coaching. They shook their heads and were generally disparaging. In
fact, in the first months of Brown's reign it seemed as though fellow
managers, and also players, were queueing up to denigrate. He was
condemned a failure before he had time to settle into his role.
He became another target of narrow-minded professionals who believe
the true measure of a man can be found only in the number of medals he
has in the drawers at home, and organised, level-headed coaches were to
be dismissed. In the mould of his father Hugh -- ''a hammer-thrower of a
footballer'' his manager son said -- Craig Brown signed for Rangers as a
teenager, but Jim Baxter was brought in to play left-half and an Ibrox
career died before it had a chance.
He went to Dundee and then on to Falkirk before the condition of his
right knee, which has been operated on five times, forced him off the
pitch for good. Having never been a top performer he was never given
credence as a coach or a manager, and the sniping and often cruel lack
of appreciation has continued ever since. Even the prospect of
qualification for the European Championship finals in England next
summer has failed to squeeze a drop of human kindness from the
54-year-old's critics.
A few nights ago he landed on the helipad of a North Sea oil rig to
keep a speaking engagement and as he made his way across the platform
wrapped in his yellow oilskins he passed a gang of roustabouts as a
Mash-like announcement blared through the Tannoy system: ''Remember,
tonight in the cinema the Scotland national team manager, Craig Brown,
will give a presentation.''
Without even looking up one of the oil workers said through gritted
teeth: ''Brown? Sack the bastard.''
Even if he had been aware that the new arrival in the oilskins was
Brown his response would probably have been the same because it has
become fashionable among football fans to abuse Brown, just as they did
Roxburgh, who had to leave his own country before his expertise in the
world of coaching could be fully appreciated. However, criticism of
Roxburgh was not quite as stinging or deliberate.
Once when Roxburgh was on a flight across the Atlantic at the end of a
family holiday, another woman started chatting to his wife and
throughout the flight kept saying Roxburgh's face was familiar. ''I'm
sure I know your husband,'' she repeated until, when they were filing
off the aircraft, she tapped Roxburgh on the shoulder and announced: ''I
do know you. Do you drive an ice-cream van in Bishopbriggs?''
Brown would never cringe in the face of such honest put-downs simply
because, after so many attacks on him by managers, players, supporters,
and newspapers, people know who he is. Apart from an attempt to disguise
thinning hair by combing what remains forward, he is as honest as they
come in football's Machiavellian world.
By now the criticism and abuse he has received would have broken most
managers, but Brown survives and is still smiling. Indeed, if Scotland
beat Finland in a European qualifying tie at Hampden on Wednesday night
he will enjoy the last laugh because his team will have secured their
place in England and his record as national team manager will be better
than any of his predecessors, including Jock Stein, Ferguson, and Tommy
Docherty, who is particularly scathing about Brown.
His success rate is just under 70% while Docherty's stands at 66%,
Stein's at 53%, and Ferguson finished on 50%. No-one can argue with
that, yet Brown is still denied the recognition his work and his methods
merit; not that he is complaining. Anyone who learned the managerial
ropes at Shawfield as Clyde's manager learns quickly that some in this
world are destined to suffer slings and arrows.
Just after Clyde had made him a director/manager of their club, the
team played Morton and after having been 3-0 up at half time Brown's
side lost 4-3. As he made his way towards the dressing room a voice from
the crowd shouted: ''Haw Broon, now that you're a director how about
getting us a new manager.''
He is aware of the things said about him, but he never worries. ''I
know what I'm doing; time and results will judge my work, although
sometimes other people are given a rude awakening when they mistake my
courtesy for weakness.''
The Scottish fans believed Roxburgh, who like Brown was a
schoolteacher, was a weak manager and they say the same about the
current incumbent, but they don't know the full story -- they don't know
the man either.
Brown, because he realises it isn't necessary to turn red in the face
and scream at people before they will do things his way, suffers because
he is different. There are times when he feels like taking people by the
throat but he holds back, then makes sure that anyone who harms him
deliberately is not allowed another opportunity to inflict damage.
Everton's #4m striker Duncan Ferguson was sent home from an under-21
squad gathering because he flouted rules, and Richard Gough, arguably
Scotland's best central defender, has been banished to the international
wilderness because he was openly critical of the management. Brown
calmly resists every attempt to bring the Rangers captain back into the
fold, yet he is careful never to criticise the player in public.
When sure of his ground he stands firm, but that is not to say he is
intransigent. A few weeks ago Andy Goram said he was unable to play in
goal against Greece in a crucial European Championship qualifying tie
because his mind wasn't focused properly and Brown, while seething,
accepted the keeper's reason and allowed him to leave.
When the Rangers player was named in the squad for the game against
Finland the fans saw this as another sign of Brown's weakness, but what
they were unaware of was that the manager knew the real story behind
Goram's decision not to play. If the keeper was thinking of something
else, like Rangers' European Cup tie against Anorthosis Famagusta of
Cyprus, then he wouldn't have been tuned to Scotland's task.
Brown is always aware of what is going on when players call off from
international duty, and despite what they or their clubs may say, they
do withdraw because of club commitments. This is a problem every
international manager has to face and so far none of them has been able
to prevent this kind of drain on resources.
Brown makes a point of letting players and managers know he is on to
them, which is more than his predecessors did.
There is no doubt he has a way with people, perhaps a skill perfected
in the classroom; when a knee problem -- not to mention a lack of skill
-- convinced him his fortune would not be earned chasing a bag of wind,
he took an Open University degree and became a teacher and then a
lecturer at Craigie College, and although he hasn't taken class for 25
years he remembers how to cajole the best from people around him.
A limited squad of internationalists has lost only once in their past
11 matches and while they are still reluctant to praise him, the masses
are being won over. Brown is emerging as a manager of some stature even
though it baffles the fans that they have a leader who doesn't shout
from the rooftops. An alien in the football world.
Before his evening on the oil rig was out Brown had won a few more
friends.
He uses reason and logic and travels the country meeting fans and
critics, not because he wants to be loved but because he would like to
be understood. Only Brown would have gone out into the North Sea and
walk among the hostiles with an attitude which belies the weight of his
task, which would crush a truly weak man.
He knows his decisions can affect the happiness of countless
thousands, from the unemployed to the rich because football touches all
classes, but he doesn't lose any sleep. ''You have to understand that at
my age I didn't take this job as a career move,'' he said. ''This will
be my last job in management and I also know that I will be the SFA's
technical director until I'm 60, so there is nothing to worry about.''
Stories about Brown's attempts to treat highly paid footballers like
schoolchildren abound, but most can be dismissed as malicious gossip
because the fact is almost all of his players have grown to respect his
efforts. They also know, contrary to popular misconception, that he can
be hard. Players do it his way or they don't play, although he tries not
to smother individual flair.
Knowing his task is almost impossible, in that no mortal could satisfy
the expectations of the Scottish support, he carries on in his own
studious way, planning and plotting a route to the finals of another
major competition.
The oldest of three brothers born in Corkerhill, he could say fate
left him with the toughest of professions while his brothers Bob and
Jock became minister of Queen's Cross Chuch in Aberdeen, and a lawyer
and broadcaster respectively.
''Bob has three degrees from universities including one in North
Carolina, Jock is an MA from Cambridge, I'm a BA from the Open
University,'' he said. ''As a footballer I was the one the manager would
turn to last and say, 'right son, nothing clever from you this week'.''
No matter how it all pans out for Brown he will remain proud of his
contribution, knowing he maintained his own levels of decency and
intelligence in the mad and greedy world of football. If he can come out
of this smiling he will indeed have won.

CUSTOMERS of Bank of Scotland's Home and Office Banking Service (HOBS)
must be wondering why Barclays Bank is making such a fuss about the new
personal computer based banking service which it is launching in the
autumn. After all, HOBS customers have been enjoying computer banking
for the last 10 years.
The trouble with technology is that being at the leading edge doesn't
necessarily give you a big marketing advantage. HOBS was always a
wonderful invention. The ability to call up your bank account and have
it displayed on a terminal in your own home, pay bills, change standing
orders and make transfers between accounts was superficially very
attractive. But in the early days only committed computer buffs were
prepared to pay for it.
The service was then relaunched with the aim of attracting businesses
which needed access to their bank accounts outside banking hours. Last
year it had another go at attracting personal customers with the launch
of the HOBS screenphone, a specially adapted telephone with a small
computer screen. This allows Bank of Scotland customers to access their
bank and credit card accounts and carry out all the transactions
available through the long-standing PC-based HOBS service. The phone
costs #99 to buy or #3 a month to rent.
Now the Bank of Scotland is hoping to beat Barclays into PC banking.
Spokesman David Ball says it aims to be the first to offer a full
on-line, interactive service in a Windows environment. ''The service
will be introduced to members of staff and keen HOBS users on an
experimental basis in the autumn,'' he explains.
Barclays has said very little about its new PC service beyond the fact
that it will be available in the last quarter of the year to anyone with
a Barclays account and will enable customers to pay bills, obtain
interim statements, make balance enquiries, set up and alter standing
orders and transfer funds.
Customers who sign up for the service in the initial research phase
won't have to pay anything but will help Barclays fine tune the
operation to meet customers' needs.
The bank has obviously taken the decision that the number of personal
computers linked to the telephone network through a modem is high enough
to justify the investment. However, so far only 2000 customers have
registered and the vast majority of these are men, which seems to
indicate that PC banking still has only minority appeal.
It makes you wonder what is happening to the computers which are being
bought for the home. Recent research shows that one in seven homes now
have a computer and nearly half of these are regularly used for work or
business. Computers are now the top selling consumer durable in the UK
with more than 3200 homes acquiring one each day. But how many people
are defeated by the technicalities of getting them up and running?
Daryl Booth, Barclays' head of delivery channel development, argues
that PCs are not difficult to deal with. ''People are no longer going to
specialist retailers. They are now widely sold in the High Street and
they come ready to use. The software is already installed. All you have
to do is take them out of the box and plug them in. But our research
also showed us that there is an earlier generation of PC users which
feels banks have not kept up with their technological needs and
abilities.''
Barclays may not be the first UK bank to explore the potential of the
PC, but it is well ahead of the competition when it comes to the much
hyped internet. Earlier this year it launched an electronic shopping
mall, BarclaySquare, which allows the one million UK internet users to
order from Argos, Sainsbury and Toys 'R' Us, among others. And
Barclaycard has an internet address for information and electronic mail.
Ronald Brown, editor of electronic banking newsletter Post-News, says
timing is crucial with new technology. ''There is rarely anything to be
gained from being the first. Companies need to start exploiting the
technology just before it becomes commonplace, and even then, they may
have a long wait before it starts earning them any money. In the UK,
no-one is expected to make any money out of PC banking and offering
financial and shopping services over the internet until around the turn
of the century, by which time it is expected the volumes will have
become significant.''
There is also the problem of security. Who in their right mind would
be happy pumping the most intimate details of their finances out into
the ether, unless they could be sure no-one, apart from their bank,
could read them?
No bank will ever be able to guarantee absolute security. And in this
day and age keeping gold bullion under your mattress is the only way to
ensure that you don't fall victim to the science fiction nightmare of an
electronic apocalypse, with the world's financial systems brought down
by the ultimate computer virus.
Experts don't know whether or not to be reassured by the news that it
recently took one French PhD student eight days, 120 computers and a
powerful mainframe to decode Netscape's encryption code -- the one used
by BarclaySquare -- but only to the extent of obtaining a single credit
card number.
At the moment the world divides sharply into two camps. You are either
computer literate and fanatical or you are computer phobic. It's a fair
guess that PC banking and the internet can only come into their own when
the current generation of schoolchildren, who have grown up with
computers, and treat them simply as useful tools, need to start
organising their finances.
Barclays' PC Banking has a free helpline on 0800 100 123. Its internet
address is http://www.barclaycard.co.uk BarclaySquare's internet address

THERE has been a great deal of coverage in the past few weeks of the
change in tax treatment of options granted under Inland Revenue approved
share option schemes. Most of the attention has focused on options in
quoted companies, but that is not necessarily where the biggest
difficulty lies.
While those holding quoted options can exercise them and sell the
shares for cash, those who hold their shares in unquoted companies face
the problem of not having a ready market in which to sell them so they
can pay the tax bill. As the changes announced on July 17 and revised 10
days later apply to those already participating in schemes, they could
damage businesses which have relied on them to motivate their staff.
There are, however, other ways to acquire shares in the company you
work for. Not all of these schemes have favourable tax status, but if
certain conditions are met there can be a tax saving. With the uproar
over the withdrawal of income tax relief for approved share option
schemes, if you participate in one that doesn't carry tax reliefs you
could be forgiven for thinking you're missing out. But this may not be
the case.
Inland Revenue approved profit sharing schemes and save-as-you-earn
schemes are not affected by the changes announced in July. These,
therefore, remain an effective way of giving employees a tax-free
benefit.
A profit sharing scheme involves the establishment of a trust which
holds shares on your behalf. The company makes cash contributions and
obtains tax relief for these. The trustees then acquire shares in the
company and allocate them to you and your fellow workers. Shares valued
at up to #8000 at the time of acquisition, or 10% of salary if greater,
can be held in the trust for up to five years to qualify for favourable
tax treatment. If they are held for the full period, you receive them
free of income tax; if held for four to five years, you pay 75% of the
income tax due. Capital gains tax is payable on any gain you make on
eventual disposal.
In a save-as-you-earn scheme, you enter into a savings contract, for
example a building society or bank share save scheme, and save a fixed
amount over five years. An option is granted at the outset to acquire as
many shares as your total savings and bonus under the savings contract
will allow. The price at which they can be bought is set at 80% of the
market value at the time the option is granted. You don't pay income tax
when the option is exercised, but capital gains tax is payable on
disposal of the shares. Another income tax benefit is that bonuses
payable under the savings contract are tax free.
There are good reasons for using share schemes that do not rely on
Inland Revenue approval. While you pay income tax on any benefits
obtained, unapproved schemes are not subject to so many restrictions.
For example, in an approved scheme, after exercising options you would
have to wait three years before exercising any others. There is no such
limitation on unapproved schemes.
The recent debate over executive pay has accelerated the trend for
attaching performance targets to employee share rewards. These can range
from increases in the company's share price to productivity targets and
comparison of performance with other staff or competitors.
A number of organisations have carried out studies which appear to
support the contention that firms with employee share ownership plans
(ESOPs) achieve improved performance because of better motivation,
commitment and loyalty.
One study by the ESOP Centre found the average increase in share price
of companies with an ESOP was 43% a year. Another, carried out by the
Centre for Economic Performance of the London School of Economics, found
that work places with any form of profit sharing or employee share
ownership scheme had a better productivity.
Employee share ownership is gaining support from both sides of the
political spectrum. Sir George Young, when he was Financial Secretary to
the Treasury, commented that one of the central components of effective
employee involvement was the ability to offer them a direct stake in the
ownership of the employing organisation. Alistair Darling, Labour's City
spokesman, has come out in favour of ESOPs too, commenting that they
improve motivation and foster the culture of ownership rather than the
culture of shareholders.
If care is taken over the structure of an ESOP, employees at
executive, managerial or operational level can be motivated more
effectively. The arrangements can also be set up to provide benefits of
greater value to employees at a reduced cost to the employer.
So, while mixed messages may be coming out of the Treasury, there is
still enough scope under existing rules to deliver an effective and
tax-efficient share scheme to employees.

MANWEB said yesterday it was in no rush to spell out its defence
against ScottishPower's hostile #1000m takeover bid following the
Government's decision not to refer it to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission.
But the Chester-based regional electricity company said it was
preparing a package of benefits for loyal shareholders substantially
different from that offered by Northern earlier this year to fend off a
grab by Trafalgar House.
''I don't think we are going to see anything in the next few days,'' a
Manweb spokeswoman said.
But she added: ''It is going to be very different from anything
anybody has seen so far. It's not going to be like Northern. It is going
to be very different.''
In January, Northern promised its shareholders #5 per share in special
dividends, National Grid shares, preference shares regular dividend
growth to thwart an #11 bid by Trafalgar House.
So far, Manweb has only said that it will offer its 118,000
shareholders a package including unspecified cash payments and Manweb's
share entitlement in the National Grid.
But it is unlikely to do anything before hearing what ScottishPower
says to its own shareholders at an extraordinary meeting in Glasgow on
Monday to gain approval for the bid.
Manweb is legally obliged to spell out a defence strategy aimed at
pushing its own share price beyond the reach of ScottishPower by
September 15.
But there is a widespread feeling among City analysts that the
Chester-based utility is fishing for an improved offer from
ScottishPower rather than seriously fighting to stay independent.
ScottishPower has offered a cash-plus-shares package worth 985[1/2]p
at yesterday's closing prices -- slightly more than Manweb's closing
price of 978p.
There is as an all-cash alternative of 915p.
The Manweb spokeswoman predicted that Manweb shares would rocket
beyond their present level once the defence package is revealed, but she
admitted that if ScottishPower improves its offer the Chester-based
utility may capitulate.
''If the right level of bid is offered by ScottishPower they have a
duty to shareholders to accept and the directors cannot avoid that,''
she said.
Richard Andrews, an analyst with Edinburgh brokers Bell Lawrie White,
said a small improvement in ScottishPower's offer should tip the
balance.
''I suspect they may need to raise their bid a bit, perhaps to #10,
it's hard to say,'' he said.
But ScottishPower, which already owns 14.9% of Manweb and has received
acceptances for a further 5%, is likely to sit tight with its present
offer until Manweb reveals its hand.
Manweb's room for manouevre runs out on September 15, but
ScottishPower can improve its own bid after that deadline if necessary.
However, at 985[1/2]p its present offer compares favourably with
Hanson's agreed 975p bid for Eastern and Southern Company's improved bid
of 965p for South Western (Sweb), which persuaded the Sweb board to drop
its opposition.
Industry sources said Manweb chief executive John Roberts was furious
with Sweb for failing to drive a tougher bargain.

SIR Hamish MacLeod, who retired as financial secretary in Hong Kong
earlier this week, has picked up two company directorships in Scotland
even before his return to Edinburgh, writes ROBERT POWELL.
Sir Hamish, 55, has been appointed a non-executive director of
Highland Distilleries, the makers of Famous Grouse and malts such as
Highland Park and Bunnahabhain.
With 29 years of experience in Hong Kong behind him, he is also
joining the board of Stewart Ivory's Scottish Oriental Smaller Companies
Trust. This #26m trust was set up in March to invest in smaller
companies throughout Asia, but Hong Kong firms are the backbone of its
portfolio.
Ivor Guild, chairman of Scottish Oriental, knew Sir Hamish personally
and recommended his appointment to the board. ''He had met him in Hong
Kong and said that he would be a suitable addition and we concur
entirely,'' said Stewart Ivory chairman James Ferguson.
Sir Hamish's specialist knowledge of the Far East will also be
appreciated at Highland Distilleries, which like other whisky firms is
experiencing strong sales growth in Asia. ''We became aware that he was
returning to the UK and thought that he would be a most appropriate
person,'' said company secretary Alan Mitchelson.
Under Sir Hamish's stewardship, the Hong Kong economy has grown by 25%
over the last five years. Despite his nickname ''Sir Prudent,'' Highland
Distilleries and Stewart Ivory are hoping he will help them to deliver
equally spectacular results.
Sir Hamish plans to settle in Edinburgh, where he has owned a house
for several years, but business commitments may taken him further afield
than the Highland Distilleries boardroom in Glasgow.
The Hong Kong Government has nominated Sir Hamish to become a member
of the World Trade Organisation appeals body, which is based in Geneva.
He is one of 32 candidates for seven appointments to the panel and is
still waiting to hear the outcome.

A HOST of Herald Angels will be awarded at the Festival Theatre. Our
critical team has identified five winners, who will receive their gilded
statuette from comedian and writer Simon Fanshawe.
Dans La Solitude Des Champs De Coton is a modern masterpiece -- in the
writing of Koltes, the direction of Chereau, and the perfectly pitched
performances by Chereau and Greggory. ''An extraordinary achievement,''
said our theatre critic Sara Villiers.
Scottish actor Kath Howden has produced some superb performances in
the Traverse and elsewhere in recent years. In the revival of Sue
Glover's Bongaders, a sell-out hit at the Traverse this August, she
gives a highly effective and affecting interpretation of the demanding
role of Tottie.
Since his illness and successful liver transplant, artist John Bellany
has been recognised as one of Scotland's top artists. The retrospective
exhibition at the Talbot Rice gallery at Edinburgh University shows why.
The testosterone frenzy that is Australia's Tap Dogs has already been
hymned in these pages. Suffice to say that Dein Perry and the perspiring
hunks that have reinvented the soft-shoe-shuffle have been the hit of
this year's Fringe with women of all ages as well as some men.
The final award goes to Festival director Brian McMaster, in
recognition of the music programme in this year's international
festival. As well as being thematically coherent, it is clear that
McMaster is building the audience, exactly as he has done for dance.
The sole Little Devil of this week goes to Jacqueline Haigh, an Oxford
University student who brought her one-woman show, The Pigeon, based on
Patrick Suskind's novella. An hour before the first performance she was
told by his Hamburg publishers that the show must not go on. Rather than
lose her Fringe slot, Haigh sat down and wrote and learned a new show,
Melodrama For Woman and Fridge, in a mere four days. And a polished and
professional work it turned out to be.

THERE was dancing in the streets when it was learned this week that
high-fliers were being bribed by sundry universities to cast their lot
with them to spice up the institutions' prospects of giddy success in
the exam league tables.
Those with an ear to the inside track report that five straight A
passes are worth, apparently, a thousand quid cash in a plain brown
envelope, a wild weekend for two in Fiji, or a year for 10, all costs
included, in Bo'ness. Flaming youth.
Ours being a consumer society this kind of high-revving success
apparently matters. Dreaming spires are from yesterday -- today it's
world class or look to your laurels. Slim exam success equals fewer
students, amounts to no cash, scores ultimate closure -- QED.
So good luck to those with the mental engine power to take advantage.
Let their bed-sits long ring to the pop of champagne corks, may their
scratch cards come up trumps. But what of the second-rate remainder,
those whose intellectual equipment leaves us, academically speaking, as
unattractive to any seat of higher learning as a carbuncle on the behind
of mankind: that great lumpen mass of us who have aimed low in life . .
. and missed?
Well, and remember you heard it here first, the new cash bribes can be
ours as well and, if we but play our cards right, even bigger than those
the bright boys and girls will get. Here's how.
Flourish your 11-plus certificate of scholastic incompetence to prove
you are a dunderheid, back it up with a scad of school reports heavy
with the red ink of ''could try harder'' and hit them with the threat of
matriculation, the university equivalent of a hostile take-over.
Threaten to sign on the line for four years of applied laser
technology and then tell them you cannot even change a light bulb:
torture their imagination by applying for a catering course even as you
pick casually at what appears to be terminal acne.
Any sharp academic who cherishes his four months of summer holiday,
who is not anxious to get out there in the world and mix it with the
60-hour week and the grim reaper of redundancy, will very quickly work
out on which side his bread is buttered.
Anxious to keep life jammy side up he will be open to suggestion, his
university's purse strings to loosening and, even before you have to
start drinking extraordinary quantities of beer elbow-to-elbow with real
students, the cash will be in your hand . . . paid off to go elsewhere,
a kind of remittance man from the halls of academe. Just remember not to
sell yourself cheap.
However, ever mindful of the fact that when one door opens another one
shuts, I must draw to your attention the latest totally unworkable
scheme to have come out of that overworked body, the Department of
Flotsam and Jetsam which, as most of us already know and Michael Forsyth
is beginning to suspect, is only a quick step down Whitehall from the
Minister of Silly Walks.
I refer to the plan, guaranteed to put blue-rinse hair on end in a
standing ovation of ecstasy, that recalcitrant youth be banged up in
military-style glasshouses, there to be forced to be good by methods for
which the army has long, and deservedly, been world famous.
Expect to see a lot of trainers on the street with bulled up toe-caps,
and denims with a knife-edge crease held in place with soap. As far as
the rest of us are concerned the only hope seems to be that a surfeit of
underdone red meat will knock the blue-rinse brigade off its birchwood
branch before an option is taken to re-open Botany Bay.
Mark you, the Government's weary new policy to ''get tough on crime''
may lead to not a little confusion in the minds of the younger
generation who have just been issued with a Tots' Charter for any stay
they may have in hospital -- before, that is, they go either to boot
camp or a university career.
Under this latest piece of consumerist balderdash everyone attending
youngsters as they lie between the sheets and have thermometers put in
places that no prudent person would normally store such a delicate
instrument, will have to come on like a hyperactive Butlin's redcoat in
overdrive. Smiles and smiles, kindness and sweetness sufficient to rot
the teeth of even the most sceptical.
Will kissing make it all better? Or will the Tots' Charter be like the
rail travellers' placebo which leaves a late train still late and a
missed appointment still missed, even as it allows the thwarted
traveller to believe that life on the slow track is not all bad?
Presumably if Dr Doolittle or Sister Cruella fail to measure up, the
little invalids will be able to take them, via the sluice room, to the
cleaners -- matching pound for pound what their big brothers and sisters
wring from the further education system either as students or drop outs,
or drain from the public purse the Eton-type fees which glasshouses will
be sure to cost.
A complete policy for the nation's youth, one might say: hot-housing
the delinquent, further gilding jeunesse doree and the prick of the
needle for those in no position to argue. It was not always thus.
Some decades back when the popular prejudice was for knees and feet to
point forward, I spent the equivalent of a stretch for armed robbery in
Christopher Robin ward having my legs brought in line. There was no
charter then but we did get three meals a day -- the same meals, every
day -- and as much rough treatment as was necessary to teach us to buff
our plaster casts to a mirror-like sheen.
We benefited immensely from this course of the real world and left
determined to survive by taking bribes if necessary, practising
blackmail if required, and bulling our boots when the occasion demanded.
Who says today's lot are brighter?

EFT, the Glasgow-based consumer asset finance group, reported record
growth in new business during the first half of this year, despite tight
market conditions which show no sign of letting up.
EFT provides leasing facilities for companies investing in new plant
and equipment and consumer finance for car purchases. It also
specialises in truck hire and the financing of new vehicles for bus
companies.
Pre-tax profits soared to #2m from #1.2m in the first six months of
1994, reflecting the contribution of Haydock, a Blackburn-based consumer
finance company, which EFT acquired in February.
Haydock contributed #2.3m to group turnover of #7.5m during the six
months to June 30.
But revenue from continuing activities rose by a healthy 23% to #5.2m
and EFT announced a 14% rise in the interim dividend to 0.6p.
Hamish Grossart, EFT chairman, said: ''All the businesses produced
record levels of new business.''
He said that because EFT was still a small player in the asset finance
market, good management had enabled it increase its share despite
difficult trading conditions.
''We have coped quite well with reasonably tough markets over the last
15 months and we think we can continue to do so,'' Mr Grossart said.
He predicted that margins would remain at their present low level
until the end of this year, but did not anticipate that they would
deteriorate further.
Commenting on EFT's performance so far in the second half of the year,
Mr Grossart said: ''We are able to report continuing evidence of
satisfactory trading.''
Analyst Richard Andrews at Edinburgh broker Bell Lawrie White said the
results were ''bang in line'' with expectations and his full-year profit
forecast of #4.6m, up from #3.4m last year was unchanged.
Nevertheless, EFT shares slipped 1p to 86p.

IT'S always nice to return from holiday and find things looking good
back at the office. Howard Flight of fund manager Guinness Flight, who
got back in time to look at the possibilities for the rest of this year
for his latest market review, comments: ''For most financial assets the
prospects look to be most favourable.''
For the majority of mature economies he feels growth has slowed
sufficiently to take the pressure off interest rates but not to the
extent of implying that we are going to have a recession.
Japan, having recognised the threat of deflationary depression, is
acting to drive down the yen exchange rate. Mr Flight, who has a good
track record in these matters, sees ''the prospect of a substantial
dollar bull market over the next two years''.
This, he cautions, may be subject to ''periods of volatility'', but
his view is that ''when the Japanese capital outflows gather momentum
there is scope for substantially greater yen depreciation than has
occurred in the last month. A target of 120 yen looks reasonable.''
At 120 yen to the dollar, Japanese exports ''would return to
significant profitability and this should accommodate a significant
recovery in the Japanese stock market, which would in turn greatly
relieve the pressures on Japanese banks in terms of both capital
adequacy and bad debts''.
He sees European currencies weakening against the dollar although by
less than the yen, with scope for the pound to drop to around $1.35.
As for stock markets, he views Japan as the star performer, with the
UK being one of the best in Europe and Germany the poorest.
Looking at emerging markets, Guinness Flight feels smaller companies
in Asia are currently cheap compared with the market leaders there. It
is, therefore, launching a new Asian Smaller Companies Fund with a 1%
discount offer until September 29. This will invest mainly in Hong Kong,
Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand. In October it plans to launch a new
fund to invest in India, where it believes a prospective price earnings
ratio of around 14 offers comparatively good value among the higher
growth economies.
Staying with emerging markets, Credit Lyonnais Laing sounds a note of
caution for anyone speculating on a break-up of the Five Arrows Chile
investment trust. It recalls that after the GT Chile Growth Fund,
responding to an attempt to gain control, said it was looking at ways to
reduce its discount, the discount on Five Arrows Chile narrowed from 35%
to 24%.
Seeing that move as partly due to speculation that Five Arrows may
also be a potential target, the broker took a hard look at its discount.
It comments that the calculation does not take account of the prospect
of net realised capital gains being subjected to a 10% withholding tax
at the time of being remitted outside Chile, and says this would reduce
the realisable discount to 17%.
On top of that, it says, attempting to dispose of a $360m portfolio
would be ''a timely and costly process''. So it suggests a conservative
estimate would be for a further reduction in the net asset value of 2%
or 3%.
Emerging markets are pretty volatile places where you may strike it
rich quick or find you have bought in just ahead of a setback. So it is
best to think long term.
For those whose nerves do not permit such ventures, it is comforting
to note that an air of confidence remains over large parts of the UK
market, although a recent look around by the strategy team at broker
Smith New Court notes that broker downgrades to estimates of earnings
per share have been exceeding upgrades. Nevertheless, it predicts next
year ''should see a decent rebound in consumer spending''.
The big upgrades are being given to companies which have competitive
products and are showing reasonable growth. Among these the broker lists
British Steel, British Aerospace, ICI, Siebe, TI and GKN. Water
companies and banks are also predicted to be able to be more generous.
Dividend forecasts have tended to rise with 57% of predictions for
higher payouts. The strategy team is dropping Redland, Rank and BAT from
its buy list and replacing them with Standard Chartered, Tate &amp; Lyle,
and Rolls-Royce.
It comments that at Redland and Rank the weakness of consumer spending
is undermining profit forecasts. Spending is expected to recover but the
companies are suffering meantime. They continue, however, to offer
better value than the big retailers where price earnings ratios are
higher. BAT, it says, still ''looks fine with persistent upgrades'' but
it is removing it from the list because the new stocks seem even more
attractive.
It likes Standard Chartered because there have been strong upgrades to
forecasts of both earnings and dividends, while Tate &amp; Lyle has a low
price earnings ratio but there have been steady upgrades in broker
forecasts. And earnings are recovering at Rolls-Royce.
On the bear list Unilever comes in replacing Cadbury. The comment is
that Unilever has a poorer trend in estimates and directors have been
selling. Vodafone, meanwhile, is dropped from the bear list.

<HEADLINE>Bold bid to stimulate housing market. Abbey takes bull by horns</HEADLINE>

BRITAIN'S second-largest mortgage lender, Abbey National, now
converted to a bank from a building society, has taken the bull by its
horns and cut its variable mortgage rate by 0.35% in an effort to
stimulate the housing market, still locked in recession.
Margins of mortgage providers are historically high, and banks and
building societies are struggling to find customers wanting mortgage
finance. Other leading players are considering their positions and a
price war looks inevitable. Only the Northern Rock has so far followed
the Abbey's lead.
Money has been flowing back into building society coffers in recent
months and lower rates for savers, still to be announced, are likely to
help pay for cheaper mortgages.
Competition in recent months has concentrated on attractive fixed-rate
mortgages, special offers for first-time buyers, and other discounted
rates, but these may not have the same impact as a cut in the headline
rate.
Abbey believes that bank base rates have peaked at 6.75%. While there
is no immediate prospect of rates rising, this may be a little
optimistic, especially if the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth
Clarke, succumbs to pressure for substantial tax cuts in his Budget, now
less than three months away.
Inter alia, Clarke is expected to produce a package of measures to
resuscitate the housing market. There is speculation that this could
include the abolition of the 1% stamp duty on house purchase, and more
generous tax relief on first-time buyers' mortgages.
There are fears that the time lag in bringing forward such measures is
delaying purchases. Figures from the Bank of England yesterday showed
lending for house purchase was chronically weak.
Net lending for house purchase plunged from #1300m in June to #932m in
July, a fall of 28% on the month. Compared with July of last year the
decline was a massive 47%.
There was further bad news from the Nationwide Building Society, whose
house price index was unchanged in August, but 0.9% lower than a year
ago.
The Nationwide, one of those reviewing its rates, calculates that UK
house prices are about 20% lower than in 1989, and blames the fragility
in the market on measures to reduce mortgage tax relief and income
support.
Falling house prices, largely an English phenomenon, have had a
deleterious impact on market confidence, damaging perceptions of housing
as an attractive investment.
Hopes of recovery rest with improved prospects for growth in personal
incomes, stimulated by tax cuts. Affordability is not an issue. Even so
the Abbey's initiative, born of desperation perhaps, could be the spark
to rekindle life in the housing market.
The Chancellor could help, too. The sooner details of any housing
package are announced the better. The housing market needs uncertainty
like a hole in the head.
In contrast to the weak figures for housing-related borrowing, which
were foreshadowed by the Building Societies and British Bankers
Association data, consumer credit surged ahead in July.
Net consumer credit grew by #701m, far beyond City forecasts, after
rising #593m in June. The July figure was the strongest since December
and provides further evidence that consumer spending is holding up
better than the retail sales figures suggest.
Bank lending jumped from #415m to #535m and credit card lending from
#82m to #147m. Retail sales rose by 0.4% in July, the same as in June.
Spending on leisure services seems to be outpacing spending on goods.
There was cheering news from the Purchasing Managers Survey, which
showed a welcome decline in manufacturers' cost pressures as the prices
paid index dropped from 70.6% in July to 62.2% in August and supply
bottlenecks eased further.
On the activity side the indicators were generally little changed with
the overall purchasing managers index (unchanged at 52.2%) still
pointing to expanding output, but at a lower pace than earlier in the
year.
The Chancellor meets the Governor of the Bank of England, Eddie
George, on Thursday after the summer recess. The meeting is no more than
a formaility with the only interest being in whether George decides to
drop his earlier calls for higher interest rates. That will not be known
until six weeks after the event.

THERE was a rite of passage in our family called the home perm. In our
late fifties social milieu, anyone over the age of 10 with a ponytail
was a retard. Tony Twinks were the first small, smelly, roll on the
rocky road to womanhood.
Two bottles of foul potion, a sheaf of white tissues and the
unforgiving puce pink and blue curlers transformed the initiate into a
bubble-cut novitiate, moving ever onward towards the ritual shedding of
the Liberty bodice for a brassiere.
Luck was with me when the time came for the lopping of the curls. A
good auntie, not quite a fairy godmother but a woman of means who
generously splashed out her earnings as a labeller in the VAT69 Bond
(and famed for getting the odd, illicit bottle past security in her
roll-on) to sweep me off to a swanky hairdresser.
It was, I think, another rite of passage, right up there with having
every tooth pulled to avert future toothsome troubles, if not collapsed
jaws. I missed out on that one, having a mother with modern ideas.
Whoever it was said you could never find a tumbler in our house unless
it was smiling at you must have been a frequent overnight guest at my
grandparent's home.
Clothes were simple then, literally: identical shift dresses of dull
floral prints in summer, run up from some sad Simplicity pattern, and
overdresses of needlecord in winter. There was the obligatory good coat,
always nipping a bit under the armpits, for Sunday school, and of course
The Party Frock. Frilled, frou-frou, frothy, the lacier the better, it
jagged at the bare legs and crackled alarmingly when prised over the
sticky-out nylon petticoat. It was, of course, invariably of a pale
powder-puff tone, chosen from a stale variety of C&amp;A pink.
That I began by dressing my own children in loud primary colours,
stripes, bold patterns, may, I concede straight away, be a reaction to
all those social constraints, with their iron laws of proscription: red
and green should never be seen, except on an Irish queen, ruled out
anything except mimsy tones. That my daughter's soft bob was my personal
antidote to nights spent trying to place an inch or so of head not
swaddled in rollers or rags on the pillow is undoubtedly true. But
choosing a child's clothes to value comfort and easy mobility over
scratchy, lace-trimmed exhibitionism, is surely not that misguided? So
where did I go wrong?
How is it that my daughter has a penchant, no a passion, for glitter
tights, Barbie T-shirts and lace trims with everything, even ankle
socks? I have been forced by a wardrobe full of cheap polyester printed
with bad reproductions of Polly Pocket, drawers full of frilly skirts,
tiers of nylon frothing malevolently from every shelf, to conclude that
I have spawned an incorrigible worshipper at the altar of Lena Zavaroni,
circa 1972. It's all my fault.
There is, I acknowledge, some deep stuff going on here. My mother did
me a favour. The origins of our early sixties' clothes were virtually
untraceable. These days when parents dress the child they are projecting
upon it the exact details of their own taste and socio-economic
circumstances. Spot OshKosh (wealthy, middle-class, two children to pass
down to), Next (wannabee Gap), Marks &amp; Spencer (short of time and
imagination, viz: most working mothers) and so on.
Where does this leave me? My daughter's taste for rhinestone-studded
fluffy boleros and iridescent hairbands puts me in the category of, say,
com-petition ballroom dancer. And I think wistfully of the days when she
was a malleable lump of dimpled puppy fat who could be whisked off to be
kitted out in achingly tasteful beige slub-weave cotton coveralls or
navy dungarees. Then, surely, people would be bound to say what
faultless good taste, what immaculate dress-sense.
In fact what they probably said was what a sad old-fashioned victim of
a parent it is that allows her own vanity to dictate the nature of a
child's wardrobe. And if I force it -- I fear -- she will inevitably end
up, aged 15, married to the concept of nylon ski-pants in lime acetate,
and f...-me-shoes. Better to let her express herself now, even if it is
in promotional Aladdin sweatshirts with integral squeak panel and fake
ruby tears. It was a consoling thought that, along with the sight of her
soft, well-cut bob. It was. Then, last night, she asked for ringlets.

Will McMillan describes the futility of government job schemes which
left him bereft of hope and feeling useless
HAVING been unemployed long-term and having experienced several
government ''employment'' schemes, such as the former Community
Programme, two different Job Clubs in different parts of the country
and, more recently, a Restart Programme in Edinburgh, I believe I know
enough about the past to realise that the value of the future is in the
anticipation of it.
The real tragedy of unemployment is that millions of people in this
country and throughout the European Union have had this sense of
anticipation taken away from them. The problem that their respective
governments now have is how best to restore an overall sense of
expectation to their lives.
From personal experience of different government schemes, I know how
difficult it can be to regain this sense of anticipation, which is an
essential prerequisite for anyone trying to find work which is useful
and permanent. Whether the different government schemes which are now
available in our social security system are useful and lead on to
permanent employment is a very open question.
I spent 10 months on the Community Programme, as it was then, working
with the Keep Scotland Tidy Group based in a small building near Craigie
College in Ayr. While it is true that the Community Programme did give
me work experience for a limited period, it was limited work and limited
experience. Which is not to say that I didn't enjoy certain aspects of
it; but looking back, it was work which had little to do with my
abilities and it has had no lasting benefit.
There is a real difference between useful work, ie, work that is
useful to the people who are doing it, and work that is only necessary.
Necessary work can be useful, but it can also be mundane and boring.
Anyone who has a job can tell you the difference between having a job
and being in work; between employment and work. I certainly can. It is
the difference between having to do something to earn a living and
wanting to do something which is actually beneficial not only to
yourself but to others as well.
It is a difference which the Government doesn't seem to recognise. It
is a difference which successive governments since the war haven't
recognised.
The Government's attitude, through the different training schemes
which now exist to get people back into employment, seems to be:
something will do and we will find you something to do. It really is an
open-door policy. The definition of the word ''something'' is so wide
that it includes almost anything, anything, that is, except giving
people work that makes them feel useful again.
I have had something the Government wanted me to do and it was not
useful. Not in the long run. Not in the fullest sense of the word.
Neither to me, nor the community. There is a world of difference between
doing something for the sake of it and doing something that is really
useful. Usefulness has a unique sense of fulfilment about it.
In my experience they are complete opposites. At the moment I am in
work -- I am a freelance writer -- but not in regular employment. I have
not been in regular employment for X number of years. I am not even in
regular work, but I live in hope. After all, who can live without it?
To a certain extent the Government's training schemes only reflect
people's attitude to work, rather than the immense changes that have
already taken place and that will take place in the near future with the
advent of information technology and industry becoming more and more
domestic.
There is a special kind of freedom which comes from contemplating your
aims and then trying to achieve them. It is this freedom which
unemployment takes away from you. It is this freedom that I want to
experience each day and know I am experiencing it. Perhaps this is
asking too much of any government, but work itself is changing; we need
a government which reflects these changes.
The problem of unemployment is the problem of work. Unfortunately the
Government is only dealing with the problem horizontally, not
vertically.
We were made to be useful and we as individuals are restless, whether
we have a job or not, without a genuine sense of usefulness in our
lives.
When John Wesley, the English evangelical preacher, said: ''I don't
want to live and be useless, Lord'' he was simply stating a spiritual
truth which millions of people throughout the European Union are being
denied today. His words are more contemporary than he could ever have
imagined. It is the kind of truth which can give us all a genuine sense
of freedom in our lives.
Necessity is to a certain extent inevitable, but only to a certain
extent. It is only the means of living, not the reason for living. As
Simone Weil once said: ''There is always something horrible whenever a
human being seeks what is good and only finds necessity.'' In that
respect finding a good job is much more difficult than you might think.
Finding a place on a good training scheme is even more difficult than
that.
But I am speaking from my own experience. Your experience will be
different. It may even be better. I hope it is.
Lack of experience is still the biggest obstacle to getting a job. No
job, no experience; no experience, no job. It is still the classic
Catch-22 situation. A place on a government training scheme doesn't
necessarily guarantee anything. In the past it has been rumoured that
the attitude of certain employers to these schemes is, to say the least,
ambiguous.
It seems to me that in the past many government schemes to get people
back to work have concentrated on necessary community work and there has
also been a distinct lack of any financial incentive for anyone who is
unemployed to participate in these schemes. I believe the same problem
exists in our social security system today.
A good example of this is the Community Action Programme which started
a few years ago. It provides an opportunity for people who have been
unemployed for more than a year to do part-time voluntary work in the
community for an allowance which is equivalent to their benefit, plus
#10 a week extra.
Whether #10 a week extra is enough of a financial incentive for anyone
to do this kind of community work when they are already receiving their
benefit and not working is the obvious question.
The Government's argument seems to be that work experience is better
than no work at all. There are those people who say that this type of
government scheme is more useful to the Government than it is to anyone
else.
A cynic might ask: ''What is the difference between the Community
Programme and Community Action? There is still the same incentive, or
lack of it. Well, at least they've changed the name slightly.'' A cynic
might say that, but I'm not a cynic. Not yet.
Being unemployed can be a life of aimlessness, of wandering in the
Land of Nod. There is no doubt about that. But so can a place on a
government training scheme. From my experience of the Community
Programme, when there was nothing for us to do, there were times when
all we ever seemed to do was drink coffee and talk, all day long. And
days like that were very long days, but thankfully there weren't too
many of them, at least not that I can remember.
The strange thing was that after I went home in the evening I was so
tired that I needed a few hours sleep to recover from this kind of
inactivity. I was quite literally worn out, but it wasn't a healthy kind
of tiredness. Not the kind you get after working hard doing something
worth while. It was more of an unhealthy lethargy.
Having your hopes raised only to have them dashed affects people in
different ways. A friend of mine who went on a Restart Programme was
asked by the person who was running it what he expected to get out of it
and he replied, ''parole''. My friend didn't have to finish his
sentence.
From my own experience of the Restart Programme I found that I was
being told things I already knew. Like how to behave in an interview
situation. At times I almost felt as if I was being insulted. I know how
to be polite, I don't need to be told. I certainly don't need the
Government to tell me.
As far as political action is concerned I believe it should not be a
case of political necessity demands that we, the Government, find some
sort of work which we think is useful for people who are unemployed, but
rather that all of us who can help to create the conditions whereby
people who are unemployed are given the opportunity ''to do useful work
which is linked to their abilities and expectations''.
My reason for saying this is that I believe we should always have a
higher motive for our political actions than mere necessity.
Unemployment is not simply an economic or social problem. It is a
spiritual problem. It creates isolation, which is itself a spiritual
problem, and it has also helped to create the fallacy that if we give
people what is necessary, ie, jobs, they will be satisfied. Necessity,
like entertainment, will never satisfy our social demands, let alone our
spiritual need.
The problem is how to give people that unique sense of usefulness in
their lives, or how to regain it for them. If we are going to deal with
the problem of unemployment let us at least be honest about it.
It is also worth remembering that many of our attitudes towards work
are religious, at least in their origins. In Scotland our attitude
towards work dates back to the Protestant reformer, John Knox, and the
Reformation. To quote the well-known industrialist, Sir Fred Catherwood:
''The Original Protestant Ethic is perhaps seen in its purest form in
the Scottish attitude towards work and education. The Scots seem to
apply themselves to work and self-development with more wholehearted
zeal than the English, and though it might be difficult to prove, they
seem to be more successful in business and the professions for their
numbers, than the English.''
From a theological point of view there is no conflict between grace
and work. One is a consequence of the other. Useful work gives us back a
sense of our own worth.
Let me put it like this; I am as special as everyone else, I am as
unique as everyone else, I am as exclusive as everyone else. I am most
certainly not the same as everyone else and I don't want to be treated
as if I am the same as everyone else.
It is worth remembering that people give you the value you give
yourself. Although having said that it is sometimes very difficult to
hold on to that truth if you are constantly comparing yourself to people
who have jobs and all you have is a place on a training scheme and an
uncertain future at the end of it.
The different government schemes which are now available in the social
security system are an attempt to deal with the different circumstances
in which people who are unemployed, or people who have special needs,
find themselves, but there is a very real problem with the sheer number
and complexity of the different schemes that now exist. Need is still
need, but even that has changed. The need is often quite genuine, but
the bureaucracy to meet that need, whatever the particular need may be,
is in itself an obstacle in the way of the very people who need help and
advice.
The need for social security is obvious, but so is the cost. However I
believe it is quite wrong to think of costs, whatever the cost of social
security is, or will be in the future, simply in terms of finance.
Without doubt it costs an astronomical amount of money, but when we
think of social security expenditure in the popular use of the term we
also have to think of the cost of the different training schemes that
are now available and ask ourselves: How much of the money spent is an
investment?
Scottish Enterprise, the organisation which is responsible for the
running of so many of the Government's training schemes in Scotland, had
an Adult Training Allowance budget for 1994/95 of #45.1m. The Adult
Training Allowance for 1995/96 is #39.5m.
In the present social security system there are almost 20 different
schemes which are concerned with unemployment alone. One of the most
successful and long-running of the Government's initiatives is the Job
Club. Since they were set up in 1984 it is estimated they have helped
more than one million people to get back into some sort of employment
and there are now 1400 Job Clubs throughout the country, 129 of them in
Scotland. In the past financial year 22,840 Scots passed through the Job
Clubs in Scotland.
To the Government, anyone who has been unemployed for a period of six
months or over is long-term unemployed. I have been unemployed for six
months and I have been unemployed for six years and although both times,
unknown to me, I was classified as long-term unemployed, there is a huge
difference. They have entirely different personal, social,
psychological, and spiritual consequences. To say that if you get
someone who has been unemployed for six months a job, you are dealing
with the problem of long-term unemployment is a mockery.
My own experience of two Job Clubs, one in Ayr and one in South St
Andrews Street in Edinburgh, was that, although the Job Clubs themselves
were very helpful with free stationery, stamps, access to telephones and
photocopiers etc, the general atmosphere was negative. It can be very
depressing to be surrounded by people who have a low self-esteem and to
be in that environment day after day.
It takes a strong person to resist that kind of pressure. It is in the
artificial environment of a Job Club that one discovers the importance
of such personal attributes as enthusiasm and the value of receiving
other people's encouragement. The leader of our Job Club in Edinburgh
was very enthusiastic and she was a great encouragement to me. People
who are unemployed are in a vulnerable position and, without wanting to
state the obvious, they need all the encouragement they can get.
Hope and usefulness are two of the most basic qualities of life and,
as I have tried to indicate from my own experiences of several
government employment schemes over a number of years, they are the
qualities which seem to me to be most conspicuous by their absence.
Short-term answers to long-term problems are no answers at all. To
give people short-term employment without the possibility of a long-term
future is to give with one hand and take away with the other. To quote
from an unusual source, but an entirely appropriate one: ''Hope deferred
makes the heart sick, but a longing fulfilled is a tree of life.''
Perhaps there is more to employment than what is necessary. I hope so.

BRITAIN'S June visible trade with the rest of the world confirms that
exports to the EU countries are still expanding but have fallen back
against the non-EU countries.
The overall picture is distorted by trade in oil and erratic items
though the underlying global trend appears to be flat. June's visible
trade deficit contracted to #868m from May's #1014m which has been
revised from #943m. This compared with market projections of around
#1100m.
The value of total exports was #12.7bn, an increase of 1[1/2]% on May
and almost entirely the result of increased exports to the EU which rose
from #7390m to #7530m. The gap with the EU has therefore narrowed from
#198m to #109m over the month, the lowest figure since August 1993. The
non-EU trade gap in June expanded from #716m to #759m and the recently
released July figure showed a further deterioration to #759m.
After excluding oil and erratic items, the visible trade gap narrowed
from May's #1532m (revised from #1383m) to #1441m as the value of
exports rose slightly and imports dipped. However, there was an increase
to #4323m in the second quarter from the first quarter's #3905m.
In the second quarter of 1995, total exports increased by 1[1/2]% with
a 3% rise in exports to the EU and a [1/2]% fall in exports to non-EU
countries. Imports increased by 4[1/2]% in the same period with a 3%
rise in imports from the EU and a 6[1/2]% rise from countries outside
the EU.
The volume of exports in June fell by 1% after stripping out oil and
erratic items while the volume of imports was [1/2]% down on May on the
same basis. In the second quarter the volume of exports was unchanged
with exports to the EU up [1/2]% while non-EU exports dropped by the
same amount.
The Treasury described the global figures as being on an ''even keel''
while the Central Statistical Office said they were ''flat''. Although
the deficit has increased between the first and second quarter -- from
#2000m to #3200m -- this largely reflected the trade in oil and erratic
items, said the Treasury.
Goldman Sachs' economist David Walton analyses that the underlying
trend in the visible trade balance has been reasonably stable in recent
months. Both export and import volumes have slowed in line with the
slowdown in overseas and domestic economic activity, although the
figures are of course notoriously prone to revision.
However, net trade is no longer making a contribution to quarterly GDP
growth and this, he says, is the main factor responsible for the
deceleration in GDP growth in recent quarters.
Adam Cole at James Capel said that while on the face of it the June
global trading data was considerably better than expected, once again
the surprise reflects no more than movements in trade in the erratic
items and the underlying figures continuing to point to flat to slowly
deteriorating trend in the deficit excluding oil and erratics.
From here on, exports and imports should grow strongly as activity in
our key export markets recovers and a further improvement in
competitiveness feeds through. Import growth on the back of the recovery
in domestic investment means the net effect will be a modest further
deterioration in the trade deficit.

* IAN DONACHIE, 48, a Red Cross volunteer and self-confessed
''pen-pusher'', works from 9am to 5pm for Strathclyde Regional Council.
He has been active in the Red Cross for eight years. Recent Red Cross
duties have included the Rod Stewart concert, Pipe Band Championships
and BMX display in Kelvingrove Park.
I HAVE seen someone die in front of me, knowing that I just didn't
have a clue what to do. I used to work on a construction site, as a site
engineer, and you see the occasional accident. Things can topple from
high places, people can fall down holes. There was a doctor round the
corner, he was called, but there was nothing anyone could do anyway. But
having experienced that feeling of helplessness, that motivated me to
doing a first aid course.
I always thought that first aid was a good idea. What got me started
was an ad in the Radio Times. It was a picture of a car crash and a
person running toward the situation to help. The caption was: The driver
survived the accident. But will he survive the first aid? I joined a Red
Cross course that September, then people started waving an application
form at me. Only 10 hours a year, minimum, they said. If it's any
indication I think to date I've done 250 hours during the course of the
year. Last year it was 400-plus. You do as much or as little as you
need.
I've always been willing to help. Joining the Red Cross doesn't make
you feel any different. I'm not more caring I'm more practised at caring
for people. The drunk lying on the street, you ask, ''Are you all
right?'' rather than walking by. Maybe making sure his air passage is
clear.
We at the Red Cross are like an insurance policy, we ward off
accidents. I still do first aid, but I'm involved in the welfare
services. We offer friendship, care, consideration and mutual respect.
It gives you satisfaction helping someone to do something they couldn't
do on their own.
For example, we'd just finished a first aid duty at Queens Park. The
ambulance was packed up, the engine was started, we were ready to go, a
mother came toddling over the hill with her baby. He'd fallen over and
hit his face in mud. His eyes were completely full of gunge, and he was
howling. All we did was wash out his eyes, it took quite a while because
it was all the way in. The mother was grateful because she didn't know
what to do. Such a simple thing as that, eased the pain and distress.
The Red Cross has a history, a special image, that's where we have a
greater respect than other first aid societies. The Red Cross was
founded by one individual wanting to care for others, that basic
philosophy is still there.
That's why I feel we're special. For example, during the flooding of
Paisley, people were reluctant to talk to social workers but they would
talk to us, you're not Government officialdom or part of the
bureaucracy.
The Red Cross is tending to be more business orientated. One thing
that is currently being considered, is getting contracts from the health
board, before, it was a service provided for the public. We need
business at a more contractual level. We'll have to employ lawyers.
Contracts have their good points and bad points, but it puts things on a
more legal basis. The society has to adapt. The skills of the Red Cross
will have to change.

* A SIMILARILY optimistic trading statement came from electronics and
defence giant GEC.
Chairman Lord Prior told the annual meeting of an expanding order
book. ''Sales and operating profits are ahead of last year,'' he told
shareholders. ''Also firmer interest rates resulted in higher interest
income.
''The key businesses, electronic systems, power systems and telecoms
have continued to win new orders at a satisfactory rate,'' he said.
Lord Prior said the order book, which stood at #12.8bn at the end of
July, had risen since the end of the financial year on March 31.
Earlier this summer GEC won a long and bitter takeover battle for
submarine maker VSEL. It paid #835m for VSEL, based at Barrow-in-Furness
in Cumbria, beating off a rival offer from British Aerospace.

CIDER sales have boomed during the long, hot summer, Taunton Cider
said yesterday.
''The cider market continues to grow strongly, with volumes up by 11%
in the year to June,'' chairman Michael Garner told shareholders at the
annual meeting.
''Since then, we have enjoyed a long period of warm and sunny weather
which has boosted sales still further.
''Our own sales volumes for the year so far are ahead of plan and
substantially above the equivalent period last year.''
He said the full benefit of cost savings would be achieved during the

SOME years ago my home acted as a mailbox for a young Canadian man who
had come to Scotland to join the Army. Ron was on the skids within a few
months, moving through a succession of jobs and digs, his fatal
attraction to alcohol and violence impelling him ever lower on the
social ladder. One escapade of which he boasted was to have dispatched a
customer, who was giving him a bad time in the crummy bar in which he
worked, by breaking a beer bottle of his head.
His father, a retired businessman who had adopted Ron as a baby, was
now a widower. His wife had been able to keep the boy from
self-destructing but now that her influence had disappeared Ron was on
the slippery slope. His almost unhealthy attraction to things military
was his father's last hope. Perhaps, he thought, like many before him,
the Army will sort him out.
Well, it didn't. Ron didn't make Her Majesty's Forces. They
(fortunately) spotted that a man who is a danger to himself is more of a
danger to the public when you put a gun in his hand. The last I heard of
Ron was 20 years ago, when he said he was going to try his hand with the
French Foreign Legion and if that failed he could always get a career as
a mercenary in Africa. He never returned for the papers which I held in
safekeeping. By this time he was living rough with a strong addiction to
alcohol and none to personal hygiene.
Oh yes, I did try to help him from reaching skid row. The spare room
usually had to be fumigated after his occasional stays and on one tragic
occasion he had Christmas dinner at my home. He brought a bottle of
Canadian Club but it was the rich food which made him vomit, not the
whisky. His diet of junk food had not prepared his stomach for turkey
and trimmings. Poor Ron, he did not easily evoke sympathy in those who
met him and his violent tendency made us very wary of getting involved.
I still think about Ron, but they are not all feelings of regret. He
gave me my first insight into the dark of those who embark on a long
downward slide. At the time (the early seventies) my upbringing and my
work was far removed from the world of down and outs. I said prayers for
them as a Kirk minister, I made programmes about them as a radio
producer, but I never got near enough to smell them -- and to know them.
It has made me wary of making judgments about ''down and outs'' and it
has made me realise that facile theories about housing provision or the
evils of drink will not explain the powerful impulsion towards
self-destruction which drives them.
Tragically, many of them damage others as they destroy themselves, but
the majority of men (and increasingly women) who become vagrants are
more danger to themselves than anyone else. The biography of those who
inhabit the hostels run by charitable organisations has a terribly
familiar ring to it. Single man, lives with mother, has no social life
but the pub; mother dies and he has no idea about cooking and paying
bills, so feeds on beer and forgets the rest; loses job, acquires debts
and is made homeless, then finds forgetfulness in drink.
Those who work in the Talbot Association, the City Mission, or the
Lodging House Mission know the pattern only too well. They are the front
line (or should one say the bottom line?) of care. After the friends and
the family and then the statutory agencies have done their best, these
unsung heroes of our cities try to restore dignity and a degree of
comfort to the ''down and outs''. The work is not easy. A person whose
mind and body has been ravaged for years by poverty, alcohol, or drug
abuse, is not easily polished up so that the image of God comes shining
through. The downward spiral has sometimes twisted once too far.
The last thing such agencies need is hostility from communities in
which new improved hostels are being proposed, such as is happening over
the Kingston Hall project run by the Talbot Association. Such agencies
need compassion, not criticism. Compassion is surely not too much to ask
from those of us who are not affected directly by the suffering of down
and outs. Alas, that is not what happens in many cases.
Like that of the former bank manager, now a vagrant, who appeared in
court this week in Dingwall for having frightened two girls who had
woken him from a drunken sleep in a park. Even the fiscal acknowledged
that he had no history of interfering with children and that it was a
case of a chronic alcoholic having been wakened from sleep. Why then was
the case brought, if not a finger had been laid on the girls?
The vagrant, who had begun his decline after the death of his wife,
has a bank pension paid via his brother which would have easily covered
the #100 fine, but because the sheriff gave no time to pay and the
brother is on holiday, he was taken to the cells. How's that for
compassion?
I feel anger and anguish when I read of such cases. Most people would
feel similar emotions when they read of the tragic case of the
undiscovered body lying in the boarded-up flat in Shettleston. But
before people rush (as they will) to blame this or that agency and
demand guidelines for joiners who board up houses, would it not be
better to conclude that a mickle of common sense and a muckle of
compassion is a much better way to handle care in the community. Of
course if you have a community without common sense or compassion, what
chance have those who have lost their soul? There is always the tender
mercy of sheriffs and social workers. God help them -- and the rest of
us.

The joy of being the wrong sex is that you meet the play as a new play
LOVE it or hate it, Richard II in the National's Cottesloe has become
one of this year's most controversial theatrical events. There were
Hildegard Bechtler's dramatically stunning designs, and Deborah Warner's
universally praised production, but reaction to the high-wire, febrile
Fiona Shaw taking on the male role, has been equivocal to say the least.
''Not male enough to play Peter Pan,'' sniffed the Independent, neatly
managing to miss the point. Shaw's Richard is not an actress in kingly
robes playing at being male, but rather a portrait of flawed kingship
portrayed with an androgyny that renders gender irrelevant.
So why would a woman want to play a king?
If you're an actress at the top of your bent, changing gender is just
about the most challenging thing you can do. Some will say you're
jumping into gender-bending as an opportunist career move; others will
cast aspersions on your credentials to play a man; others will say, as
indeed did the Observer that for Fiona Shaw to take on Richard II was
indication of a career in crisis.
None of this seems to tally whatsoever with the woman sitting across
the way from me in the National Theatre's press office. She seems
neither like a woman under the professional kosh, nor about to launch
into a political manifesto. Though, if that was what she was about, that
would be all right too.
Fiona Shaw's impulses as an actress are neither transparent nor
linear. Taking on the lyrical monarch is neither the last gasp of a
theatrical desperado -- though there is something undoubtedly
buccaneering about her -- nor the stirrings of a siren in travesty.
Shaw unarguably is in the front rank of classical actors, a three
times winner of the Olivier award. Physically exhausted she may be --
and who wouldn't be travelling a four-hour road from Divine Monarch to
outcast and murderer at least four times a week -- but she also seems
emotionally buoyant with thoughts and ideas tumbling from her with her
usual quicksilver lightness and unquenchable fire.
''I'm actually very pleased, just delighted with the way things are
going'', she says in a Cork accent unmarked by years of exile in London
and excursions to Hollywood. If the negative reviews have left their
mark on her, it's hard to discern -- though she does express anxiety
about the general level of British theatre criticism. ''I do think
criticism in this country is in a state of crisis because the language
is missing to describe what is happening. There's something parochial
about it.''
Shaw, now in her mid-thirties, and with a string of mould-breaking
theatrical summits already behind her: Electra; Hedda Gabler; the
heroine of Sophie Treadwell's Machinal, and a slew of light Hollywood
comedies -- is intense and passionate, but there is also, in among the
intellectual seriousness, an iridescent sense of mischief.
The sound of contradictions clashing up against one another, it
emerges, is clearly one of her joys: ''Contradiction is at the heart of
this play, everything is in opposition.'' An Irish woman playing an
English king for one: ''The audience daren't laugh when I say 'I'll to
Ireland and the wars'.''
On a more prosaic level, the reason for her doing Richard II, she
says, was nothing to do with jumping into drag. ''I'm not trying to make
any thematic or polemic statement about women doing men's roles,'' but
because making theatre for Shaw is all about pushing things to their
limit, and making fun of a large part of it.
Playing Richard is not, for Shaw, an act of sexual politics but more
to do with aesthetic and theatrical choice. ''It was an idea that had
been floating in the air for about three years, suggested by others and
the more it was floated, the more positive the response became. I fended
it off for a while because I was determined to do a comedy.
''I felt I'd done too much tragedy. But this year I was released by
knowing I'd be doing The Way of the World (a comedy in which she will
play Millamant) later in the year and that, fortuitously, Deborah
(Warner, her working partner and director), and the National and myself
were all free at the same time.
''I'd also read this marvellous book Vested Interests by an American
academic, Marjorie Garber, about the nature of cross-dressing and its
function in society. I had done a lot of Shakespeare's heroines but any
work I do with Deborah is always experimental. This was the first
Shakespeare I'd done with her so it was bound to be experimental.
''Choosing to believe someone is Richard plays into the heart of
theatre which is that you see things in opposite. It's more fun to play
'I'll pretend to be Richard if you'll pretend I am him and see what
happens'. That's always been my joy of theatre''.
Similarly, by playing being a man though a woman, Shaw maintains, her
very femaleness helps to liberate new things, different things in the
play. ''Maybe sometimes by withdrawing certain colours you see a
painting more clearly. It's not to say I'm saying more about Richard II
than anybody else would, but any man who takes on Richard II takes on
theatrical history and I don't. The joy of being the wrong sex is that
you meet the play as a new play.
''Femininity or femaleness sits at the heart of the play. Half the
energy by men playing it goes into being feminine. I don't have to put
any energy into it. None. The energy goes into something else.''
So why choose to play Richard II? Shaw thinks and responds: ''I think
what's interesting about breaking boundaries, whether I was a man or a
woman, is that Richard is the journey of a life -- from somebody quite
unattractive, to someone whom I've grown to like enormously. His saving
grace is the size of him. That, even when he appears to be behaving
small, he's actually also a very big person. I find that very
liberating.''
* Richard II continues in repertory at the National Theatre until the
end of November, and may be extended. Fiona Shaw will also star in
Congreve's comic masterpiece, The Way of the World, at the National from
October 19.

THE Red Cross recently lost its fundraising tearoom at the Southern
General Hospital to global burger giants McDonald's. The society founded
to care for the vulnerable, was effectively screwed by competitive
tendering. What the British Red Cross may not choose to celebrate on its
125th anniversary is the fall from being a strong and respected
institution, to an organisation struggling for a place in the modern
world.
The concerned majority have expressed fear about how money spent on
the National Lottery is affecting the level of charity donations. But
while arguments rage about petty cash, the economy quietly simpers on,
allowing the economic bulldozers to move in. It would be fairer to say,
that charities suffer financially because they are not ruthlessly
capitalist.
But the Red Cross is learning. Its members understand that some kind
of compromise has to be reached. Services must accommodate the
Zeitgeist, from dressing war wounds to providing short-term care for the
elderly, to offering aromatherapy massage to hospital patients. But if
the Red Cross is to exist, if it is to justify its place, then it must
learn to compete. This should be no problem, for its skills and training
are of the highest standard.
Disasters of the eighties and nineties, which the Red Cross has
alleviated, both practically and in terms of morale, include Piper
Alpha, Lockerbie, the Armenian earthquake, Zeebrugge, the Gulf War,
Rwanda, Somalia, and former Yugoslavia.
When there is an epidemic, uprising or war, revolution, conflict,
disease, drought or famine, the lives of Red Cross volunteers are on
call. In 1994 it was estimated that the present 100,000 Red Cross
members in Britain donated 5,000,000 hours, #24m worth of work. The last
country to form a Red Cross organisation was Cape Verde, which joined
the community 10 years earlier on November 3, 1984.
In its infancy, as even now, the Red Cross demonstrated the classic
dilemma of being able to help others, but not being able to help itself.
It was young Swiss businessman Henry Dunant who first came up with the
idea of humanitarian aid.
He witnessed the suffering of the wounded and dying on both sides,
during the Battle of Solferino, in 1859, fought in Italy between Austria
and the alliance of France and Sardinia. He wrote a book two years
later, where he suggested forming ''relief societies . . . for training
volunteers to care for the wounded in wartime . . . based on some
international principle''. The idea snowballed.
A conference was held in Geneva in 1863 attended by delegations from
16 countries. On August 22, 1864, delegates from 12 states signed the
Convention of Geneva ''for the amelioration of the condition of the
wounded in armies in the field''. For Dunant himself, however, the
triumph was short-lived. His business ventures failed and in 1867 he was
declared bankrupt. As a destitute old man he received the Nobel Peace
Prize in 1901 and died nine years later. In all that time, and in all
that poverty, he never touched his Nobel prize money of 10,400 francs.
What separates the Red Cross from other charitable organisations is
its history. War veterans, ex-POWs and civilians fondly remember Red
Cross parcels. The logo of the Red Cross itself represents a source of
help, all over the world.
But unlike other charities, members of the Red Cross, apart from
committing themselves to a minimum of 10 hours service a year, must
embrace the fundamental principles of the movement. These are: Humanity,
Independence, Voluntary Service, Impartiality, Neutrality, Unity, and
Universality.
While others divide, terrorise and kill over colour, politics or
religion, while soldiers, citizens and victims learn to hate, a Red
Cross volunteer must practise compassion, not condemnation. This is a
hard job. To volunteer to care is one thing, to retrain one's mind to
that of an unopinionated neutral is another.
To be non-judgmental is Christian, because the more you understand,
the harder it is to forgive.
The Red Cross believes that all are deserving of compassion. The idea
of providing indiscriminate aid for men and women and children in need
was born of a man's conscience. Like all charities, the Red Cross is now
the conscience of the nation, and, as volunteers know, the human
conscience at its best is an objective, unbiased instrument.

THE scene -- the playground of an Ayrshire primary school several
decades ago. Two 10-year-old girls, not the best of friends, are
talking. One is begging the other to teach her a song. It's not from
Oklahoma!, though that is all the rage among the playground cognoscenti.
No, it's from an obscure English ''choral drama'' called The Immortal
Hour by one Rutland Boughton.
The Faery Song (those were innocent days) belongs, like Barrie's Mary
Rose, to that genre of things capable of making hairs stand on end. The
eerie little paean to the supernatural could be heard in context on
Radio 3 on Thursday afternoon, when there was a rare airing of the whole
of Boughton's opera as part of Radio 3's splendid and ongoing festival
of British music, Fairest Isle.
Not only was The Immortal Hour fascinating musically but for its
background -- the effort early this century to establish a British
Bayreuth at Glastonbury. The opera evidently cast its escapist spell
over war-wearied Britain in the 1920s -- though the doomed hero's final
cry of ''My dreams, give me my dreams!'' returns it to a darker world.
Sir Harry Lauder, it could be argued, set back the cause of Scotland
as a serious nation by a century. Imprinted on generations of Americans,
Aussies, and South Britons was the image of the Caledonian as a manikin
with a skirt and a hideous tendency to go roamin in the gloamin on braw
bricht moonlicht nichts. One was not altogether in a mood for conversion
by Jimmy Logan's programme about the singing comic Roamin in the Gloamin
(made by Radio Scotland but broadcast on Radio 2 on Tuesday).
Predictably, it was a celebration rather than a critical assessment.
The facts of how the former miner soared from the pits to international
celebrity -- touring America in his own train, gaining music-hall's
first knighthood, and generating public lamentations on his death --
were clear enough. But the reasons for his charisma remained less so.
Certainly, the loss of his only son in the First World War, and his
heroic efforts to entertain the troops afterwards, must have given him
common ground with a host of grieving parents.
Old records can't do his voice justice, but it does come over as
tuneful. And, lest intellectual snobbery get out of hand, it must be
admitted that no other entertainer has so imprinted his compositions on
the popular consciousness. The Beatles perhaps? But they didn't make
people laugh.
The old boy tended to cackle at the climax of his songs. So last
chuckle to him.
The Skye Bridge, though now a reality, remains a matter of contention,
as this week's headlines and Iain MacDonald's programme about it on
Radio 5 both showed. Advocates and detractors were given pretty equal
billing on Bridge the Gap. On the whole, opposition was on the grounds
of the tolls rather than the bridge's lack of aesthetic appeal. But it
does look brutal in its Hebridean context of mountain and water.
There is also the imponderable effect of making a place of almost
mystic apartness too accessible. One man, viewing Gavin Maxwell's islet
where the bridge touches down, said sadly: ''I find the hand of man
oppressive here now.''
It's good to see the BBC making a gesture, other than a rude pop one,
towards the young. Children's BBC Radio 4 is running daily these days at
10.15am on long wave. It offers a serialised book. Maybe it's just
coincidence but last week's and this week's have both had an African
connection. The Exiles at Home was about four sisters whose lives
assumed all sorts of complications when they secretly sponsored a Kenyan
boy. Comfort Herself tells how a half-Ghanaian girl returns from Britain
to her father in Africa and tries to adjust to family life there. A
whiff of political correctness, perhaps, but they've been gripping
enough tales to hold adult attention too.

JACK WEBSTER meets a high-altitude champion for the cause of cystic
fibrosis sufferers
THE large and likeable Ed Stewart made radio history by broadcasting
his regular afternoon programme while climbing to the peak of Ben Nevis.
Ed made it, with a few breaths to spare, and in doing so gave a large
boost to public awareness of cystic fibrosis, the most common
life-threatening inherited disease in Britain today.
He also tickled the fancy of Fort William by preceding his
mountaineering feat with a march through town in his Stewart tartan
kilt.
The Radio 2 presenter had taken up a challenge from the Cystic
Fibrosis Trust to climb the 3560ft Snowdon and finish off his week by
climbing Britain's highest mountain.
''I'm no keep-fit fanatic or anything like that,'' Ed said, ''but in
middle-age I think you must keep yourself mobile. So from January 1 have
not used a lift or an escalator. I just walk.''
Though he had never climbed a mountain before, Ed was in good enough
trim to reach the top of Snowdon, encouraged by the fact that he was
being followed, step-by-step, by 17-year-old Robert Law from Chester, a
victim of cystic fibrosis.
Robert's twin sister Kate, who was also a victim, died last year. But
their parents, John and Carol Law, who were found to be carriers of the
disease, accompanied Ed Stewart on the week's adventure.
Driving north from Wales, they called at a clinic in Manchester and
talked to doctors about the search for a cure. So far, there is no
breakthrough, but a combination of vigorous exercise, drugs, and
attention to diet is leading to progress. It is essential to prevent a
build-up of mucus in the lungs.
So, whereas a baby of 40 years ago was likely to live for only a few
months, 75% now survive to adolescence and increasing numbers are
reaching well into adulthood, thanks to earlier diagnosis and improved
treatments.
On the genetic side, when both parents are carriers of the defective
gene, any child they produce will have a one-in-four chance of being
born with cystic fibrosis.
Ed's piece of live broadcasting history from the heights of Nevis
became a possibility only recently, through the latest in satellite
technology.
As Ed was reaching for Britain's highest peak, complete with big boots
and headphones, his signals were being transferred to an accompanying
engineer, who transferred them in turn to another engineer with a
powerful transmitter on his back.
He then sent the signal to a van at the bottom of Ben Nevis, which
shot it to the satellite known as Inmarsat, 22,000 miles out in space.
From there it was bounced back to a station in Cornwall and onwards to
Broadcasting House in Langham Place, London. That entire process,
incidentally, was completed in a single second!
Reaching Ben Nevis, Scotland's proudest peak, was a far cry from
another famous peak -- on the heights of Hong Kong, where Ed Stewart's
broadcasting career began 34 years ago.
Actually he first broadcast as a boy singer for the BBC World Service
in 1952, but it was nine years later when it became his full-time
occupation. Ed was a bass player in a band whose other members were
serving in the army in Hong Kong. He went out to join them, just as they
were all posted to Aden!
''I had to do something so I asked Radio Hong Kong for a job,'' he
recalls. ''They needed a film critic and a rugby correspondent -- and I
ended up as both. I was still only 19 and remember spending my 21st
birthday in the Wanchai bar of Richard Mason's Suzie Wong!''
After four years in the Far East, he returned to Britain where his
father, the assistant solicitor to the Treasury, expected him to find a
proper job. Instead, he became a disc jockey with the Radio London
pirate station, along with people like Tony Blackburn and Kenny Everett.
When that was outlawed, the BBC paid more attention to popular music
and Ed Stewart has been around Radio 1 and Radio 2 for most of the past
30 years. He was the first presenter of Junior Choice.
It was during a visit to Guy's Hospital, London, in 1970 that he asked
the children if anyone had a message they would like to call out to
someone at home.
The tape-recorder was running when an eight-year-old boy suddenly
called out to his little girlfriend, in a distinctive voice: ''Ello
Darlin'!'' That was 25 years ago -- and listeners still ask Ed to play
the fruity voice, which never fails to amuse. It has become a national
catch-phrase.
The curious part of that story is that Ed Stewart, who couldn't have
guessed the significance of the little incident, didn't take note of the
boy's name. And to this day, when he must now be 33, the real identity
of the lad has never been discovered. Others have tried to claim the
credit but didn't stand the test. Did the family emigrate? Or is he
still out there somewhere?
Ed Stewart himself lives with his charming wife Chiara near Woking and
they have a daughter Francesca, 20, and a son, Marco, 18.

I APPLAUD Brian Wilson asking us to rethink our attitudes to the vexed
question of pre-natal screening for handicap (August 27). He does so in
a thought-provoking yet sensitive manner.
However, I fear the future. The fate of many future generations of
unborn children, ''normal'' and handicapped, hangs in the balance.
No parent wishes to have a handicapped child. There are sacrifices
involved in bringing up any child and there are much greater sacrifices
asked of parents whose child is handicapped before or after birth.
However, if we are permitted to live long enough, we are all going to
become handicapped in some form, whether it be physical or mental. We
are going to require love and care and sacrifice from others. Sacrifice
is the price of love.
With the resources and the will, surely we can offer the unborn child
a more loving alternative than death before birth.

I REALISE that after only 20 years of discussion about a Scottish
parliament we are still very much at the conceptual stage and not yet at
the working detail stage but in the event of a tax-raising Scottish
parliament coming into being, I wonder if any thought has been given to
who would actually pay the Scottish tax and what mechanism could be used
to administer and collect it fairly.
Existing tax mechanisms are source-of-income based and not
place-of-residency based. Indeed, a recent Herald editorial suggested
that Scottish MPs would escape a Scottish tax because they are paid in
Westminster.
Scotland being largely a branch economy, thousands of others are in
similar situations of being domiciled in Scotland while on the payrolls
of organisations in England and elsewhere (and, cynical thought,
thousands more could arrange to be so) to say nothing of the many people
whose taxable pensions, superannuation payments, and so on are paid
outside Scotland with tax deducted at source.
Obviously we could not have a situation in which everyone domiciled in
Scotland enjoyed the benefits of a tax-raising Scottish parliament while
only those whose incomes could be identified as arising entirely within
Scotland actually paid the tax.
How would this problem be overcome? By establishing Scottish
residential qualifications after which employers and other payers of
income would be required to operate different tax tables for employees
and other payees officially classified as being Scottish residents?
A possibility certainly, but a Scottish residency-based tax might
smack a bit too much of a Scottish poll tax, even if this time related
to income, and non-Scottish employers and others, and even, perhaps,
non-Scottish Inland Revenue officers might quibble about being expected
to act as unpaid tax collectors for a Scottish parliament which they
might feel had little relevance to themselves.
It is probably pointless to worry about such details, however. No
doubt Mr Blair and Mr Robertson have already worked out how an
exclusively Scottish tax can be tacked on to a nationally based
mechanism with the tax falling fairly on everyone in Scotland.
It would be nice if they would let us know, though -- and preferably
before the next General Election.

MAY I congratulate Sam Galbraith on his excellent article about care
in the community (August 25)? He raised the crucial issue of people
requiring expert care being caught up in ''the great new credo'' and
being launched into the community regardless of their true requirements.
Mr Galbraith raises the further vital concept that some people require
''the environment moulded to them'' as their condition does not lend
itself to assimilation within the community.
I can speak with some experience of this current trend as we have a
27-year-old son at present in Lennox Castle Hospital.
Over the years he has been cared for in several types of
establishments all over Scotland, in many cases NHS and at times other
forms of provision. It has always been the case when events proved
difficult that only the NHS could or would come to our aid.
It would seem Lennox Castle is being targeted for closure yet our son
is very settled there and is expertly cared for, especially in the
control of his severe epilepsy.
Like Mr Galbraith I feel it is time to sit back, reflect, and take
stock of the real situation, not the vision of the textbook theory being
applied to all, regardless of individual needs.
I would always support people reaching their full potential in life as
part of the community but likewise let us not forget those who would
benefit from their environment and community being created for them.
Rather than closure, an investment should be made in places like
Lennox Castle to provide people with privacy and dignity while
continuing to provide them with expert supervision. In the case of
Lennox Castle the grounds and facilities are very conducive to the
creation of a secure yet open village atmosphere, allowing people with
other needs to reach their true potential.

I MUST write in defence of ''the humble aspirin'' which once again
came under fire by Dr Elizabeth Scott (August 24). Publishing horror
stories about excess use of a prescribed or over-the-counter pain remedy
can scare off the very people for whom the benefits far outweigh the
side effects.
While I agree aspirin in excess can be a source of gastric upset and
inflammation, surely the alternative popular remedy, paracetamol, is the
more lethal of the two.

YOUR front-page report on water charges is typical of modern
investigative journalism, accurate in what it says but totally
inaccurate by virtue of what it does not say (August 25). Let me put the
record straight.
Water charges relate to water and sewerage expenditure and the latter
is the more expensive part. Sewage disposal is one of the great
environmental problems and public pressure and EU regulation has meant
that lack of maintenance and complacency by local authorities over the
past half century are now being exposed.
One hears a lot about ''our water''. What about ''our sewage''?
The report claims that ''water'' bills are set to soar, next year up
15%. ''Water'' bills increased on average in Scotland between 1991 and
1994 by 66% which is a yearly increase of 16.25%. Mr Dick Douglas wanted
an explanation for the increase; perhaps he would like an explanation
for the reduction.
It is also interesting that Mr Gordon Brown is claiming (August 25)
that ''water'' charges in England have increased by 77% since
privatisation, an average annual rate of 11%.
Privatisation of the Scottish water and sewerage supply has not taken
place. Creating three large authorities has saved smaller unitary
authorities from possible exceptionally large costs due to problems of
area or relatively low population density.
Significantly, the ''unelected'' senior members who have been chosen
to run these quangos are also the ''unelected'' officials who ran the
large local water and sewerage organisations before.
Councillor Gould claimed that the ''increase'' in charges was due to
the cost of setting up the new water authorities. The cost of setting
them up will be #14m over two years; #11m of this will be borne by the
Government.
Expenditure on water and sewerage in Scotland in 1993-94 was #470m so
that even if the whole cost was set against ''water'' charges this would
only equate to a 1.5% increase. Surely he must have been mistaken!

THE article, Castle walls come crumbling down (August 28), contains
inaccuracies about the stonework restoration at Culzean Castle. The cost
of the project will be #5m and not #10m and it has been under way since
1991.
Half of the #5m was raised by public appeal and half is being provided
by grant-giving bodies including Historic Scotland, the European
Regional Development Fund, and the National Heritage Memorial Fund.
Restoration of the stonework at Culzean Castle itself has been taking
place for many years. The current project involves continued restoration
of the castle but also the restoration of some 50 other structures in
Culzean Country Park, some of which, like the castle, were designed by
Robert Adam over 200 years ago and are of international importance.
These structures include Adam's unique viaduct, the restoration of
which is almost complete, as well as many other buildings large and
small.
The National Trust for Scotland employs a stonemason with four
apprentices at Culzean who, aided by contractors, have been carrying out
the stonework repairs using lime mortar prepared in the traditional
manner in purpose-built new workshops.

WHAT an inaccurate and spiteful report by David Steele on the
all-women short list for Ayr Labour Party (August 30)! I wonder if he
would have taken such pains to rubbish every candidate if there had been
males on the short list.
Mr Steele seems to have made up his mind what the outcome of the
selection will be, based apparently on information provided by some
unnamed ''party insider'' (a disappointed male wannabe, I suspect).
May I reassure supporters of those of us he has written off that there
is every point in turning up to vote on Sunday, September 10. You will
find that I, for one, am a much stronger contender than his article
implies. I would not have put myself through the selection process if I
did not have every intention of giving it my best shot.
I recall that it was The Herald who predicted the Tories would win
South Ayrshire Council 13 to 12 (Labour won 21 to 4).
Just shows you can't believe everything you read in the papers.

I WAS surprised to hear that Charles Kennedy was amused to learn that
the bagpipes were the national musical instrument of Estonia. When the
Baltic states were known as Livland and Courland they were a magnet for
emigrants, especially from the east coast of Scotland. As early as the
days of the Teutonic Knights Scots mercenaries joined the Brotherhood of
the Sword and as a reward were given extensive estates in what is now
Estonia.
Scots trading ships called at all the ports and eventually merchants
settled in the hinterland, followed by ''rogues, vagabonds, and
pedlars''. Indeed the Scots pedlar was a familiar sight with his wooden
box on his back.
Later, in the interminable wars, thousands of Scots mercenaries poured
in to sell their swords -- and bagpipe music? -- to the petty warlords.
Linguists can tell us that many of the Baltic names are corruptions of
the original Scots settlers' names.
Most people think of German settlers in the Baltic but as usual the
ubiquitous Scots were there along with them.

AS the mother of a mentally handicapped son I found it very heartening
to read Sam Galbraith's article, Outwith these walls (August 25).
Heartening because it may be that the view of such a well-known,
respected person will have some effect on the powers that be.
My son has been resident in hospital for 26 years. I speak and write
for him as he cannot do so for himself. It is my opinion that he could
not cope with ''living in the community''. That is why we had to have
him placed in residence.
He is one of those persons who need their own community with
independent, good conditions within an enclosed environment such as a
village community.
This could have been set up within the hospital grounds but alas, part
of the grounds has already been sold off and I understand the hospital
will be closed some time in the future. So much uncertainty for parents
and relatives!
I know many other parents are of the same opinion as myself and are
very concerned about their ''children's'' future. If the community
environment (or care as it is called) is too hostile and irrelevant to
their needs, where can they be placed if the hospital and beds are sold?
It is certainly time to call a halt and think again.

After a year of the ceasefire Northern Ireland is facing an issue
which could derail the peace process, writes Russell Edmunds
WHAT can be done about the terrorist arms in Northern Ireland? As the
first anniversary of the IRA ceasefire passed on Thursday, the issue
threatened to derail the peace and overshadowed what should have been a
joyous occasion for a province with 25 years of bloody terrorism behind
it.
Instead, any celebration was spoiled by a deep concern among
Protestants and Catholics that the arms issue could not be solved. To
British Government Ministers and Unionists, the demand that weapons be
handed over or decommissioned is a point of principle. To Irish
nationalists and the IRA's political support in Sinn Fein, such an
attitude is unacceptable.
The divisions over decommissioning were starkly illustrated when
Northern Ireland Minister Michael Ancram -- a key player in political
talks -- clashed on Ulster Television with one of the great architects
of the peace deal, former Irish Premier Albert Reynolds.
''It's surrender. Handing over arms is surrender. Surrender is victory
for one and defeat for another,'' said Reynolds, who signed the Downing
St Peace Declaration with John Major in December 1993.
''We're not looking for surrender,'' responded Ancram, claiming the
IRA's refusal to decommission its arms was harming trust.
''To hang the whole lot on decommissioning is wrong,'' retorted
Reynolds.
''I'm not hanging the whole lot on decommissioning,'' said Ancram.
''Well, that is what it boils down to. I tell you, you've got it
wrong.''
It was an unseemly public disagreement but it underscored what a wedge
has been driven between London and Dublin, and Unionists and
nationalists over the question of weapons.
The British view is that democratic parties cannot be expected to
negotiate with people who have guns under the table. All-party talks
have no hope because Unionists will not come to any negotiating table in
such circumstances, says Ancram.
Nationalists argue that there is no historical precedent in Ireland
for the handing over of weapons in advance of a political settlement.
They point also to South Africa and the Middle East where disarmament
was not a pre-condition.
On Monday, Ancram and Secretary of State Sir Patrick Mayhew face a
difficult meeting with Sinn Fein's Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness.
Arms and the IRA are certain to be top of the agenda.
After a year of skirting around this enormous hurdle, only one plan
seems feasible, and ironically it has its origins with the security
spokesman of the Ulster Unionist Party, Ken Maginnis.
While Mr Maginnis spends next week vying for the Unionist leadership
as one of the favourites to succeed James Molyneaux, his proposal for an
''international commission'' to oversee the decommissioning of terrorist
weapons will be centre stage, first at the crucial Stormont talks and
then at a summit meeting in London between John Major and Irish leader
John Bruton.
The summit is expected to announce the terms of reference for the
weapons commission on Wednesday as the means of bolstering the
north'sflagging peace process. At the same time, Major and Bruton will
exhort all the parties involved to renew their efforts for peace and
enter into a new round of talks with the British and Irish governments.
No-one other than the British and Irish officials who have been
struggling over the summer to agree this formula really knows how an
international arms commission might operate. At worst it may prove a
clever smokescreen to cloud the fact that disarming either the IRA or
Loyalist groups is an impossible task. At best, it may reassure the
law-abiding population that something is being done.
How something can be done is baffling. Talking to Sinn Fein is one
thing; meeting the outlawed quartermasters of the IRA or Loyalist terror
groups is quite another.
The man with the unenviable task of leading this exercise is thought
likely to be George Mitchell, a former American senator who is President
Bill Clinton's special economic envoy to Ireland.
This weekend Mitchell is said to be examining the proposal that he
should take charge of an international and independent team charged with
finding a way through the Irish weapons maze.
First though, Mayhew and Ancram will have to persuade Adams and
McGuinness to cooperate, and the signs last week were anything but
favourable.
''If the establishment of an international commission is an attempt to
achieve an IRA surrender by the back door then Sinn Fein will have no
part of it and the policy is doomed to failure,'' warned McGuinness on
Thursday.
Despite that, the pressure from America and from Dublin is on Sinn
Fein to buy the commission idea in tandem with a promise to engage all
parties in more substantive talks about the political way forward.
That should be enough to lock in Sinn Fein and to end the immediate
deadlock on the arms issue.
But where the weapon hideouts are, who controls them and what is
actually hidden in them is a mystery even to security forces on both
sides of the Irish border. It is assumed that the IRA has caches of arms
and explosives mainly in the Irish Republic concealed in remote rural
locations.
Somehow, members of the commission must make contact with the outlawed
organisations on both sides, probably through the political channels
such as Sinn Fein, and then negotiate a hand-over of some weapons.
Loyalist groups say they will co-operate in decommissioning if the IRA
does, but the problem of striking a balance between the different groups
will also need addressing.
A further complication is that the IRA equates itself with the
security forces, and its supporters argue that even if the Loyalist
extremists handed in all their weapons the Army and RUC would still hold
an unacceptable arsenal.
The complexities of the arms problem could lead an international
commission down a long, long road. Finding agreement on decommissioning
weapons may prove just as complicated as the search for common political
ground.
After a year of peace, Northern Ireland is only now facing up to the
practical consequences of preserving and building upon it.

DUMBARTON is a place you won't easily miss, with its massive 250-ft
high castle rock. Standing on the verge of Loch Lomond, it has become an
important tourist centre, and has done a lot to lift its image in recent
years,with the cleaning up of the banks of the River Leven and clearing
away of rotting hulks which lay in the river for many years.
Almost in the centre of Dumbarton is Levengrove Park, once the home of
the famous printing family of Dicksons. It is well worth a visit today
with its lovely setting, for it has high quality bedding.
When I visited the park recently, I was met by contracts manager for
the District Council, Drew Thornton and charge hand gardener, Bobby
McLeish.
Plants for Levengrove, Helensburgh, Alexandria and Luss, are all
raised in the central nursery at Levengrove, and new glasshouses are
shortly to be built to improve production capacities.
Asked what he thought of contracting out -- when local authorities
must ask for tenders from private commercial firms to provide plants and
services -- Drew was happy to tell me they had won the contract for a
further five years.
In his view it had done a lot to improve the quality of local
authority bedding displays up and down the country.
Meanwhile, the domestic gardener has to recognise that August to
September can be treacherous for disease. Warm in the day, with heavy
dew and high humidity at night means rapid development of grey mould or
botrytis.
Tomatoes can be infected and drop off. Side shoots can die back, and
the whole plant is doomed when the disease has ringed the main stem.
Strip off as much foliage as reasonable, and let air in and around the
base. Keep ventilation on night and day. If things get really bad, spray
with a general fungicide.
Pot plants can also be attacked also. It may be advisable to bring
them into the home rather than leave them at risk.
Lawns should make some slow recovery after the severe burning they
have had. Don't be tempted to do anything drastic like putting on
fertiliser, until there is some sign of good regrowth.
Outside containers, including hanging baskets, will tend to lose a lot
of their vigour in the next few weeks. You must decide what their future
is.
There may be lots of plants you wish to save. To keep them in the
greenhouse over winter, frost protection will be necessary.
Alternatively, bring cuttings into the home for rooting and growing on
in small pots.
Time also to prune vigorous shrubs, without worrying too much about
old or new wood. Cut them into shape, particularly when they overhang
paths or lawns. But don't prune gooseberries yet. They are better left
until February or March.
It has been a busy time in the vegetable garden also, and it still
takes a lot to beat fresh produce from your own garden.
But let's face it, growing vegetables can be hard work. You have
problems of clubroot, slugs, root fly, caterpillars and so on, not
forgetting weeds.
This is an ideal time to review production plans for next year. Every
so often, I have a sabbatical year. Except for a few salads, I rest
ground. Not fallow, of course. Put the ground to a green manuring crop
like rape, vetches or Italian rye grass, to put goodness back into it.
Gardeners often ask about bare fallowing ground, leaving it completely
bare of crops for a season. It means hoeing off weeds as they appear or
using a contact weed killer.
The trouble is that, while it reduces the weeds, you do not improve
the physical nature of the soil.

THIS engrossing one-woman show by Lisa Daniely dissects the
fascinating life of Theroigne de Mericourt, heroine of the French
Revolution.
Told in flashback, from the grim setting on La Salpetiere asylum where
Theroigne was confined for the last 15 years of her life, Daniely evokes
a colourful past from a childhood on a pig farm in the Ardennes to high
society courtesan in London, Paris and Rome, to volatile and incredibly
vocal proponent of women's rights.
Rigorously researched, it is thrilling to hear the speeches of this
feisty feminist, portrayed with great vigour and panache, despite the
occasional flustering lapses, by Daniely. More tragic than Theroigne's
desperate end is that Daniely has been attracting meagre audiences. Her
bravura performance deserves more.

THE Collective is that rarity, a manufactured band that found a
meaningful existence beyond the few gigs for which it was initially
formed in the late 1980s before fading from view when its nominal leader
departed for sunnier climes in Costa Hibsless.
With his return the band is using this residency to play itself back
into shape for a tour later this year, exploring its hard bop roots
rather than the more contemporary side of its repertoire.
Although still a bit rusty, they captured Horace Silver's gospel
groove perfectly on Blues for No-one, with the soloing, particularly
from guitarist Kevin Mackenzie and pianist Brian Kellock, first rate.
They play two gigs daily (2pm and 8pm) until Saturday and are well worth
checking out.

FOR all the bullish determination of President Jacques Chirac, the
French Government is facing next week's rentree, the post-holiday return
to schools and jobs, with considerable apprehension.
Members may have drawn encouragement from last week's air strikes in
Bosnia as President Chirac was one of the most aggressive of European
leaders as regards that conflict.
However Prime Minister Alain Juppe has been made to appear silly and
politically weakened by his sacking last week of Finance Minister Alain
Madelin, the most influential man in his Cabinet who was to have
spearheaded a comprehensive range of fiscal and financial reforms.
More than half of people in a recent poll did not believe Mr Juppe's
government capable of fulfilling the president's election promises on
unemployment and poverty.
The technocratic Mr Juppe and the impulsive, very right-wing Mr
Madelin were never exactly friends, and the Prime Minister had strained
their relationship before the holidays by excluding his minister from
certain decisions. However the sacking of Mr Madelin, who had refused to
do the honourable thing and fall on his sword, is far more than just an
embarrassing squabble.
Mr Madelin had claimed that his measures, very reminiscent of what the
Tories introduced in Britain, were vital to boost France's economy and
mop up unemployment. Last month, however, he said so in such
undiplomatic language that the unions roared and Mr Juppe, already
irritated by his hot-headed minister, took fright and flung out baby and
bathwater.
Mr Madelin's successor, Jean Arthuis, is a centre-right man.
Commenting on the change, the Wall Street Journal, a great champion of
liberal economics, moaned that all hope of positive economic change in
France had now gone.
Mr Madelin had wanted to tackle head-on the enormous State machine
which right-wing economists believe is stifling growth in France; it
provides one in five jobs and handles more than half the gross national
product. Mr Madelin's first proposal, astonishingly tactless in the wake
of the Chirac promises on unemployment and immediately rejected by Mr
Juppe, had been to get rid of 30,000 civil servants.
Mr Madelin also hoped to scrap income tax privileges affecting 116
professions to earn the State an extra #12 billion. Thee money saved, he
argued, would have allowed him to reduce the top rate of income tax from
over 50% to just over 40%.
Overall, President Chirac's post-election honeymoon has not been a
happy one and opinion polls can come up with no precedent for a freshly
elected president slipping quite so quickly from favour. The sacking of
Mr Madelin has been greeted with malicious satisfaction by those close
to former Prime Minister and former conservative presidential candidate,
Edouard Balladur, who this week launches an election campaign to get
himself back into the National Assembly.

A SPECIAL award to Alison McMorland and Margaret Bennett. No, make
that two. One for singing on undaunted while the Festival fireworks did
their best to drown them out, the other for singing on undaunted when
the Festival fireworks had done their best to rob them of an audience.
For those few who preferred quieter entertainment on Thursday this
pair served up an enjoyable collection of songs in tribute to womanhood.
Songs of survival, we heard uttered more than once; not in any
drum-beating sense, more a case of quiet resolution mixed with knowing
humour and an acknowledgement that where women in folk songs are often
victims, it's not always at the hands of men.
In the Swan Swims Sae Bonnie, sisters -- to paraphrase Annie Lennox --
are doing it to each other; in Isabel Farewell, to their children.
Elsewhere, McMorland and Bennett sang, sweetly and in turn, of arranged
marriages, early widowhood (sometimes both in the same song), the curse
of strong drink, and falling for plooman -- or was that an exasperated
bloomin'? -- laddies. Lest we got lost in some bucolic romantic haze,
however, McMorland jolted us back to present-day realities with a feisty
and sobering reminder that ''love'' can hurt, literally.
The sparse attendance at this concert was very much the exception in a
stimulating series. In the past Scottish traditional music has had
little recognition in the official Festival while more exotic traditions
have been imported. Well, believe it not, to foreign visitors our
indigenous songs are exotic, and some of the characters who've been
singing them here are, to my mind, our equivalent of the great Delta
Blues singers.
The quality of performance, with the odd exception, has been ''way
beyond what you might reasonably expect from so-called part-timers and
even if, as one wag suggested, these concerts have been the late-night
equivalent for tourists of a souvenir stick of rock, so be it.
The sight of people of all ages and many nationalities holding SRO
tickets, jostling for a good position on the stairs, sometimes
struggling with the language but almost without fail becoming engrossed,
has been my personal hit of this Festival. We've got the songs, we've
got the singers, and a series such as this deserves to be a regular
feature. Over to you, Mr McMaster.

<HEADLINE>Prison colleagues blame lack of support. 'Scapegoat' ex-governor resigns</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

THE former governor of Parkhurst prison has resigned from the prison
service weeks before the publication of a report into the break-out
staged by three men serving life sentences at the jail.
The Prison Governors Association said the Government had made John
Marriott a scapegoat for the break-out, and the loss of one of the
country's best governors showed the general loss of confidence in the
service and the Government.
''There's no sense that John's going because he feels he's going to be
pilloried. He's going because he's fallen out of love with the service
as many others are doing,'' said association general secretary David
Roddan.
The Prison Service confirmed that Mr Marriott had resigned after 25
years in the service. He is to become general manager of mental health
with Isle of Wight community healthcare trust.
Mr Marriott has been involved in non-operational duties since being
removed from his post at Parkhurst in January, after two convicted
murderers and an arsonist escaped using a replica master key. The men
were recaptured days later.
After the escape, Home Secretary Michael Howard outraged prison
governors with a pledge that Mr Marriott would never run a jail again.
However, Prison Service director Derek Lewis denied such a ban existed
and praised Mr Marriott's ''dedication, humanity, courage, and
innovation''.
Sir John Learmount is expected to publish his report on the escape and
the most comprehensive review yet of security in British jails next
month, but it is thought he will reserve his strongest criticism for Mr
Lewis.
Mr Roddan said Mr Marriott was regarded by his peers as one of the
country's best governors and his resignation was a great loss to the
prison service.
He said there was a common feeling among governors that they were not
getting enough support from the Government and the Prisons Board.
''Matters will not improve while Ministers and others respond to
crises by resorting to dishonourable behaviour like scapegoating,'' he
said.
''We all work with limited resources. That's a fact of life and we
shouldn't try to hide that fact. Limited resources were a significant
contributor to what happened in Parkhurst.
''John Marriott had been calling for the introduction of fence alarms
for five years. We think that Learmount will say if those alarms had
been in place the escape would not have happened.''
Mr Roddan said the association expected the Learmount report to
criticise people throughout the service but particularly Mr Lewis and
the directors.
''From what Learmount has told us, he believes the governor was in an
impossible situation and in the circumstances the escape was almost
inevitable,'' he said.
* Warders at a prison have passed an ovewhelming vote of no confidence
in their governor.
The Gloucester Prison ballot was called by the Prison Officers
Association, which says staffing levels at the jail are dangerously low.
Officers voted by 40 to 1 to support a motion saying they had no
confidence in Mr Peter Winkley, who is being blamed for a fall in
staffing over the last few months.
POA branch chairman Peter Hall said yesterday budget cutbacks were
putting staff -- and ultimately the public -- at risk of security
breaches.

DON'T call us, we've gone home. Come to that, so have you in all
likelihood. Certainly over this weekend you, dear young thespian, will
be striking the set and packing the props and quitting the Festival City
for another year. So it is now too late for you to trash that phonecard
on calls to artsdesks extolling the virtues of your revised version of
The Winter's Tale set in the rave scene of Ibiza with a soundtrack by
Ozric Tentacles.
It is not that I haven't enjoyed hearing from you. In fact modesty
forbids my revealing the amazement with which my colleagues have
remarked on my unfailing politeness to Fringe company actors and
directors who have rung the phone molten over the past three weeks. Hey,
we all have a job to do. Courtesy costs nothing, it's nice to be nice
etc etc.
From our mercifully cool basement in The Herald's office in heatwave
Edinburgh, forth have sallied our intrepid team of reviewers. Yea, even
when dropping from post-functional exhaustion. I have counted them out
and counted them back in, and occasionally the two totals tallied. In
modern hi-tech journalism terms our offices rather defined the aid
agency term ''appropriate technology'' -- a cluster of temperamental
laptop computers and a few added telephone extensions have been the
tools of our trade.
I even had a telephone answering machine -- an excellent device which
makes rehearsal tapes of the lobbying thesps and allows the critical ear
to assess at leisure whether the voice is up to grabbing the attention
of a tired hack sitting in a sauna on a wooden bench at four in the
afternoon. The purchase of a jar of coffee was all we needed to make
life complete -- and the chief executive of Caledonian Mr Liam Kane did
tell me (in front of witnesses) not to worry too much about the
expenses.
* THAT remark -- my favourite one-liner on the Fringe -- came at the
first of our award ceremonies at the Festival Theatre. Along with the
lavish party at the National Gallery, the presentation of the Herald
Angels has made this newspaper's presence in the East rather more
visible than in the past. Industry-watchers will doubtless have there
own theories about this.
For myself, it has been a privilege to meet some of the people who
have been providing the highest standard of work in the festivals and
tell them to their face how great they are. There is in each of us a fan
that never dies. But I retain as great an affection for the companion
pieces to the Angels, the Little Devils.
That is partly because they are an inspired creation by sculptor Allan
Ross but mainly because they give an opportunity to give a flavour of
what Edinburgh in August is all about. Tales of misfortune, ingenuity,
sacrifice, and dogged determination abound and only a proportion of them
ever reach the media, the plethora of Festival Diaries in newspapers
notwithstanding. As a measured contribution to Edinburgh's hype
overload, the Little Devil is hard to beat and somewhat more considered
than the regular utterings of Councillor Moira Knox.
* I FEAR the perennially-shocked councillor has been upstaged recently
by the kirk in Caithness. Oor ain Arches Theatre Company were invited to
perform at the Northlands festival -- a pan-North Sea event beginning
this month. Originally they were asked to restage Andy Arnold's
production of Chekhov Anecdotes, but the size of cast required for one
of the three tales prohibited that.
The Northlands folk then suggested the company bring its Fringe hit
revival of Sexual Perversity in Chicago. The invitation was declined,
but that did not stop the Rev Bill Wallace going ballistic about the
spending of public money on what was described in a tabloid paper as
''an x-rated sex show''. I repeat this only in the hope that it may
eventually reach the ears of author David Mamet, who surely would be
amused to hear his witty play decribed as a pornographic shocker.
* LASTLY, a suggestion as to what the thinking film-buff will be
wearing in a few years' time. It is inspired by Drambuie Film Festival
Director Mark Cousins, a chap so admired and popular that it seems
obscene to point out that he is in fact a clever, handsome, and likeable
bloke who programmed what was, by all accounts, a very fine first
festival.
When Cousins was a student at Stirling University it was the same
story -- that combination of popularity and academic success that would
be nauseating if he wasn't so damned charming. After he left the campus,
I am told by one who was there, one of his acolytes took to wearing a
t-shirt he had had specially made. It read: ''Who was Mark Cousins
anyway?''
How, dear thespian, very like the way one feels about Edinburgh after
three weeks. Until next year.

ONLY the Russians could turn alcoholism into a philosophy, a religion,
not just a way of life but a whole attitude to it. And perhaps only the
Polish could turn it into quite such a brooding piece of theatre.
This is a return visit by Poland's Theatre Kana with a staging of
Venedikt Yerofeev's picaresque tale about an intellectual drunk that
also saw light in the form of Moscow Stations starring Tom Courtenay on
last year's Fringe.
Knowledge of the Courtenay version is a help through this version's
more existential musings, and it does start to drag on its inevitable
maudlin descent but it is worth it to see the rich performances as the
production lurches from hedonism to hellishness and back.

<HEADLINE>Call for unity after fishermen reject breakaway</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>GRAEME SMITH</BYLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>976584908</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A PLEA for unity among Scotland's fishermen was made last night after
the long-standing threat of a split within the major catchers'
organisation was averted.
At a special meeting in Banff, the Scottish White Fish Producers'
Association (SWFPA) decided by a small majority against breaking away
from the Scottish Fishermen's Federation (SFF).
However, that decision may now lead to the possibility of breakaway
groups within the association.
The conflict has arisen over the SFF's refusal to back the Save
Britain's Fish Campaign, which is urging Britain's withdrawal from the
EU Common Fisheries Policy.
The campaign has been backed by the SFF's English counterpart, the
National Association of Fishermen's Federations, and the SWFPA has been
a long-term supporter.
The issue is the most controversial in the history of the two
organisations and, yesterday, SWFPA chairman Tom Hay and vice-chairman
John Thomson survived a vote of no confidence.
It is the first time there has been a vote on a possible split from
the SFF and the gravity of the situation was indicated by the fact that
33 of the 34 directors were present or represented by a legally
appointed proxy at the meeting, several having returned specifically
from fishing trips.
The vote was 18-14, with one abstention.
Mr Roddy McColl, SWFPA secretary, said: ''There was a majority vote by
the directors in favour of remaining within the Scottish Fishermen's
Federation.''
Although the association remains within the federation, there are many
fishermen who disagree passionately with the federation's policy on the
Save Britain's Fish Campaign.
The directors will now return to the branches and report the outcome
and the fishermen will decide their reaction to this vote.
The association represents around 500 boat owners and 2500 Scottish
fishermen.
Peterhead and Fraserburgh are expected to be the ports which would
lead any rebellion against the SWFPA but the fishermen will be urged to
think carefully about the implications of any breakaway and the lobbying
power which a small group might be able to achieve.
Calling for unity last night, Ms Trudy Johnston, of the SFF, said:
''Unity has been our strength in the past and the decision allows us to
get on with the business of representing the interests of Scottish
fishermen.''

IT has all the odds stacked against them -- end-of-festival fatigue
and lack of funds chief among them. This production by Glasgow's
Castlemilk Youth Complex lacks professionalism in some areas, but it has
no trouble raising a scream at the appropriate moment.
The plot is a below-stairs thriller. The servants have eased the shock
of their mistress's death by removing her jewellery to a place of safety
in their own pockets. But to their terror the kitchen bell which
connects to her bedroom starts to ring.
Margaret Skibington is a charmingly slow Twilley, the scullery maid
who as the lowest of the low is sent to investigate, while Nicola
Hutcheon as the brandy swilling cook, though rather young and slim for
the stereotype, gives a dynamic performance.

THERE is hope for the O J Simpson jury, and the millions worldwide who
are sick of the case: the defence will probably wind up next week and
the jury might actually start to consider a verdict this month.
All this because the judge, Lance Ito, has ruled that the defence
cannot spend the next fortnight attacking a police officer called as a
prosecution witness.
Mark Fuhrman was one of the first policemen on the scene of the crime,
and found a pair of blood-stained gloves, one near the bodies, the other
at Mr Simpson's house. The defence has tried to argue that Mr Fuhrman is
a racist and perjurer who planted the evidence.
It also claims that either Mr Fuhrman or one of his colleagues smeared
samples of Mr Simpson's blood around the site of the murders, and
samples of the victims' blood on Mr Simpson's car, in his house, and on
socks in his bedroom.
Their case would be much strengthened if the judge had allowed the
celebrated Fuhrman tapes to be played to the jury, but he has ruled them
irrelevant.
Mr Fuhrman denied on the witness stand that he had used the word
''nigger'' in the past decade. Now a screen-writer has produced tapes of
a series of interviews in which he uses the word repeatedly, reveals
himself to be a vicious racist, and boasts of beating prisoners and
forcing false confessions from them.
The judge ruled that ''the underlying assumption requires a leap in
both law and logic that is too broad to be made upon the evidence before
the jury''. In other words, the defence claim that Mr Fuhrman and the
police planted the evidence is preposterous.
However, since Mr Fuhrman lied when he denied saying ''nigger'' in the
past decade, the judge allows the defence to play one use of the word
from the tapes and to permit the screen-writer to read from the
transcript of another usage.
Without its hoped-for grand finale, the defence will have to rest its
case, perhaps tonight, perhaps next week. Freedom will then be in sight
for the jury, which has been sequestered in a motel since January.

WE live in a world of illusions, willingly buying into and sustaining
them in dedicated acts of voluntary self-deception, a fact which
playwright Sacha Guitry, the darling of French boulevard theatre,
wittily played around with in his bubbly social comedy, written in 1917.
In this German translation for the Berlin-based Schaubune am Lehniner
Platz, director Luc Bondy, the man behind last year's Festival wonder
The Hour We Knew Nothing of Each Other, also emphasises our willing
participation in the act of illusion, with the dreamscapes of foreign
climes projected on to a backscreen during a patently insincere
seduction scene signalling the desire of the seductee to believe in a
false future.
The seductor is the eponymous illusionist, the Parisian Paul Dufresne,
who performs magic tricks as the Anglicised ''Teddy Brooks''; he bemoans
his inability to speak English but a variety-hall crone assures him:
''But you've mastered the accent, that's much more difficult than the
language.''
Such illusion is second nature to Dufresne, from sleight-of-hand card
tricks to juggling the women in his life -- Guitry eschewing the
potential high farce of the amorous adventures in favour of a stinging
script, which sardonically exposes the minxish tricks of men and women.
Gert Voss plays the illusionist with quicksilver grace and wit, as
dazzling while performing genuine gasp-inducing stunts as when romancing
with keen ardour -- and all the more laudable, considering he rose from
a hospital bed to perform.
It's a frothy, lightweight piece, which Bondy revels in, retaining its
gossamer appeal although he piles on visual gags and comic nuance and
gleefully plays up all the ironic twists. Vivacious and colourful, with
a quirky curtain-raising set (I won't spoil the surprise), it's short on
thrills but has oodles of charm.

IN all honesty, it is hard to understand the fuss that has been made
in certain quarters about the Camerata Academica of Salzburg, which made
its second and final appearance at the Edinburgh Festival last night. It
is a good enough chamber orchestra, which turned out acceptable-enough
performances of Schubert's First and Sixth Symphonies.
But the world is full of good chamber orchestras -- and it was
difficult not to imagine what might have happened last night if the
chamber orchestra involved had been Scotland's own. Frankly, sparks
might have flown, where last night, with the Salzburg orchestra, they
did not. And, odious though comparisons may be, what the Camerata
achieved with its two Schubert symphonies last night was totally
eclipsed by the breathtaking performance of another two, the night
before, by the NDR Orchestra from Hamburg.
Perhaps -- dare we suggest this -- the warmth of audience response
last night was, in some measure, a token towards the festival's oldest
conductor, 90-year-old Sandor Vegh, who, from a swivel chair, directed
his Austrian band in rather featureless and bland accounts of the
symphonies. Things, admittedly, did pick up a bit in the second half of
an overlong concert with the Sixth Symphony which, with a hint of some
sense of direction, a bit of bite in its first movement, a touch of
crispness in the second, Beethovenian bounce in the third, and wit in
the finale, at least felt like a symphony.
These features, along with a general sense of character, had been
missing not only in the first symphony, but they were -- tragically --
largely lacking in the performance of Mozart's last Piano Concerto with
the great Austrian pianist Alfred Brendel. The sense of bittiness and
lack of pace which generally affected the concert also infected
Brendel's concerto, which, despite typically clear, poetic, and
bell-like playing, rather drifted along. Like everything else last
night, it lacked sparkle and drive.
I don't know if Brendel settled for Sandor Vegh's lacklustre pace, but
his delivery (other than on a phrase-by-phrase basis) failed to project
any real continuity or momentum. A seriously disappointing concert.

A BUSINESSMAN was fined #15,000 yesterday for his part in a fraud
involving a multimillion-pound film which was never produced.
A jury convicted property developer Michael McLetchie, 38, of Islay
Drive, Newton Mearns, last month and he returned to the High Court in
Glasgow yesterday for sentencing.
His business partner, solicitor Euan McIlvride, 35, of Stewart Drive,
Glasgow, has been jailed for three years.
Father-of-two McLetchie was warned he faced a year's jail if he failed
to repay #32,000 to his victim's estate within 12 months.
The two men duped film producer Miss Kenteas Brine into giving them
#22,000 by promising they could raise #12m to bankroll her ill-fated
film which was to star Omar Sharif and Glenda Jackson.
Miss Brine had spent #1m building a film set, borrowing the money from
the late Sir John Anthony Langford-Holt, a former Tory MP.
The court was yesterday told that McLetchie would repay the money,
totalling #32,634 with interest, to Sir John's estate.
Defence advocate Miss Ruth Anderson said Sir John's widow was the only
person entitled to benefit from the estate.
In sentencing McLetchie, temporary judge Sheriff Alexander Wilkinson,
QC, described the operation as a ''sophisticated fraud''.
''The return of the money, plus interest, will not compensate those
for anxiety and suffering caused by your act,'' Sheriff Wilkinson said.
The jury rejected McLetchie's evidence that the money had been a loan
from Miss Brine five years ago.
McIlvridewas also found guilty of embezzling #3450 from a law firm and
from swindling a fishing boat skipper out of #13,244.
The trial lasted five weeks and cost an estimated #1m.

FRAMING the stage is a metal grid, partially lightly screened, which
forms a huge open eye through which we watch the action, irresistibly
imposing a sensation of voyeurism well suited to the sexual shenanigans
portrayed -- and also suggesting a crisp, clear focus to this impeccably
produced play; as he did in the opening scene of The Illusionist
director Luc Bondy is teasing at notions of audience.
The second offering of Berlin's Schaubuhne am Lehniner Platz's Guitry
double bill is an aspic comedy with sharply observed angles on the
eternal triangle; a wife (Libgart Schwarz) and husband (Peter
Simonischek) go to the home of a friend but on arrival the husband
excuses himself, his explanation of a meeting with a South American a
transparent alibi for a romantic assignation. Subsequently, the wife --
perhaps in pique? Perhaps from lust? -- agrees to return to the friend's
apartment that evening.
While this first act bristle with cryptic humour the second, an
extended monologue by the friend ''himself'' -- Otto Sander hilariously
realising a preening peacock of a man -- conjures up the anguish of
anticipation. Dorothy Parker captured this in agonising detail in her
short story about a woman awaiting a lover's phone call and her themes
are pre-dated in this earlier (1916) piece, with Himself predicting
every eventuality, from the time his lover will take in a taxi to her
appreciation of his tidy bedroom.
We've all been there. This is theatre of identification, and despite
the intensely arch performance style and the distansiating ''eye''
device -- which the actors eventually straddle and clamber over -- Bondy
gives us a heartfelt, vibrant production.
Lusciously designed, the apartment a chic pink marshmallow overlooking
picture-postcard Paris -- and gauzily lit it shares many of the themes
of The Illusionist, namely, an examination of the different things men
and women want from relationships and the shared dishonesties, although
the humour of this lively, highly accessible piece is more robust.
Ironically, in its similar depiction of romantic fantasties built and
dashed Let's Dream . . . has more bite.

JUST as Gunter Wand and his Hamburg orchestra have taken Edinburgh by
storm in the closing days of the festival, and brought a real sense of
occasion to the final events, so did Russian violinist Dmitry
Sitkovetsky in a scorching Queen's Hall recital yesterday morning.
He looks like an archetypal Russian hard man: squat, heavy set, with a
stance like a boxer or a weightlifter, surveying his audience with an
almost neutral, expressionless look on his face. His pianist, Pavel
Gililov, on the other hand, is a small, animated man with a shock of
grey hair and a perpetual and infectious grin on his face.
Together the two of them were dynamite. Not that it was immediately
evident. In an all-Russian programme -- undiluted stuff; no sweeties
given, no prisoners taken -- melody, though of the intense variety, was
the early over-riding factor in five pieces by Prokofiev.
Then the going got tough: Shostakovich, Schnittke, and Stravinsky.
Three different worlds, but each -- in terms of this performance -- with
something in common. Shostakovich's was an essentially interior world,
depicting his chilliest landscapes, bleakly painted by Sitkovetsky.
Schnittke's Sonata teetered on the edge of anarchy, its galumph and
grotesquerie thrown off by the master violinist with frightening elan.
And Stravinsky's horizons embraced the gamut from classical elegance to
ecstasy.
What they all had in common was at least one fast movement apiece:
raw, driving, requiring fearsome virtuosity -- and not just from the
violinist. Sitkovetsky and Gililov ripped through the fabric, each of
them shockingly abrasive (Gililov powering the engine with piledriver
pianism). Intense wasn't in it; a breathtaking display.

YOU have been in this pub before. It's the quiet one that caters to a
handful of regulars, low-achievers, balancing on the cusp of
friendliness and alcoholism, sometimes tottering over into a
half-hearted violence but more often than not just passing the time
behind another pint glass with another self-pitying conversation.
Familiar it may be, but no easy task to dramatise, and Benedick Cooper
demonstrates a subtle command of dialogue and plot structure in this
Guardian Student Award-winning play.
Taking the shape of a down-market Cherry Orchard, there is too little
variety in tone fully to sustain its length, but the characterisation is
strong and true, and the vision of a demoralised post-80s Britain is as
depressing as it well observed.

A JURY today convicted a 31-year-old former accountant of raping and
murdering two schoolgirls, closing one of Canada's most sordid and
sensational trials.
Paul Bernardo was accused of abducting the girls in separate episodes
in 1991 and 1992, forcing them to be sex slaves in front of a video
camera, and then strangling them.
Bernardo received concurrent life sentences for two first-degree
murder charges. Sentencing on seven other charges was to be discussed at
a hearing later this month.
Bernardo admitted that he and his then-wife, Karla Homolka, abducted
Leslie Mahaffy, 14, and Kristen French, 15, and sexually abused the
girls. However he denied killing them, and suggested they died
accidentally or during struggles with Homolka while he was not present.
The home videotapes the couple shot of the sexual abuse became key
evidence in the gripping trial. They showed Bernardo raping, beating,
and humiliating the girls, but not killing them.
Homolka, 25, testified that Bernardo strangled the girls with an
electrical cord. She struck a deal with the government to testify
against Bernardo and plead guilty to manslaughter in the murders, and is
serving a 12-year prison term.
The jury deliberated for seven hours before finding Bernardo guilty of
two counts each of murder, kidnapping, forcible confinement, and
aggravated sexual assault, and one count of committing an indignity to a
body.
The mothers of the two victims clasped hands as they waited for jurors
to file into the packed courtroom to give the verdicts. After the ninth
''guilty'', Mahaffy's mother, Debbie, burst into tears.
''Only the trial is over. Leslie is still not coming home,'' said her
father, Dan Mahaffy.
The verdicts came after a four-month trial in which jurors were
repeatedly exposed to some of the most gruesome, sexually explicit
evidence ever presented in a Canadian courtroom.
Courtroom spectators could hear, but not see, the graphic videotapes
that were shown to the jury. Some of those who were in court daily
covered their ears to block out the girls' anguished screams.
The most riveting testimony came from Bernardo, the only witness
called in his defence, and Homolka, the prosecution's star witness.
Homolka's plea agreement -- which was not revealed publicly until the
trial was under way -- became a central issue in the proceedings.
Defence lawyer John Rosen contended that Homolka misrepresented her role
in the deaths of Mahaffy and French to protect herself. Her
participation in the sexual assaults was starkly evident on the tapes,
which came to light after the deal.
Homolka said she was beaten and blackmailed into taking part in
Bernardo's depraved sexual fantasies. Bernardo's lawyers, however,
sought to portray her as a willing participant in the crimes, and as the
one who may have killed the girls, either on purpose or accidentally.
His lawyer, John Rosen, said Bernardo would appeal against conviction
which carries an automatic penalty of life imprisonment with no
eligibility for parole for 25 years. Canada has no death penalty.
A crowd waited outside the courthouse and one man called out after the
verdict was announced ''All we need now is a rope.''--AP/Reuter.

FRIENDS of South African President Nelson Mandela say they expect him
to remarry soon.
Mandela made a renewed attempt this week to initiate a divorce from
his estranged wife, Winnie, his lawyer said.
Three sources close to Mandela, who has lived alone for more than
three years, have said in the past week that he wants a divorce because
he plans to remarry.
Mandela, 77, is said to have a close relationship with Graca Machel,
widow of Mozambican president Samora Machel, who died in a plane crash a
decade ago.
The president's lawyer, Ismail Ayob, filed documents in the Rand
Supreme Court in Johannesburg yesterday alleging that Winnie Mandela was
dodging court officials trying to serve a summons to open divorce
proceedings.
He applied for permission to deliver the documents to her lawyer
rather than to her personally. A court official said the application
would be heard on Tuesday.
Mandela divorced his first wife, Evelyn, to marry Winnie in 1958. He
was arrested by the apartheid regime four years later and remained in
prison until February 1990.
The couple separated formally in April 1992 after Mrs Mandela was
convicted of complicity in the kidnapping and assault of black children
in Soweto.
Ayob confirmed last month that lawyers were discussing a divorce based
on an irreconcilable breakdown but a member of Mrs Mandela's staff said
she would contest the action.
''She won't accept it because she knows it is a political attempt to
undermine her. She says he can live with anyone he likes, but he can't
have a divorce,'' the aide said.--Reuter.

BRITAIN yesterday indicated it was likely to end all nuclear testing
and rely instead on computer simulation.
Officials said the Government was expected to fall into line with the
United States, which backs a genuine ''zero'' test ban.
The Ministry of Defence has long argued to retain the right to carry
out low-yield tests.
However, America's moratorium on nuclear testing in the Nevada Desert,
where Britain has carried out its tests in recent years, effectively
puts an end to British plans.
Despite the current row over tests in the South Pacific, France has
said it will give full support to a total test ban treaty once its
present tests are concluded.
A Ministry of Defence spokeswoman said: ''We are considering how to
meet this important requirement in a test-free world and in the light of
the conclusions reached by the US and France.''
Russia is expected to agree to a total ban but the position of China
is not clear.

<HEADLINE>Inquiry told how boy died under van</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE driver of an ice-cream van panicked when he realised a
five-year-old boy had fallen under the wheels of his vehicle, a fatal
accident inquiry at Edinburgh Sheriff Court heard yesterday.
Mark Smith died of suffocation after being trapped under a back wheel
of the van near his home in Edinburgh on September 26 last year.
Driver James Hadden, 23, from Newtongrange, told Sheriff Roger Craik,
QC, that he had started to push from the driver's door. ''I tried to
push it but I couldn't budge it,'' he said.
He then shouted to the boy's nine-year-old friend Peter Quin to get
help and began sounding his horn to attract attention.
Several months later, Mr Hadden again drove an ice- cream van but gave
up after a few days. ''I couldn't face doing it because of the
accident,'' he told the inquiry.
Van owner Rudolph Arcari, 66, told the sheriff that the 21-year-old
Bedford vehicle would not be used again.
''Having been involved in a fatal accident, I don't think it is right
that it should go back on the road,'' he said.
The inquiry heard that Mark, of Great Carleton Square, Edinburgh, and
friend Peter Quin, of nearby Niddrie House Drive, ran to the van as it
entered Great Carleton Place at about 6.45pm.
Peter claimed that Mark had dropped a 20p piece and the van reversed
on top of him as he tried to find it.
However, Mr Hadden denied reversing and said the boy fell under the
wheels as he ran alongside the van which was drawing up to the kerb.
Pathologist Dr Anthony Busuttil said the accident was unusual as the
boy died of suffocation because of the pressure of the two-tonne van on
his chest. He did not suffer any injury to his bones or organs.
Professor Busuttil said grazes on the boy's body meant it was more
likely the van had been reversing when it ran over him but stressed that
the evidence was far from conclusive.
Sheriff Craik said he would probably make a formal finding but would
issue his determination in writing later.
He told the dead boy's parent's they had the sympathy of the court.
''It is a tragic business to lose a child of this age, particularly in
these circumstances,'' he said.

A BRITISH holidaymaker was among two who died and 35 others injured
when a coach heading for a Turkish airport was involved in a head-on
crash with a minibus today.
The dead Briton was named by the British Embassy as Mrs Rita Williams,
who was born in Tunbridge Wells, Kent.
Her 16-year-old daughter, Faye, suffered a serious eye injury and a
man had serious facial injuries.
First Choice holidays, based in Sussex, said most of the passengers
were from the Midlands.
They had been travelling towards Dalaman airport on the south-west
coast and were due to catch a flight back to Birmingham airport.
The accident happened at midnight when the coach collided with the
minibus and both vehicles were later hit by a car being driven by an
Italian, who was also injured.
The victims were taken to three nearby hospitals. Nineteen of the
passengers were treated and have flown back to Britain.
Fourteen others were being examined in a private clinic for what was
thought to be minor cuts and bruises.
The accident was in the town of Koycegis where three Scots travelling
with another British firm were killed in a similar accident in June.

<TEXT>
SCOTTISH Secretary Michael Forsyth last night asked film actor Mel
Gibson, star of Braveheart, for advice on an international strategy to
put Scotland on the film-makers' map.
Mr Forsyth spoke to the actor at a dinner in Edinburgh Castle two days
before the film's European premiere on Sunday evening at the MacRobert
Theatre in Stirling University. Around 700 guests will watch the
Hollywood version of the life of William Wallace before attending a
private party at Stirling Castle.
Speaking before the dinner, Mr Forsyth said: ''The film industry has
great potential value for Scotland and I am anxious that the Government
does everything in its power to support it. Scotland has had a
remarkably good record in recent years in the making of films, both
large-scale feature films made by overseas companies and local films of
a smaller scale.
''I am delighted to welcome this trend for its economic impact and for
its impact on creative jobs in Scotland and I want to do what I can to
encourage its further expansion.''
He said Scotland was clearly attractive to international film-makers
from the beauty and variety of its landscape to the ease of
communications. He praised Scottish Screen Locations which had done an
excellent job in assisting film-makers find the locations and facilities
they wanted.
The organisation has attracted around #23m of investment in the past
five years.
Mr Forsyth said one of the complaints of movie-makers was that it was
difficult to raise necessary investment. The National Lottery presented
a new source of funds, with #1.2m of awards for film projects announced
last week.
The Scottish Secretary outlined his plans to build on recent successes
in attracting film-makers to Scotland. He said Scottish Enterprise and
Highlands and Islands Enterprise would be asked to find the best way to
promote Scotland to film-makers.
Lord Lindsay, Minister for the Arts in Scotland, would maintain a
dialogue with the film industry, and film-makers all over the world
would be given access to information about Scotland on the Internet.
Meanwhile, the Scottish National Party is to mount a recruitment
campaign to cash in on the launch of the film. Recruitment leaflets
headed Independence isn't just history are to be handed out at cinemas
throughout Scotland.
SNP vice-president Paul Scott said: ''The Scottish National Party's
message is that, while Wallace's life and times were very different from
our own, the need for independence is greater than ever.''

A ROW has flared up over a statement by Industry Minister George
Kynoch that the Government has no plan at present to review the map of
assisted areas following the impending closure of the US Navy base at
RAF Edzell, near Brechin, with the expected loss of hundreds of jobs.
East Angus MP Andrew Welsh said yesterday: ''There has clearly been a
lack of urgency on the Government's part in this matter. The base is
located in the Industry Minister's own constituency, yet he appears
either unwilling or unable to come up with an appropriate response to
this jobs crisis.''
Mr Kynoch had stated that the possible designation of the Brechin area
as an assisted one would depend on the economic circumstances when the
Government reviewed the assisted areas map.
Meantime, they had no plan for such a review in the near future.
Yesterday, Mr Welsh said: ''The Industry Minister's stance reeks of
inertia and a lack of any knowledge of the problems faced by the people
who will lose their jobs at Edzell.
''It is clear that positive action is needed to ensure that the
closure does not leave a gaping hole in the local economy by adding to
the already too high unemployment figure for Angus.''

FRANCE seized two Greenpeace protest ships near its South Pacific
nuclear testing site today and said this spelt the end of attempts to
disrupt its forthcoming nuclear tests.
Navy commandos stopped the environmental group's flagship Rainbow
Warrior after it sailed into a 12-mile exclusion zone around the Mururoa
atoll and sent dinghies and two divers into the lagoon testing site.
They later seized the MV Greenpeace outside the exclusion zone after
its helicopter had flown over the banned zone.
Admiral Philippe Euverte, head of the navy in the South Pacific, said
Greenpeace's dinghies had been seized and two divers who managed to slip
into the lagoon were ''gently'' arrested when they surfaced.
A navy spokesman said no-one was hurt.
The environmental group claimed its divers had slipped underneath the
platform at the Mururoa atoll test site.
The French, however, denied that the divers had reached the test
platform.
Euverte said they had dived near an operational barge and were
constantly under control.
''There was never anyone where the blast will take place,'' he said.
French Defence Minister Charles Millon said on television in Paris
that the two Greenpeace vessels were being towed away from the area.
Euverte said it meant defeat for Greenpeace's bid to stop the planned
seven or eight underground tests at the Mururoa and Fangataufa atolls,
10,700 miles from mainland France.
''I don't think Greenpeace will be able to mount another operation,''
Euverte told TF1 television.
Millon said the Navy conducted the operation ''firmly and
courteously'' and would stop anyone trying to breach the exclusion zone.
''Let everyone know that breaching the 12-mile zone will mean facing
what Greenpeace has just lived through,'' he said.
''We recognise the right to protest, but we do not recognise the right
to break the law.''
Greenpeace, however, voiced its determination to continue the protest.
Xavier Pastor, a campaigner aboard the MV Greenpeace, said: ''This is
only the beginning . . . We have said we will do all we can to stop the
entire series of tests and this is just the first attempt.''
Greenpeace launched its operation after various reports said the first
nuclear blast breaking France's three-year-old nuclear testing
moratorium could be set off today.
However a senior official at the French Atomic Energy Commission (CEA)
said the campaign was unlikely to begin until next week. The Defence
Ministry said each blast would be announced only after it has been
carried out.
The tests, which President Jacques Chirac has said were needed to
maintain the credibility of France's nuclear strike force, are scheduled
between September and next May.
Police earlier broke up a banned Greenpeace anti-nuclear protest in
central Paris, briefly holding 260 people.
Greenpeace had planned to form a ''human chain'' to carry an anti-test
petition signed by some four million people in at least 35 countries
from the River Seine to Chirac's Elysee Palace 1[1/2] miles away.
Opinion polls show a majority of the French oppose the resumption of
tests. However the anti-nuclear fever gripping Pacific countries and
some north European states has not affected France, resulting in paltry
attendance at anti-nuclear rallies.
The French authorities and Greenpeace are old enemies.
Ten years ago French secret service agents blew up the first Rainbow
Warrior in Auckland harbour, New Zealand, and in June tear-gas wielding
commandos stormed the group's ship when it crossed the 12-mile line at
Mururoa.--Reuter.

ANNE SIMPSON looks at the range available to larger-figured women
ON the desks of fashion writers up and down the land there are letters
bristling with anger and frustration from les femmes fortes, France's
robust term for women of voluptuous nature. The targets of these women's
wrath are always those miserable wrap-around garments in a dirty
marshmallow colour or a shade which can only be likened to cold tripe.
Tempers are not improved, either, by the sight of Kate Moss, that figure
of chosen famine, who in her Clingfilm attire has become the perverse,
rich icon of our days.
Today pernicious commercial pressures insist that there are just two
body images: too fat and too thin. The tabloids, so replete with
sensational morality tales about the overweight and the anorexic, are
now reaching a point where they deem Hollywood's sleeping habits less
juicy than its eating habits. This may have something to do with the
turn-off confessions of Hugh Grant and Heidi Fleiss but, the newsprint
crisis being what it is, promiscuity among celebs must today fight for
space against admissions of star-studded gluttony or starvation.
Out in the real world, however, the larger stuff of fashion is
improving as never before. In the past four years a significant number
of manufacturers has finally listened to what big women have been
telling them for generations: size need not limit style. There is no law
of nature which insists only the skinny have beauty on their side. Of
course, the neglect of this market never did make commercial sense, for
47% of British women are size 16 and over.
But it is easier to design for a nymphette than a heroic Venus: the
first can tolerate a designer's whimsical indulgence and just get away
with it; the second requires the true artistry of disciplined
imagination. Which is why the late Jean Muir's genius for controlled but
fluid line was such a godsend for generous bodies.
But the state of fashion is no longer a dictatorship, and those
designers who believed themselves famous enough to pick and choose their
customers can no longer afford to be contemptuous of full flesh. In
America entertainers like Roseanne have led the better-the-bigger
vanguard while over here Dawn French has not just humorously restored
self-esteem to fatties, she has teamed up with architect Helen Teague to
establish Sixteen47, a mail order and retail company of big, bold
clothes. Now in its fourth year Sixteen47 -- the title is a reference to
that UK body-size statistic -- is concerned not with mass-produced
cheapness but with pieces crafted from quality fabrics by accomplished
technicians.
In the intimate environment of their Primrose Hill shop in London, or
via the catalogue browsed through at the kitchen table, women are
encouraged automatically to think of themselves as elegant and
glamorous. ''Everyone wants to get dressed up once in a while'' says
French, and Teague reflects that the response has been extraordinary.
''There is a phenomenal demand for really up-to-date fashion in this
market.''
That said, their collection, like many of the best, works on the
principle that while a woman may keep an appraising eye on fashion, she
should be free to dress in a way that suits her and reflects her
personality. If she is a size 16 or over that shouldn't mean being
shunted into over-pretty smocks with disastrous pintucks on the bosom,
or the sort of full-sail kaftans which make her look like a land-locked
clipper.
Proof of the pining multitude out there is also seen in the good
business being done by labels like Jacques Verts Plus, and of other less
expensive manufacturers who have now pledged themselves to improving
fuller figure choice. Among them Elvi works on an ongoing co-ordination
principle so that key items from one season's collection have life into
the next. A similar philosophy applies at Richards which, in fact, aims
to have all cost-conscious fashion things for all women, its size ratio
stretching from 6 to 26.
At Ann Harvey, the chain now firmly established as a design-conscious
outsize leader, there are now 48 stores in Britain and expansion plans
for Germany. This autumn, however, the American company Liz Claibourne
will not offer Elisabeth its large label, on this side of the Atlantic.
The reason is simply because demand has exceeded franchise
accommodation, and Claibourne would prefer to wait and do business until
some roomier sites are found.
Like clothes of any sort, generous ones should be comfortable without
being smugly neat. For next season the familiar, casual line of easy
separates -- pleated pants, voluminous shirts, broad sweaters, blazers
and sarongs -- remains strong often picking up on the unexpected winter
pastels of the catwalk. But there is also a handsomely tailored
silhouette, often using puppy-dog check yet cunningly proportioned so as
not to look like something built at Yarrows.
However, no matter its cost, the satin petticoat dress should be
avoided -- that is unless the wearer has some weird obsession to appear
like a rogue blancmange.
But how did the way of all flesh come to be so fraught? Long before
fashion set the rules art idealised the female form, altering its
proportions to suit the taste of the time. And mostly it operated on the
generous side. Rubens, for instance, found weighty thighs delicious. So,
too, did Manet whose chubbily reclining nude in Dejeuner sur l'Herbe
seems to be gazing out of the picture, proclaiming:''Look, unbridled and
free this is how women are.'' And the response from the art market and
the bourgeoisie? Manet's masterpiece was howled down as scandalous.
In modern times, though, the liberty to show a leg in public has
somehow dictated that the chosen limb should be long and slender. Yet
nature in her wisdom stores fat in the buttocks and the thigh, tucking
it out of the way up there to provide us with something comfortable to
sit on as well as a standby for lean times. This is part and parcel of
our reserves for the intensive roles of childbearing and nursing, and
the body clings to it possessively. You might say, then, that soft,
round, voluptuous thighs are every woman's birthright. So, who's fault
is it if, instead of being positive about them, we gaze on fat thighs in
a mirror and brand them as something hateful?
Jacques Vert Plus is stocked by Frasers, Glasgow and Edinburgh, who
also stock the Italian larger fashion label, Marina Rinaldi, along with
Jenners, Edinburgh. The Sixteen47 catalogue is available on receipt of
#1 (cheque or postal order) to Sixteen47 Ltd, 69 Gloucester Avenue,
LONDON NW1 8LD. Ann Harvey is in Buchanan Street, Glasgow; Richards are
in Argyle Street, Glasgow; Elvi is at the Bon Accord shopping centre,
Aberdeen, Union Street, Glasgow and The Avenue, Newton Mearns.

A WEALTHY Scottish widow who died earlier this year has left her
entire estate of #600,000 to the Scottish Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals.
Mrs Agnes ''Nessie'' MacRae, of Burnbank, Durn Road, Portsoy, died in
April, aged 84, after spending the last two years of her life in a
nursing home in Turriff.
In her will, written 45 years ago, she left her entire estate to the
SSPCA, the highest single donation it has ever had.
Mrs MacRae was born in Portsoy in Banffshire, where her father ran the
local bakers, Milton's. Her husband, Ronald, from the Inverness area,
was an Army surgeon who rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel.
When he was posted to India with the Army Medical Corps during the
war, she followed him, making the six-week journey on a troop ship.
After the war, they remained in India, where Lieutenant Colonel MacRae
was with the Indian Medical Service.
When he retired more than 20 years ago they returned to Portsoy where
Mrs MacRae's hobby was her West Highland terriers.
Mr MacRae, a keen salmon fisherman, died three years ago. Two years
ago, with her sight failing, Mrs MacRae moved into Glenesk Nursing Home
in Turriff. ''She was very well liked because she was a character,''
said Mrs Emma Montgomery, the deputy matron.
''She was strong-willed, interesting, and intelligent but she
certainly didn't give any strong indication of her love of animals.
There is a dog in the home and if it came into the lounge she would take
notice of it but that was about it. However, it is great she has left
her money to such a cause.''
The SSPCA's head of fund raising, Ms Diana Allen, said: ''I'm
absolutely delighted that Mrs MacRae chose the SSPCA as the sole
beneficiary. By their very nature, legacies are erratic and the society
is in a very vulnerable position, having to depend on such an
unpredictable form of income which is so important.
''On top of this, we lose a lot of money to England when people
mistakenly refer to us as the RSPCA. Part of our education programme is
to let people know that it is the SSPCA which deals with animal welfare
matters in Scotland.''
The SSPCA receives no Government funds or National Lottery money and
legacies represent a significant proportion of its annual income to fund
the work of its 47 inspectors, 14 animal welfare centres, and five
education officers.
* A GOOD turn has brought a village Scout troop a #20,000 windfall.
Retired mill worker Miss Jean Forbes, 75, was one of several people in
the Speyside village of Aberlour who received a Christmas gift of
firewood from the Scouts.
The present was particularly welcome because Miss Forbes, who suffered
ill health for a long time, was not well off. However, three years ago
she was left thousands by her sister Priscilla.
Miss Forbes died early this year and she left #20,300 to the Scouts in
her will, which has just been published. The local Church of Scotland
church gets a similar amount.
Scout treasurer Robin McBain, who works in the Bank of Scotland, said:
''This money just came out of the blue. We are highly delighted. We own
our hall and will probably use the money to refurbish it and to buy some
new equipment.''

ANN COWAN checks out the latest wardrobes for some classical fridge
magnets.
THOSE who disapprove of classical music in TV commercials should hate
Michelangelo's David in the form of a fridge magnet. Worse still, David
is a dressing doll figure. Acting as Barbie to his Ken, is Venus, as in
La Naissance De Venus by William Bouguereau in the Musee D'Orsay.
Our hero and heroine come not from Florence or Paris, but from Round
The World, Victoria Street, and The Gyle, Edinburgh, and Schoolhill,
Aberdeen. They are as naked as art intended until their magnetic clothes
go on.
In one pack Venus comes with checked 1940s sundress, black leathers,
pink cardi and other items, including Doc Martens and a giant shell on
which to arise from the waves. On another card her clothes are tacky in
more ways than one with fishnet tights and leopardskin mini. We are
looking at the unmentionable, the seriously politically incorrect, but
the word has to be said -- its common. The satin lacy undies shimmer
between black and peacock blue.
No peacock himself, David dresses down. Taking the young Marlon Brando
as his role model it's on with all the trappings of moody, macho man.
There's the white vest, the black leather jacket and denim jeans. The
bothersome boots make the anti-fashion statement that they are prepared
to kick arse. In his other wardrobe David is the Ivy League college
jock, ready for athletics, baseball, boxing then to cool down swimming
and scuba diving.
During heatwaves Venus and David owners could copy Marilyn Monroe in
the Seven Year Itch. They could keep the spare pants inside the fridge.
It would be a kindness.

With hair now down to her waist, Clare Trodden reveals the pleasureand
pain of long flowing locks, and the effect they can have on others
THERE was one defiant crack -- from a creaky joint -- and he was on
his knees, among the miniscule clippings, hardly any more than
stubble-length really. And it was all because of me and my precious
locks.
It wasn't me who had reduced the stylist to submission though, it was
my sister, Bernie. She was then in a prenuptial stage and, fearing that
she might be accompanied down the aisle by a teenage Eraserhead, was
taking a proprietorial interest in ensuring my blonde wavy tresses
remaining intact.
Under her gimlet eye (and eventually without the aid of a spirit
level), no more than a quarter of an inch was ever removed at any one
session. I was impressed; this was power, and it was also the first time
I was consciously aware that long hair, even only just past
shoulder-length, was something out of the ordinary.
Since then I have had many lesser brushes with various salons. I've
let hairdressers pull it, tweak it, curl it, straighten it, trim it, put
it up and watch it tumble down again. Despite five to six inches being
lopped in one fell swoop, it's now waist-length.
Admittedly, I've done a lot worse to it myself than any hairdresser
has ever dared. It's been blue, pink, and green (mother's favourite).
It's been braided and beaded. I've anointed it with oil, bathed it in
beer, and rinsed it in vinegar (''Three bags of chips and two suppers,
hen.'' Ha, ha. No-one told me not to use a whole bottle of malt.) Once,
sleepily leaning over to pick up a dropped hymn-sheet, I even set it on
fire at an Easter Vigil. Mother was keeping watch but not in my
direction, and it was passkeepers who beat out the blaze.
There were hair-raising styles too. Not content with occasional
back-combing, my sister had just the job for the school dance -- and
went all creative with several packets of pipe-cleaners. Impatient
friends stood by while she, brothers and parents attempted to extract
said weapons. Finally, Crystal Tipps did go to the ball in an explosion
of spiralling curls.
Why have I persevered so long? I like my hair this length, it's grown
on me -- gradually. There's a lot I can do with it (even if I don't),
and there's nothing I can do with short hair -- I have rendered
unrecognisable the best short cuts with a well-intentioned hairdryer
under friends' valiant instructions. Occasionally I am tempted by a
Skinhead O'Connor approach, but not for long. There would be no hiding
place for a slightly scarred skull (caused by a car crash not an errant
Scissorhands), nor would I meet such interesting people.
Having long hair is like a magnet. Imperfect strangers feel free to
comment on it, even to touch it. There are those who pity me, amazed it
can be washed and dried in less than a week and that I can live a
''normal'' life -- ''You swim/run/live with that. I couldn't manage
it.'' Yes, we each have our cross to bear -- but having to shove a
tangle of hair into a mis-shapen swim-cap is hardly in the Mother Teresa
league.
There are always other women who, so they tell me, once had longer,
straighter, wavier, blonder, better-conditioned locks. Strange to say
many of them now have brown bobs or grown-out perms.
''Look at all those split ends . . . if that was me I'd have it all
cut off,'' charmed one shorn clubber. If I were you madam, I'd cut to
the chase and lose a few layers before donning Lycra.
But, so much for sticks and stones. It's the ones who like to paw who
really get on my nerves. Weddings are the best bet for this. But most
bars where men of a certain age cluster will do. ''Dawl, is it real?''
This from one who looked like a muppet with the stuffing knocked out of
him. He made the same mistake as a colleague who said that long hair
''means you are soft and available'' as, with one paw clutching a pint
of 80 shilling, and the other weaving through my hair, he proceeded to
serenade me. This stopped abruptly. The thing I chose to shake loose and
let fall was a sizeable glass ashtray. His shin was what it chose to
fall against.
Others have been stopped dead with a few sniffs and the confession
that I am completely bald. Only once did my confidant reveal that his
too was a wig. And set at such a jaunty angle too.
One guard held the train as I scurried towards the platform: ''It was
your hair I noticed,'' he said. So it does have its uses. People do
react differently depending on whether it is down (they tend to chat and
smile more) or scraped back in denial of its length (they keep well
back). This is probably in much the same way they do when you are
smartly dressed or scruffy -- you may be the same person but they've
already jumped to their own conclusion on your appearance.
The thing is, I don't mind people have lots of hair or having none.
The length of my hair means nothing other than I like it this length for
the time being. I would not cease to exist if it were all lopped off --
though it is quite disconcerting when a stranger actually says: ''I'd
love to chop all your hair off.''
So, you keep your hands off my hair and I'll promise to do the same
without a word of criticism of your shape, style or length of hair --
unless of course it's knee length . . . now that is seriously weird if
you're not six feet under.

* THERE'S only one thing worse than short hair that's badly cut and
out of condition and that's a longer version of same.
Rita Rusk admits that long hair doesn't have to be cut but emphasises
that fringing at the front and light layering can soften a long look.
For those who want to stick to one length, she suggests alternatives to
update it: ''Turn it out at the bottom rather than under -- it's much
more fashionable,'' she advises.
If you are looking for a change, shop around the salons. Go for a
consultation first and then think about what's on offer.
Stunning salon styles often end in tears at home. David Nicholson of
the Rainbow Room has a simple way of preventing this. ''I show clients
how to style their hair -- and then embarrass them into practising it
themselves before they leave.''
Here are some simple hints to keeping hair tip top.
* Choose shampoo and conditioner with care -- avoid harsh detergents
which strip the hair of its natural oils.
* Many shampoos can be used to more gentle effect by diluting with
pure water.
* Don't pile hair on top of the head when washing, you'll only tangle
and break it.
* Comb through conditioner with a wide-toothed comb.
* Deep-condition hair at least once a week.
* Take extra care to rinse out every trace of shampoo and conditioner
-- otherwise they'll leave your hair limp and attract dirt.
* Resist the temptation to run your fingers through your hair -- this
will stimulate the sebaceous glands, causing lanky and lacklustre locks.
* Have regular trims.
* Go easy on the hair drier, hot rollers and brushes.
* A regular pre-wash DIY head massage helps hair and releases tension.
* Make sure you have a few alternative styles at your fingertips.

LABOUR MP George Galloway has demanded action from Foreign Secretary
Malcolm Rifkind over claims that the four Western hostages being held by
an alleged terrorist group in Kashmir are victims of a ''dirty tricks''
plot involving the Indian Government.
The Glasgow Hillhead MP's call follows exclusive reports in The Herald
about growing suspicions among Western intelligence agencies that the
Al-Faran hostage-takers may be part of an Indian conspiracy to discredit
Kashmiri militant groups.
The two Britons, an American, and a German have been held captive for
nine weeks. A fifth hostage, a Norwegian, was found beheaded three weeks
ago.
In his latest report on Thursday, Herald Defence Correspondent Ian
Bruce revealed how Indian authorities have been obstructing a rescue
mission by the US Army's Delta Force -- the American equivalent of the
SAS -- impounding the US troops' weapons and equipment, telling them no
detailed maps of the relevant region exist, and confining them to a
military airbase.
An earlier report prompted Mr Galloway to demand that the Indian High
Commissioner be summoned to the Foreign Office to give ''an explanation
of the exact relationship between the Indian Government and the
so-called Al-Faran group''.
Now, in response to the second article, the MP has repeated his call
for the High Commissioner to be summoned, to provide answers to ''the
growing number of questions''.
In a letter to the Foreign Secretary, Mr Galloway said The Herald had,
for the second time within a week, given public vent to a feeling which
was growing in informed circles about the ''inherently improbable''
Al-Faran operation.
He told Mr Rifkind: ''As you know, this group are completely unknown
and have been utterly condemned by all other Kashmiri groups, and an
unprecedented general strike has been held in the occupied territories
against the kidnapping and murder.''
The operation came at a time when India had suffered diplomatic and
political reverses on its policy of intensifying its illegal occupation
of Kashmir, said Mr Galloway.
''Then, hey presto, the kidnapping and murder of the tourists. The
kidnappers speak no Kashmiri. There is no record of their existence.
They are able to maintain regular and apparently easy communication with
the Indian authorities, making calls, sending faxes, distributing
photographs, and making press releases, all from a wild mountain
redoubt, the whereabouts of which remain unknown to the Indian forces.
''Now, in Ian Bruce's second story, we read of physical obstruction of
potential rescuers and non co-operation.
''Those of us who know this conflict well and who know the Kashmiri
organisations inside out, are increasingly convinced that all is not
what it seems.''

THEY hadn't paid the pipers but a local council had no hesitation in
trying to curb the tune after complaints about practice sessions by a
visiting police pipe band.
In the end, it didn't come to a confrontation but the affair has left
the band's hosts, the directors of the Glynhill Hotel, reeling with the
feeling they have been pilloried unfairly by Renfrew District Council.
The Victoria Police pipe band, from Australia has come to Scotland for
the past seven years to take part in the World Pipe Band Championships.
It costs them #120,000 for the pleasure and, each year, they spend a
fortnight at the Glynhill Hotel in Paisley Road. As part of their
routine, they practise in the hotel car park for about an hour each day.
Hotel director Netta Stevenson said: ''Our other guests thought it was
a free cabaret.''
A council inspector, citing two anonymous phone calls, saw it in a
different light.
The Glynhill duly received a letter from the director of environmental
services, saying complaints had been made about the noise and one
householder ''has been advised to complain to Strathclyde Police for
action to be taken''.
The letter added: ''On checking our departmental records, it would
appear that this complaint of pipe band music is not an isolated
incident but has been in fact occuring over several years when pipe
bands reside at your hotel.''
Glynhill executive director Miss Maroulla Nicholas said they regretted
any disturbance: ''However, we really do our best to accommodate and
consider them and have done voluntarily at considerable expense over the
past 25 years.
''I feel that we are being pilloried somewhat and certainly threatened
by 'Strathclyde Police taking action' against us.
''We genuinely believe that people not involved in tourism haven't a
clue about the effort and expense required to bring visitors into a
particular area.
''Should we condescendingly allow them to come and admire the scenery,
buy whisky and cashmere, but above all keep quiet?''
Had Strathclyde Police been called, she shuddered to think what kind
of farce they would have been involved in. One of the ironies was that
the Victoria band were in competition with the Strathclyde Police pipe
band in Grade One of the championship at Scotstoun.
Last night, a council spokesman said: ''We are trying to be as
sympathetic as possible but when we get a complaint we have to
investigate it.
''The council planning convener has written to the hotel management to
suggest a meeting be set up to try to avoid a problem in the future.''

CUMBERNAULD and Kilsyth District Council has made a bid to purchase
all 4000 houses currently owned and rented by Cumbernauld New Town
Development Corporation.
The bid, which is confidential, comes prior to the development
corporation being wound up at the end of next year.
Cumbernauld Development Corporation will assess all the bids received
and draw up a shortlist of up to two landlords for each of five disposal
areas. By the end of the year, it will recommend to the Secretary of
State which landlords should appear on the tenants' ballot papers next
March.
The district council's Labour leader, Ms Catherine Craigie, said
yesterday she was confident that, after taking independent advice, the
tenants would vote for the council as the successor landlord, to ensure
their homes were managed and maintained properly.

THE arts in Scotland will benefit by sharing #2m from the National
Lottery -- almost half of which will go to the University of Glasgow,
providing a new centre for its department of theatre, film, and
television studies.
It will include a 200-seat theatre and a 150-seat cinema, both of
which will be open to the public.
Yesterday's announcement came just 24 hours after The Herald revealed
exclusively that Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth plans to approach
the Chancellor in an effort to gain tax breaks for the Scottish Film
Industry, to encourage Scottish film makers.
The grant to the university of #900,000 is the largest in the latest
tranche allocated to Scotland, and was welcomed by officials who said it
would be an enormous boost for local film makers, video artists, and
community groups working in dedicated premises.
Following the announcement by the Scottish Arts Council yesterday,
Professor Jan McDonald, of the university's department of theatre, film,
and television studies, said: ''This is good news both for the
university and the local community.
''This will not only provide us with first-rate facilities for the
study of theatre, film, and television, but it will be a tremendous
resource for the city.''
The university is currently looking at ways of making its resources
available to the public and the creation of a new theatre opens up the
possibility of staging mini festivals and entertaining visiting theatre
companies.
News of the grant completes recent fund-raising efforts, in which
#50,000 was awarded by the Bank of Scotland, and #25,000 from the TSB
Foundation Scotland, with almost half the seats in the theatre purchased
at #300 each by supporters of the scheme.
The centre will be located in Gilmorehill Halls, a B-listed church
close to Glasgow University Union, with work expected to start later
this year.
Its present centre already has a 5A rating for the quality of its
research, the highest rating any university can obtain, and attracts 25
applications for every undergraduate place.
Arts Council Lottery Committee chairman, Mr Douglas Connell, said the
latest grants would improve significantly the provision for arts
throughout Scotland.
In Edinburgh, officials of the Scottish Poetry Library were equally
delighted -- it receives #506,000 for new premises in the Holyrood area.
Director Tessa Ransford said: ''We hope work will start next year, as
part of the revitalisation of the Canongate.''
Others receiving lottery funds include:
Cumbernauld Theatre Trust -- #176,400 towards a major theatre
renovation; Glasgow Museums -- #178,000 towards display equipment and
furniture in the Gallery of Modern Art; theatre performers Clamjafrie --
#48,600 for video equipment; Perthshire Brass Association -- #39,787 for
new instruments and a towing trailer.
Video Access Centre -- #38,587 for film and video production work in
Edinburgh and the Lothians; Artlink, which co-ordinates arts projects in
Lothian area hospitals -- #29,510 to create new galleries at St John's
Hospital, Livingston, and the Royal Edinburgh Hospital.
Touring theatre company Baldy Bane, which performs for schoolchildren
and community groups -- #24,787 for equipment; Killin Dramatic Club --
#15,505 to replace technical equipment; The Aboyne and Deeside Festival
-- #14,700 for a concert grand piano for its Deeside Theatre.
The Scottish Book Publishers' Association -- #8500 for a computerised
ordering service; Dundee College -- #6500 for a building conversion to
create a drama and dance facility; Shetland Folk Festival Society --
#5000 towards computer equipment for administration purposes.

BRIAN Barnes's fledgling career as a senior professional was on hold
yesterday, if not actually in jeopardy, after he had been diagnosed as
having developed a blood clot in a main artery.
He immediately withdrew from the Shell Scottish Seniors Championship
and must now delay indefinitely his return from Europe to the equivalent
US Tour.
Speaking from St John's Hospital, Aberdeen, where he was taken for
treatment after the condition had been identified by a scan at another
hospital in the city, Barnes, 50 in June, said despondently:
''Everything was going the right way. I was looking forward to doing the
double of the British and Scottish titles, and now I'm stuck in bed.''
Immediately after Barnes had won the British Championship at Royal
Portrush, he had an operation for thrombophlebitis in the right leg.
Only a fortnight later, he returned to action, finishing second at
Collingtree last weekend.
After having flown from London, however, his right leg became severely
swollen and he was prescribed a blood-thinning medicine.
Barnes played a practice round on Wednesday and was in fine fettle
after Thursday's pro-am, in which he birded two of the last three holes.
However, in the early hours of yesterday morning, he awoke with severe
pain behind his right knee. He telephoned his doctor at home and he
arranged for Barnes to be examined by a local specialist.
Barnes, ordered not to move for three days, was put on a drip to thin
the blood. Tests will continue and yesterday the forecast was that he
could be in hospital for a week, or until the condition is stabilised.
He hopes then to be able to return by helicopter to a hospital hear his
Sussex home.

A DUNDEE student, who used a university computer to publish plans for
bombs similar to the one used in the Oklahoma City outrage, will be
allowed to continue his studies, a faculty disciplinary committee
announced yesterday.
Three weeks ago, The Herald revealed how Mr Allan John Paterson, a
science undergraduate, had put recipes for fertiliser-based bombs on to
Dundee University's official Internet site, accessible by computer users
around the world.
His unauthorised entries went undetected for weeks and may have been
viewed by hundreds of electronic visitors to the university.
A committee which included vice-principal David Swinfen and director
of information technology, Mr Richard Murphy, interviewed Paterson twice
about the additional pages, which have now been removed.
A spokeswoman said Mr Paterson had been disciplined by the committee
and would not be expelled but refused to give further details. She said
the information Mr Paterson published was already available on many
unofficial Internet sites.
As a result, the university will review students' Internet access
privileges, thought to be the first such appraisal to be conducted in
Scotland.
Many science students rely on the Internet to keep abreast of
research. The electronic mail facility has all but replaced paper
communication in many departments.

THE number of health service managers has continued rising despite
promised Government cuts to red tape, new figures revealed yesterday.
The news comes as 16 nursing jobs are to be lost at a Highland
geriatric hospital, which will be cut to less than half its original
size.
Managers at the Highland Communities NHS Trust yesterday said it was
closing a ward at the County Hospital in Invergordon. Another two wards
have been shut in the last three years.
The Department of Health statistics found a 15% rise in the number of
senior and general managers, from 20,010 to 22,950, between 1993 and
1994.
Over the same period, the number of nurses and midwives has fallen by
4% to around 348,000.
However, health officials claimed part of the rise was down to the way
the numbers of managers were now counted. They were using a new system
to classify staff.
Yesterday's figures include previously published statistics showing
the number of managers has increased by 400% between 1989 and 1994.
Officials blamed the latest rise in senior managers on a
re-classification, which broadens the category to include lower tiers of
management.
Health reforms, which have been widely blamed for the burgeoning
bureaucracy, account for around 5% of the increase, they added.
The number of qualified nurses, excluding agency nurses, fell by more
than 11% from 393,740 to 348,690 between 1989 and 1994.
Highland Communities chief executive St John Hattersley claimed the
Invergordon cuts had no connection with the trust's #1.8m ''hole'' in
its budget which was discovered recently.
He said: ''The beds in ward three are not needed because our patients
are spending about half the time they used to in hospital before being
returned to the community.''
Earlier this summer, the trust's finance director, Mr Alasdair
Christie, was suspended and later sacked for harrassing two female
employees.
While he was away from his office, auditors discovered that #1m due
from the Highland Health Board had not been claimed in time.
A further inquiry revealed a further #800,000 shortfall in the budget
and a cost-cutting programme is now under way.
Ms Lucy MacKenzie of Age Concern said the organisation was very
worried about moves to reduce the number of long- stay beds for the
elderly.
Meanwhile, hopes of a breakthrough in the long-running NHS pay dispute
were jolted last night when Royal College of Nursing officials said they
were unlikely to attend peace talks due to be resumed on Monday at the
invitation of human resources director Ken Jarrold.
All other NHS unions and associations have accepted the invitation and
anticipate new proposals from management aimed at heading off industrial
action being threatened by an increasing number of the 900,000 NHS
staff.
RCN leaders fear that NHS managers will propose a three-year
compromise package encompassing locally negotiated increases to be
followed by agreement on national fall-back minimum rates.
They believe this could undermine the nurses and midwives' pay review
body and do little for the RCN cause in the present dispute where they
claim to be very near to achieving the ''critical mass'' of 300 ''no
strings'' pay offers to nurses which they have long claimed would
represent a de facto 3% national agreement.

COUNCILLORS did a U-turn yesterday and agreed to complete the #100,000
funding package for a rowing club's new boathouse.
Twice before Glasgow Rowing Club was refused help because the city
council had its own blueprint for a similar complex on the Clyde.
Indeed, park director Bernard Connolly told councillors as recently as
last May that the city's own project was supported by the Scottish
Sports Council.
However, it seems that the SSC was also supporting the rowing club.
Members of a finance sub-committee sat embarrassed yesterday when they
learned that the club, with SSC backing, had qualified for half its
required funding from the National Lottery.
Another 25% of the costs were in the bank, raised by the club's own
development fund. It now required only #24,625 from the council to
complete the funding.
Labour councillor Bob Gray reminded the committee that last May he had
supported the application. The situation facing the council had not
changed. He moved that the grant be approved.
Rowing club chairman Ronnie Goldie was in the public seats. He said
later: ''This is a dream we have been pursuing since 1977.''
All the plans were ready, he said, and building work will start
immediately opposite Glasgow Green.

SCOTLAND accounts for #3500m, or nearly 5%, of the #75bn amassed by
Britain's richest 500, writes CAMERON SIMPSON.
The country's wealthiest resident is Mr Bruno Schroder, according to
BusinessAge magazine. Mr Schroder, who lives in Strathclyde, holds a 43%
stake in Schroders, Britain's largest merchant bank. He is ranked 18th
richest in Britain, down from sixth last year.
The richest man in the Borders is the Duke of Buccleuch and
Queensberry, whose personal worth is estimated at #400m. Tayside's
richest individual is said to be the Earl of Cadogan, whose #215m comes
from more than 90 acres of estates in London.
In Grampian, the wealthiest person is Blanche Buchan at #162m. She
inherited property in London from her father, Lord Howard de Walden, and
married Scottish landowner Captain Sinclair Buchan.
The fifth wealthiest person in the region is Mr John Ray, the owner of
Aberdeen oil service firm Rigblast, who has #50m. Hard on his heels with
#48m comes Mr Douglas Craig, MD of George Craig Group.
The richest person in the Highlands is Mr Edmund Vestey with #155m.
His money comes from United International, the huge meat empire founded
by his family. Mr Frederick Johnston, the richest person in Lothian with
#110m, is a new entry in the 500. His money comes from the Scottish
newspaper group of which he is chairman.
Joint third top in the region are Ian and Lenny McGeoch with #55m
each. The brothers built up Paisley-based clothing chain Mackays Stores.

THE Queen is Britain's richest person -- with a #2200m fortune,
according to a new survey published in BusinessAge magazine.
However, she would have trouble spending more than a fraction of her
wealth as the figure includes Buckingham Palace, the Scilly Isles, her
jewellery collection, and much of the royal art collection.
The Queen's ranking in the magazine's Rich 500 list of the wealthiest
people in Britain is a dramatic rise on the 72nd place she was awarded
last year, because of a re-evaluation of what the monarchy owns.
However, Buckingham Palace last night dismissed as ''ridiculous'' the
#2200m assessment of the Queen's wealth.
The report admits that most of the Queen's apparent wealth cannot be
sold or even given away.
However, the magazine states: ''Despite pleas of poverty from the
palace, the Queen owns title to all the royal residences and a
substantial part of the royal art collection,''
''In previous years, the palace has seen fit to throw a smokescreen
around the Queen's true wealth, largely because of the political
sensitivity of the issue.''
The fortune breaks down into:
* Personal private wealth, including investments and racehorses:
#160m.
* One tenth of the royal art treasures, including the world's finest
collection of Sevres porcelain: #1000m.
* The Queen's personal jewels -- excluding the Crown Jewels --
including gifts from admirers as varied as the South African de Beers
diamond magnates and the Emir of Qatar: #350m.
* Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle, and other royal residences, and
the Isles of Scilly: #700m.
BusinessAge editor Peter Kirwan said everything on the list was the
monarch's personal property but most of it was inalienable by law or
custom -- she owned it but could not sell it.
Mr Kirwan said research showed the Queen owned three times more land
than Queen Victoria -- 101,727 acres, worth more than #200m.
He said that, until recently, the monarchy had not paid tax for
several decades. ''In the meantime, what it's been doing with its money
is buying up large tracts of land around the country.''
The re-evaluation of the Queen's fortune pushes supermarket tycoon
David Sainsbury into second place with #1600m. Last year's number one
pornography and property billionaire, Mr Paul Raymond, is third with
#1550m.
Scotland could lay claim to ex-Beatle Paul McCartney, who at #525m, is
the 25th richest person. McCartney flits between his home in Kent and
his farm in the Mull of Kintyre.
It has been a good year for the rich. Excluding the Queen, the richest
Britons have seen their wealth increase by an average 12% since last
year's survey.
Big winners include Mr Joseph Bamford, up from #62m to #400m on the
strength of bumper profits at digger manufacturer JCB. Former Barings
chairman Lord Ashburton is down from #152m to #100m following the bank's
collapse.
To rub shoulders with John Cleese, Lord Archer, Sir Cliff Richard, and
David Hockney at the bottom of the 500 takes a mere #40m.
The list includes, for the first time, foreigners resident in Britain,
and the top 10 are:
1 The Queen, #2200m; 2 David Sainsbury, #1600m -- supermarket
chairman; 3 Paul Raymond, #1550m -- pornography and property tycoon; 4
Duke of Westminster, #1500m -- Britain's third biggest landowner; 5 John
Paul Getty II, #1450m -- American oil heir; 6 Sir Evelyn Rothschild,
#1250m -- banker; 7 George Livanos, #1200m -- shipping magnate and
financier; 8 Sir James Goldsmith, #1150m -- business entrepreneur; 9
Charles Feeney, #1100m -- Irish-American duty-free entrepreneur; 10 Sam
Cummings, #1100m -- arms dealer.
Last night, a palace spokeswoman said: ''What they are saying is
ridiculous. Unlike other people in this list, the Queen cannot sell most
of what they say she owns.
''The primary right of ownership is the right to sell as you wish. The
Queen can no more sell Buckingham Palace, for instance, than President
Clinton can sell the White House.''
A suggestion in the magazine that royal advisers were discussing with
the Government a plan for the Queen to buy back the Crown Estate, the
biggest single land portfolio in the country, generating a profit of
#84m in the past year, was ''simply undiluted speculative nonsense'',
she added.

A LIVINGSTON man was ordered to be detained in a mental hospital
yesterday after he admitted three charges of lewd and libidinous
behaviour towards young girls.
Linlithgow Sheriff Court was warned that hearing impaired Gary Duff,
21, felt he had done nothing wrong and could strike again at any time.
Duff, who refused to get voluntary counselling for his psychiatric
problems, asked the court to let him go to college on a child-care
course rather than go to hospital.
Sheriff Hector MacLean said: ''I simply don't have any option. He must
go into secure accommodation.''
He ordered Duff to be placed in the Royal Edinburgh psychiatric
hospital for 12 weeks for assessment. He will be held in Saughton Prison
until a hospital bed is available.
Duff, who lived alone in Deans South, visited children's play areas in
the town to watch young girls play.
Last summer, he approached three girls, aged six, seven, and nine. One
of them he lifted over a fence from her own garden.
His solicitor Jim Kelly warned at an earlier hearing: ''He does not
appreciate that his behaviour towards these children was wrong.''
Duff will be brought back to court on November 24 for sentence after
the psychiatrists have decided if he is treatable.

Trade spokesman Brian Wilson said the Government decision not to refer
planned takeovers of regional electricity companies to the Monopolies

of utilities.
He said that foreign companies would be attracted by the prospect of
returns they would not be allowed at home and would undoubtedly seek to
export much of this surplus.

A DIVER who went missing for 10 hours before being found alive was
dragged away from his companions by a conger eel, police revealed
yesterday.
Mr Cameron Bell, 32, was found semi-conscious and exhausted on the
shore of Loch Long on Thursday morning as emergency services were
beginning to fear he had drowned. He was taken by ambulance under police
escort to a decompression chamber at the Royal Navy submarine base at
nearby Faslane.
The diving instructor and three companions had been doing a late-night
dive off Ardgarten Point, near Arrochar, Dunbartonshire, when he went
missing. The others saw his torch go out and come back on again, but
found it was shining on the bed of the loch and there was no sign of Mr
Bell.
Yesterday, as the diver recovered at home, police told how a conger
eel, entangled in a length of fishing line, had been disturbed by the
light of his torch. The giant eel had darted out at the diver, who was
caught in the line and dragged backwards at high speed, deeper under the
water.
Chief Inspector Mike Deans, based at Helensburgh police station, said
a statement had been taken from Mr Bell shortly after he came around in
the decompression chamber.
He said: ''Mr Bell said it was a 6ft conger eel, which had a massive
fishing line attached to it. It came out from behind some rocks and the
line caught him around the head and he was dragged away at very high
speed. He managed to cut himself free and broke to the surface. He was
disorientated and cannot remember anything after that.''
As reported in The Herald yesterday, Mr Bell still had his knife in
his hand when he was discovered on a lochside road by a passing cyclist
on Thursday morning. A police underwater team, inshore lifeboat,
Ministry of Defence police launches, a Royal Navy rescue helicopter, and
coastguard auxiliaries had all spent hours searching for the diver.
After being treated by doctors at Faslane, Mr Bell was transferred to
the Vale of Leven Hospital at Alexandria for overnight observation.
Yesterday morning, he returned to Faslane for further examination by
doctors there before being discharged. A spokesman at the base said it
was possible that Mr Bell would return there in a month for a check-up.
After leaving Faslane, Mr Bell returned to his home in Moray Place,
Strathbungo, Glasgow, but declined to talk to reporters about his
ordeal.

A PRIVATE company has pulled out of its painting contract for the
Forth Bridge, three days before it was due to commence work.
The withdrawal of Dyce-based G and H McGill is a severe embarrassment
for Railtrack, which confirmed the deal in a blaze of publicity only
last week.
It also has ramifications for railway privatisation, because private
contractors may now think twice before bidding for work currently
carried out by BR staff.
McGill withdrew because of an impasse over accepting the transfer of a
dozen BR maintenance staff on current wages and conditions, according to
sources.
It is understood the company's original tender was on the basis that
TUPE -- the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment)
regulations -- would apply to just two workers within BR's
Infrastructure Maintenance Unit (IMU).
However, the Scottish IMU held fast, insisting McGill was obliged to
inherit the employment contracts of all BR transfers and not just the
two responsible for providing boat safety coverage during bridge work.
The deadlock was broken only when McGill pulled out, possibly as a
matter of principle or because the original tender was no longer
profitable with job transfers on existing pay terms.
However, the controversy is far from over. It would appear that
private firms -- including McGill -- may try to circumvent TUPE when
bidding for bridge work next time around and, from the outset, could
exclude suggestions of taking on BR staff, who would face redundancy
instead of transfer.
Railtrack announced last week that the rate of painting would more
than double in 1995-96, under the McGill contract, which cheered
campaigners who had protested about the bridge's rusting appearance.
Yesterday, Railtrack stood by its commitment to increase the rate of
painting although, from Monday, the programme will be on a ''day-to-day
basis'' pending a new invitation to bid for the work. That invitation is
unlikely to be issued until after the New Year.
Railtrack's statement, headed Forth Road Briefing, seemed to border on
the farcical because its own question-and-answer agenda was set.
However, it also contained the warning: ''Wait and see the outcome of
the next competitive tender.''
The statement also implied that any confusion over TUPE might not
arise in future, by declaring: ''The advantages of entering into
detailed discussions with potential contractors, such as McGill, which
has extensive experience painting North Sea oil rigs, is that one
sometimes identifies even better systems.
''It is relatively common in commercial procurement to take the
opportunity to abort one competitive tender and redefine
specifications.''
While ''disappointed'' with McGill's withdrawal, it said the firm
would be asked to participate when the next tender was sought ''in the
early months of 1996''.
Mr Dick King, Scottish secretary of the Transport Salaried Staffs'
Association, said McGill's withdrawal was ''a strategic retreat prompted
by the realisation of hitherto unforeseen costs''.
He added: ''I have no doubt that the additional costs which McGill
would have to bear, in meeting perceived obligations under TUPE on
taking on an extra 12 employees -- not envisaged when it tendered --
have played the major, if not sole, part in persuading it to withdraw
gracefully.''
Mr King said the lesson was of ''immense importance'' to Government
plans to place railway work in the private sector: ''Any prospective
contractors will now realise there could well be considerable unseen
costs associated with TUPE obligations.
''Contractors will not wish to seek pig-in-a-poke contracts of this
nature and thus Government ambitions are likely to be thwarted.
Mr Tony Smith, director of IMU Scotland, said he was delighted that
the 12 staff jobs had been secured by McGill's withdrawal.
Labour's Scottish transport spokesman Henry McLeish was also delighted
and declared: ''It opens the way for other contracts to be challenged
because TUPE obligations have not been met.''
He saw no reason why BR staff, who have painted the bridge for more
than a century, should be sacrificed. ''It is good news that the
maintenance of this vital asset, and object of national pride, should
remain in public control,'' he said.
McGill failed to respond to inquiries from The Herald.

<HEADLINE>25 drug arrests as Eagle swoops. Operation Eagle makes first swoop.</HEADLINE>

A TOTAL of 25 people had been arrested by early this morning as the
enforcement phase of Operation Eagle, the Strathclyde Police anti-drugs
initiative, began yesterday.
Police officers throughout the region were involved in operations to
target those involved in dealing in drugs.
A police spokesman said there had been arrests for various alleged
offences under the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1971.
Quantities of the controlled drugs heroin, Temazepam, temgesic,
ecstacy and cannabis had been recovered on the first day of the
operation which will continue until Hogmanay.
Five people were detained this morning after a police drugs raid on a
packed Airdrie disco.
They were detained under the Criminal Justice Scotland Act suspected
of having committed contraventions of the Misuse of Drugs Act. The five
were taken to Coatbridge police station for further inquiries.
The raid on The Worx Club in Buchanan Street took place around 1am and
involved 60 police officers from all sections of the force.
The dramatic events unfolded as the words ''Operation Bride, strike
now, strike now, strike now,'' were shouted by one of the officers
leading the inquiry.
A fleet of police vans raced from a pre-determined rendezvous point to
the club some half-a-mile away. They joined undercover officers at the
scene.
A secret briefing before the raid revealed that police were targeting
a number of suspected drug dealers. A team of officers in stab proof
vests quickly entered the club and headed for the area where the
suspects were thought to be.
One by one the suspects were taken out handcuffed to officers. The
manager, Mr Kenneth Mitchell, demanded to police that he be allowed to
speak to the press. He said: ''There are two sides to every story. We
are co-operating with the police in this area and had a steward at the
police station to get all the literature on this operation. This is
nonsense. Really nice people are having their evening ruined.''
Police said the inquiry had been a success after weeks of hard work.
The officer leading the inquiry, Detective Inspector David Johnston,
said it was the first time an operation of that magnitude had taken
place in N Division.
He said: ''The launch of Operation Eagle will hopefully get the
message home to people and let them see what we are all about. This is
not a common operation but it has been done in the past and will be done
again. It serves as a warning both to owners and licencees of these
types of premises and also to the general public.''
Earlier, Scottish Office Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton promised
tough action against drug dealers after meeting parents whose children
have died in Glasgow from drug abuse.
However, he stopped short of promising a full public inquiry into the
alarming growth in the number of young people who are dying in the city
from drugs. He said he and his officials would look into the matter
before taking a final decision.
The parents, members of the Glasgow Association of Family Support
Groups met the Minister of State with Glasgow Central MP Mike Watson who
has campaigned for three years to have the high number of deaths
investigated.
He said more than 70 youngsters had died this year in Glasgow in
drug-related deaths, and even that high figure is believed to be below
the real number because of under-reporting.
Glasgow has particular problems, the MP said, because of the high
incidence of injecting drugs, and also because more drug users in
Glasgow use a variety of drugs than in any other European city. He wants
an inquiry in order to discover why this is the case and how much this
lethal drug cocktail is taking lives.
The parents were also seeking a ban on the drug Temazepam which is
widely abused in the city and for tighter controls on the prescribing of
the heroin-substitue methadone. Some city chemists are simply giving
registered addicts phials of methadone, which can then be sold on the
illegal drugs market, rather than ensuring the methadone syrup is
consumed by the addict.
Mr Watson said after the meeting: ''Sadly we are going to be over the
hundred mark for drug deaths in the city this year for the first time
ever. Only a full inquiry will bring the real issues out into the
open.''
He added that the meeting with the Minister was a worthwhile exercise,
and that he awaited with interest his response to the call for an
inquiry.
Lord James expressed sympathy to the parents for the loss of their
loved ones to drugs, and emphasised the Government's determination to
meet the challenge of drug misuse with vigour.
The Scottish Office view is that while the Government is determined to
deal severely with drug dealers and traffickers it is equally concerned
to ensure that treatment and support services are available for those
who fall victim to their evil trade.
Said Lord James afterwards: ''It is vitally important that we bring
the full weight of the law to bear on drug dealers and traffickers and
ensure that they are dealt with severely.''
He continued: ''The general public have a role to play in reporting
them to the police and helping remove them from the streets. The tragic
loss of young life which I heard about today firsthand from parents who
have lost sons through drugs emphasises to me the need for tough action.
''We must also continue to strive, through prevention and education
efforts, to keep our young people out of the grip of the pushers.

A JUDGE was criticised last night after telling an 18-year-old that he
was a ''pretty boy'' and risked being sexually assaulted while serving
his sentence.
Judge Alan Simpson made his comments while sentencing Jamie Dale to
two years' prison for a vicious attack on his flatmate.
As he committed Dale to the Feltham young offenders institution in
west London, Judge Simpson said at London's Snaresbrook Crown Court:
''The trouble with Feltham -- the problem with a teenager like Dale --
is that he is a pretty boy and he is liable to assaults of more than one
kind.''
Turning to blond-haired Dale, he said: ''It will be difficult for
someone like you in custody with young men.''
Dale had been bitten by a fellow prisoner while on remand in custody,
the court was told.
Director of the Howard League for Penal Reform, Ms Frances Cook, said
the judge's comments were ''highly irresponsible''.
''To send a young man back to a young offenders institution with a
warning that he faces being sexually assaulted is quite irresponsible,''
Ms Cook said.
''The first few weeks of a sentence are the worst for any youngster
and for a young man to have these remarks hanging over him is very
worrying indeed.''
Dale's sentence follows a three-day trial last month when the court
heard he flew into a rage during a row with his flatmate.
Mr Ian Anthony accused him of listening in on a private telephone
conversation and ordered him to put the receiver down.
Dale grabbed a knife and thrust it into Mr Anthony's bedroom door
twice, before kicking it off its hinges at their shared address in
Clementina Road, Leyton, east London.
Dale then lunged at his victim's stomach with the knife.
Mr Anthony attempted to calm his flatmate but when he tried to grab
the blade, it sliced through his thumb, partially severing it.
He needed 30 stitches after the attack.
Dale, now of Savernake Road, Chelmsford, Essex, was convicted of
causing grievous bodily harm with intent.
He had denied the attack, on January 9 this year, claiming he had
acted in self defence after the victim attacked him with a baseball bat.
Judge Simpson: ''After a row with Mr Anthony, who is older and
substantially bigger than you, you went to your room and came back with
two knives and attacked your victim with one of them, almost severing
his thumb.
''You have been found guilty of one of the most serious charges in the
book. This is a serious offence, and custody is inevitable.''
Mr Peter Tatchell of OutRage, the organisation for lesbians and gays,
described the judge's comments as ''scandalous''.
''He seems to have given this man a double sentence -- not only a term
of imprisonment but one in which he faces the prospect of sexual
assault,'' Mr Tatchell said.

RANGERS and Scotland goalkeeper Andy Gorman was given the go-ahead
yesterday to sell one of his two houses -- a home worth #242,000.
A judge lifted a legal restriction which blocked the sale of the house
in Midlothian after the goalkeeper agreed to lodge #5900 in court.
The restriction was in the form of an inhibition by Ian McDonald
Preservation, of Lasswade Road, Edinburgh, which is suing Mr Goram in
Edinburgh Sheriff Court for #5875.
This is for work carried out at the #242,000 house at Pentland Grove
House, Roslin, Midlothian, which Mr Goram is now in the process of
selling.
He has lodged a counter claim for more than #9000, claiming that the
work was not done properly.
As security for its claim, McDonald Preservation obtained an
inhibition which blocked the sale of the Roslin property and a second
home Mr Goram owns in Penicuik.
Yesterday at the Court of Session, Mr Keith Stewart, counsel for the
goalkeeper, asked Lord Macfadyen to lift the inhibition which prevented
Pentland Grove House from being sold.
He explained that yesterday was the settlement date for the sale of
the house and it was important for Mr Goram that the inhibition was
lifted.
McDonald Preservation was willing to agree to that on condition that
Mr Goram lodged #5900 in court as security for the action in the sheriff
court.
Lord Macfadyen agreed to lift the restriction on the sale of Pentland
Grove House and awarded the expenses of yesterday's hearing to McDonald
Preservation.
The block on the sale of the Penicuik house remains in force.

A CAMPAIGN to highlight the plight of the one in 10 Scottish children
who suffer sexual, physical, and emotional abuse was launched in Glasgow
yesterday by Princess Margaret.
Relaunched as Children 1st, the Royal Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Children said it hoped, with the help of hard-hitting posters
and billboards, to adopt a more campaigning role aimed at preventing
abuse.
Chief executive Arthur Wood said, for the last 100 years, the charity
had concentrated its efforts in the field of child protection but had
decided the time had come for a shift of emphasis.
The society, which found itself in financial difficulties three years
ago, hopes to double its income over the next two years to #4m and
expand its support services.
As president of the society, the princess attended the organisation's
annual meeting in Glasgow's City Chambers. Accompanied by the city's
Lord Provost Tommy Dingwall, she released 13,000 balloons in George
Square, each representing an abused child.
At the meeting, Cardinal Thomas Winning outlined the grim reality of
poverty in Strathclyde and its effects on the family. He said recent
reports revealed that, in nearly 40 primary schools in Strathclyde, nine
out of 10 children were eligible for shoe and clothing allowances. He
also outlined the effects of what he called spiritual poverty and the
disintegration of family life.
He praised the charity's change of direction, and said: ''Your task, I
believe, would be made easier if society was prepared to address with
determination the issues confronting too many families.''

CLEANER Jimmy Graham prepares a memorial to one of Scotland's
bloodiest massacres for its unveiling today, nearly 200 years after the
event.
Twelve people were killed and up to 20 more injured by regular cavalry
units during the Tranent Militia Riot of August 1797.
To commemorate the event, East Lothian District councillor Tom
Ferguson will unveil the specially commissioned bronze statue as a
lasting memorial to the dead.
It depicts local woman Jackie Crookston, who reputedly led an
uproarious mob through the town prior to the riot, beating her drum and
calling on her fellow villagers to stand up for their rights.
The 10ft-high statue will stand in Tranent's Civic Square, close to
the town's High Street, where the riot took place.

<HEADLINE>New blow for Railtrack as firm ditches Forth Bridge contract</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>IAIN WILSON CHIEF REPORTER</BYLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>976584967</RECORDNO>

A PRIVATE company has pulled out of its painting contract for the
Forth Bridge, three days before it was due to commence work.
The withdrawal of Dyce-based G and H McGill is a severe embarrassment
for Railtrack, which confirmed the deal in a blaze of publicity only
last week.
It also has ramifications for railway privatisation, because private
contractors may now think twice before bidding for work currently
carried out by BR staff.
McGill withdrew because of an impasse over accepting the transfer of a
dozen BR maintenance staff on current wages and conditions, according to
sources.
It is understood the company's original tender was on the basis that
TUPE -- the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment)
regulations -- would apply to just two workers within BR's
Infrastructure Maintenance Unit (IMU).
However, the Scottish IMU held fast, insisting McGill was obliged to
inherit the employment contracts of all BR transfers and not just the
two responsible for providing boat safety coverage during bridge work.
The deadlock was broken only when McGill pulled out, possibly as a
matter of principle or because the original tender was no longer
profitable with job transfers on existing pay terms.
However, the controversy is far from over. It would appear that
private firms -- including McGill -- may try to circumvent TUPE when
bidding for bridge work next time around and, from the outset, could
exclude suggestions of taking on BR staff, who would face redundancy
instead of transfer.
Railtrack announced last week that the rate of painting would more
than double in 1995-96, under the McGill contract, which cheered
campaigners who had protested about the bridge's rusting appearance.
Yesterday, Railtrack stood by its commitment to increase the rate of
painting although, from Monday, the programme will be on a ''day-to-day
basis'' pending a new invitation to bid for the work. That invitation is
unlikely to be issued until after the New Year.
Railtrack's statement, headed Forth Road Briefing, seemed to border on
the farcical because its own question-and-answer agenda was set.
However, it also contained the warning: ''Wait and see the outcome of
the next competitive tender.''
The statement also implied that any confusion over TUPE might not
arise in future, by declaring: ''The advantages of entering into
detailed discussions with potential contractors, such as McGill, which
has extensive experience painting North Sea oil rigs, is that one
sometimes identifies even better systems.
''It is relatively common in commercial procurement to take the
opportunity to abort one competitive tender and redefine
specifications.''
While ''disappointed'' with McGill's withdrawal, it said the firm
would be asked to participate when the next tender was sought ''in the
early months of 1996''.
Mr Dick King, Scottish secretary of the Transport Salaried Staffs'
Association, said McGill's withdrawal was ''a strategic retreat prompted
by the realisation of hitherto unforeseen costs''.
He added: ''I have no doubt that the additional costs which McGill
would have to bear, in meeting perceived obligations under TUPE on
taking on an extra 12 employees -- not envisaged when it tendered --
have played the major, if not sole, part in persuading it to withdraw
gracefully.''
Mr King said the lesson was of ''immense importance'' to Government
plans to place railway work in the private sector: ''Any prospective
contractors will now realise there could well be considerable unseen
costs associated with TUPE obligations.
''Contractors will not wish to seek pig-in-a-poke contracts of this
nature and thus Government ambitions are likely to be thwarted.
Mr Tony Smith, director of IMU Scotland, said he was delighted that
the 12 staff jobs had been secured by McGill's withdrawal.
Labour's Scottish transport spokesman Henry McLeish was also delighted
and declared: ''It opens the way for other contracts to be challenged
because TUPE obligations have not been met.''
McGill failed to respond to inquiries from The Herald.

BERWICKSHIRE District Council last night became the first local
authority in Scotland authorised to transfer its entire housing stock to
a local housing association.
Pressure group Shelter has since expressed concern over how the needs
of homeless people in the area would be met.
A spokesman for Shelter said it would take a close look at the
Scottish Office decision and how it would affect local authorities'
statutory obligations towards homeless people.
Central government officials said the agreed price for the transferred
stock was #11.5m, based on a valuation approved by the district valuer.
The money will be used to repay council's outstanding debt on its
housing stock. The surplus of up to #755,000 will be used to make a
grant to the housing association for building new rental accommodation.
More than 2000 houses are being transferred to the Berwickshire
Housing Association which has been created specifically to own and
manage the council's housing stock.
Three-quarters of the transferable houses are in the towns of Duns,
Coldstream, Eyemouth, and Chirnside.
Housing Minister Raymond Robertson said the transfer was ''a
significant milestone'' in the Government's policy of giving tenants
more choice and control over their housing.
The Berwickshire association has registered with Scottish Homes and
its management committee will have up to 16 voluntary members, at least
four of whom will be tenants. Local authority membership will be
limited.
Council housing department staff will transfer to the new association.
The transfer decision was made after a ballot in 1994 when 79% of
eligible tenants voted with 83% in favour of transfer.

SCOTTISH Homes last night said it was to review procedures for
boarding up houses after the body of an elderly, deaf man lay
undiscovered in his Glasgow flat for several weeks. It is thought he may
have been dead for up to two months.
Mr William Smith, 74, was found dead in his flat in Shettleston by
police on Thursday morning. He had been reported missing by his sister
two days beforehand but his flat had been boarded up by Scottish Homes a
month ago.
Scottish Homes, which owned the ground-floor flat in Winning Row, said
it would now examine its procedures. Strathclyde Regional Council social
work department also said it would be conducting a full investigation
after Scottish Homes revealed it had alerted the department on August 15
that the house appeared to be empty.
Earlier, neighbours had told how workmen had boarded up the flat at
the end of July.
Scottish Homes director of housing management, Mr Richard Burn,
confirmed that the flat had been boarded up on two occasions. On July
31, a plumber was called to the flat after a neighbour heard rushing
water.
A tap was turned off through a broken window and the rear of the flat
boarded up. The front windows were boarded up on August 14 after reports
of vandalism and a visit by a housing officer.
Mr Burn said the practice to date had been to forbid entry into a
property without the permission of the tenant. However, the question of
earlier entry was being investigated.
''While we are still in the process of a thorough and detailed
investigation into precisely what happened, it is clear that, in the
light of this incident, we shall need to urgently re-examine how we deal
with such matters in the future,'' he said.
Neighbours of the dead man, who had a mild learning difficulty, said
they had seen a social worker call at the flat a week ago but this was
not confirmed by Strathclyde Regional Council's social work department,
which said it could not give details until a full investigation had been
carried out.
However, social work deputy director Bob Winter did confirm Mr Smith
had contact with his department over the last two-and-a-half years and
had been visited by a social worker every two months and was last seen
on June 27.
Police said a post-mortem examination would be carried out and a
report had been sent to the procurator-fiscal.

Mr Peter Sutherst and his wife Cynthia, from Luton, were on a day trip
to York when they passed two beggars with alsatian dogs asking for
something for a cup of tea.
Dog-loving Cynthia put her hand in her pocket to donate 50p when she
was stopped in her tracks by the sound of a phone ringing. The couple
watched open-mouthed as one of the beggars reached inside his ragged
jacket, pulled out a mobile phone, and began a conversation.
Mr Sutherst said: ''He started chatting into the phone plain as day.
We didn't hear what he was saying because we were so amazed.
''Luckily my wife had not given them the 50p..''

<HEADLINE>Hundreds of jobs to go at Hydro-Electric</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<TEXT>
HUNDREDS of jobs are to be axed at Scottish Hydro-Electric, which
announced nearly #200m profits in June.
The Perth-based firm has told staff it wants a 20% reduction in
running costs in a key part of its business over the next two and a half
years.
Preliminary talks have just begun between the privatised company and
unions and staff associations.
A Hydro-Electric spokesperson said yesterday it was ''inevitable''
that staffing levels would be reduced as a result of a review currently
under way -- but it was too early to discuss figures.
Insiders say the biggest cuts will involve engineers on the
transmission and distribution side of operations.
The company said yesterday that it wanted to avoid compulsory
redundancies ''where possible''.
It added that it would be ''inappropriate'' to go into details about
management ideas on cost-cutting until the talks with unions and staff
had taken place.
Earlier this summer, H/E was told by the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission that it should reduce its prices.
The company, which supplies electricity north of a line from Dundee to
Dunoon, had wanted to disregard the advice of the Government's
electricity watchdog, the Office of Electricity Regulation (Offer) and
become the only electricity company in Britain to refuse to cut charges
to consumers.
However, H/E will now soon agree to a cut of 8.5% in tariffs over the
next three years -- a saving of around #63 a year for the average
household.
Its main justification for refusing to cut electricity prices was the
amount of cash it was injecting on renewing rural power lines, many of
which were erected in the 1950s and 1960s.
In June, it was revealed that the company had made record profits of
almost #200m, of which it distributed #53m to shareholders.
H/E currently has a staff of 3469 and the level has not varied much
since privatisation in 1991.
The company recently branched out south of the Border and now has
stakes in five separate power plants in England.
The H/E spokesperson said: ''We are in a very competitive area which
will be more so once there is a free market in electricity in 1998.
''The Government regulator asks us to cut costs while customers want
electricity supplied as cheaply as possible. But prices can only come
down so far before there is an impact on jobs''
Mr Ian MacFarlane, a full-time official of the Amalgamated Engineering
and Electrical Union, who represents H/E employees, yesterday admitted
he was shocked when he heard of the proposed cuts.
He said: ''This is very alarming. We will be doing everything in our
power to protect our members from compulsory redundancy.''
An H/E spokeswoman said the company was halfway through a five-year
business review which would involve cutting costs and shedding jobs.
The cuts announced yesterday are in the power services division but
the company's other divisions are all still being examined for
cost-cutting opportunities.
She refused to say how many of the 1500 workers in the division would
be affected but claimed that ''a signficant proportion of any staff cuts
would come from voluntary redundancies and early retirement''.
Meanwhile, Ministers are threatening to block the #4000m sell-off of
the National Grid in a row over windfall payments to directors of the
company. Energy Minister Tim Eggar is said to be ''incandescent'' at the
apparent refusal of four directors of the National Grid to give up
technical rights to a one-off dividend.
Mr Eggar is reported to have told the regional electricity companies,
which currently own the grid, that the directors ''were morally not
entitled to the dividend''.

THOUSANDS of rail passengers were stranded on the West Coast line
between London and Scotland last night, after a tractor crashed through
a fence, down an embankment, and came to rest on the track. The tractor,
towing a muck-spreader, left a field at Bourne End, Hertfordshire, and
no Inter-City trains have been able to leave Euston on the main line
since 6.30pm. BR chiefs fear the problem may stop all night services on
one of the busiest stretches of track in the UK. A spokesman said around
12 trains were stranded but, altogether, 30 trains have been affected.
Although buses have been laid on, passengers face long delays.

A SERIES of crucial meetings and intense political activity next week
could help make or break the Northern Ireland peace process.
The activity follows yesterday's IRA statement marking the first
anniversary of the ceasefire, which accused John Major of failing to
grasp the opportunity it had given him.
The terrorists said there was a sense of ''deepening disappointment''
at the attitude of the Government. It was a ''matter of concern'' that
Britain had ''succeeded only in preventing movement towards a
resolution''.
The IRA said it had called the ceasefire to enhance the ''democratic
peace process'' and had abided by it because it believed that ''an
opportunity had been created to achieve a just and lasting peace''.
There was relief in London and Dublin that there was no threat of a
return to violence if political progress was not made soon.
The Irish Government saw the statement as helpful and as a recognition
that a lasting peace would come only as a result of inclusive
negotiation.
Sources in Dublin said both the British and Irish Governments were
committed to the objective of round table, inclusive, all-party talks to
achieve a settlement.
They said the building of the peace process on a secure foundation
needed ''quick movement towards all-party talks'' but procedures were
needed to build confidence in a demonstrable way where ''arms would not
be used and there would not be a threat to use them''.
Central to any progress will be the Chequers summit meeting between Mr
Major and Irish premier John Bruton on Wednesday, at which they will try
to break the present impasse and inject renewed momentum into the
process.
The two leaders are expected to finalise proposals for the
establishment of an international commission to oversee the handing in
of both IRA and loyalist weapons.
Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams warned the British and Irish
Governments last night not to underestimate the critical importance of
the Chequers summit.
Mr Adams said: ''The summit must produce a clear indication that
all-party peace talks are to commence by a given date if this crisis in
the peace process is not to deepen.''
He said the demand for an IRA surrender of weapons or for the IRA to
co-operate with an international commission to oversee such a surrender,
as a precondition for peace talks, provided Sinn Fein with no room for
manoeuvre and the British Government knew that.
''There is a transparent attempt under way by the British Government,
through controlled leaks, innuendo, public comments and private
briefings, to unnerve people and set the parameters for Chequers
significantly lower than those required by the urgency of the current
situation.
''These predictable manoeuvres by London must not succeed.''
He added there was a heavy onus on the Irish Government not to allow
the best chance in generations for a lasting peace to be ''squandered''
by Britain.
''The peace process is a life and death effort to put behind us the
tragedy of the past,'' he said.
That could occur only when all parties were engaged as equals in
negotiations. ''The British Government cannot be permitted to dictate
the terms of the forthcoming summit or to create a situation where the
summit delivers the British position.''
On Monday, Ulster Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew is due to have his
long-awaited fourth meeting with Mr Adams. The same day, Sir Patrick
will meet Irish Deputy Prime Minister Dick Spring in Dublin for final
pre-summit talks.
That night, Labour leader Tony Blair will also meet Mr Spring in
Dublin.
At the same time, Sinn Fein strategist Martin McGuinness leaves for a
six-day trip to the United States.
It will be his first visit and has engendered considerable interest
because of his role of republican negotiator in secret contacts with the
Government in advance of the IRA ceasefire and in talks with Ministers
and officials since.

A FOOTBALLER who was a member of the Cameroon squad which was defeated
after extra time by England in the quarter-finals of the 1990 World Cup
in Italy is seeking political asylum in Scotland.
Goalkeeper Andre Boe, 31, who has played 60 times for his country, and
was on the bench during the 3-2 defeat by England, has been in Scotland
for the past three weeks and is at present training with Scottish First
Division side Greenock Morton.
The footballer -- voted African Player of the Year by football writers
in season 1988-89 -- left Cameroon in December and played with Toulon
and Le Mans in France. He had trials with Arsenal in England during
early summer, before arriving in Scotland.
Speaking at a friend's house in Glasgow yesterday, Mr Boe said: ''So
many political and financial problems have beset my country I feel that
I cannot return there.''
He said he had sought political asylum through the Home Office.
Mr Tony Higgins, secretary of the Scottish Professional Footballers'
Association, said he had been contacted by the player and had in turn
circulated all senior clubs in Scotland, making them aware of his
availability.
The SPFA is restricted by a directive which allows 10 non-EU
professional players to play in Scotland. At present, there are nine.
Mr Higgins explained that, under normal circumstances, non-EU players
have to obtain a work permit which is granted only if a player meets
criteria laid down by the Department of Employment's overseas labour
section.
This demands that a non-EU player must have played in at least 75% of
his country's previous internationals played in the past two years.
Mr Higgins said: ''It would appear that the Home Office is happy that
Mr Boe meets the criteria, because he has been told that he can play
professional football in this country without a work permit until his
political asylum case is considered.''
Morton manager, Mr Allan McGraw, said: ''The player has obviously
looked after himself and appears to be very fit. He will play against
Clydebank reserves on Monday and if he continues to show well we will
offer him a contract. Whether he accepts it or not is a different
matter.''

POLICE are investigating a series of suspicious deaths at a hostel for
homeless men in Birmingham.
Detectives would not confirm reports that the inquiry involved as many
as 16 deaths at Summerhill Hostel in Ladywell.
A man, 65, has been arrested in connection with one death, that of an
82-year-old resident in 1988.
The arrest follows an eight-month police inquiry into allegations of
physical abuse at the hostel. Officers were called in after an internal
investigation by Birmingham City Council.
The officer leading the inquiry, Detective Superintendent Bob
Minshull, said: ''It is fair to say that we are investigating more than
one suspicious death. We are still tracing and interviewing witnesses
and have already spoken to more than 100 people.''
The alleged offences were all said to have taken place before April
1993, when the Labour-run city council handed over control of the centre
to Focus Housing Association.
The investigation was said to have proved difficult as the alleged
abuse extended back over a period of time.
The hostel, formerly known as Summerhill Residential Home for Men, was
set up by the council in 1975 and attracted national interest because of
its apparent success in rehabilitating older men who had been homeless
on the streets of Birmingham.
A spokesman for West Midlands Police said the man being held was not
being questioned about any other suspicious deaths at present.
A spokesman said: ''We have not given any figure for the number of
incidents being investigated and are not going to at this stage. It is
right that we are investigating a number of suspicious deaths and the
man is still being questioned by officers.''
Social services officers have confirmed that the man being questioned
is a former Birmingham City Council employee at Summerhill Hostel but
will not give details of his former position.
Officers of Focus Housing Association are offering counselling to the
home's 32 residents because of publicity surrounding the investigation.

A RARE collaboration between Edinburgh's three festivals -- the
International Festival, the Fringe, and the Drambuie Film Festival --
was launched yesterday for 1996.
The three organisations are hoping to stage a series of joint events
to mark their 50th programmes, as well as anniversary events within
their own programmes.
Plans are at an early stage but a logo celebrating 50 festival years
has been agreed and will be used by each organisation. It will also be
available to other organisations and businesses in the city.
Mr Brian McMaster, director of the International Festival, said:
''This is a real opportunity for Edinburgh to widen the impact of and
the audience for the festivals. The extent to which we are able to
maximise the use of that resource depends on the amount of money we are
able to raise to do it.''
Mr McMaster noted that France's Avignon festival, which has a smaller
overall budget of #2m, was given #800,000 extra for its 50th
celebrations, which also fall next year.
Fringe director Ms Hilary Strong said the collaboration would not
change the open-to-all nature of the Fringe. ''It is an opportunity for
entrepreneurs and programmers,'' she said.
The Fringe's plans include a circus school for 180 children which will
culminate in an event on the Fringe.
Other plans being considered are an exhibition covering the history of
all three festivals, free events in Princes Street Gardens, and open air
film and orchestral performances.

MILLIONS of home owners were given an unexpected bonus yesterday when
Britain's second biggest mortgage lender cut its headline mortgage rate
in a move designed to restore a feelgood factor to the housing market.
The move, which coincided with fresh evidence of chronic weakness in
the housing market, could spark off a price war between banks and
building societies. Rates paid to customers with savings in building
societies are also expected to fall.
The Abbey National cut its standard mortgage rate by 0.35% to 7.99%,
reducing the cost of a typical #50,000 mortgage by around #13 a month.
The lower rate comes into effect for new loans on Monday and for
existing borrowers from October 1.
Other major lenders are likely to follow the Abbey's lead. The Halifax
Building Society, the number one in the mortgage business, said: ''It's
obviously a very competitive rate and we will have to consider our
response.''
The Nationwide Building Society also said it was reviewing its
position and the Newcastle-based Northern Rock is cutting its base rate
by 0.55% to 7.99% with immediate effect for new loans and from October
16 for existing borrowers.
The Abbey said: ''With the threat of a UK base rate rise receding and
inflation remaining under control, Abbey National aims to reward the
loyalty of existing customers, offer an added benefit to new customers,
and give the market a boost.'' It added that savings rates were under
review and details would be published shortly.
Banks and building societies have been competing in a lack-lustre
mortgage market, with discounted rates and cash-back offers for new
customers. Terms for fixed-rate mortgages have fallen sharply in recent
months.

THE Foreign Ministers of Bosnia, Croatia, and Yugoslavia will meet in
Geneva next week for talks on ending the conflict in former Yugoslavia.
The breakthrough announcement was made simultaneously in Washington
and Belgrade following intensive diplomacy by US special envoy Richard
Holbrooke and Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic.
The Geneva talks would be aimed at preparing for an international
conference on peace in the region, an official statement from
Milosevic's office said.
''Both sides expected the American peace initiative to achieve success
since, as stressed, it offers a constructive framework for key elements
vital to a political settlement of the crisis,'' it added.
''These negotiations will be complicated and they will be difficult,
but are unquestionably in the best interests of all the parties to the
conflict and the international community,'' US State Department
spokesman Nicholas Burns said in Washington.
The spokesman said the meeting in Geneva would take place at the end
of the week and last a day or so.
The members of the Contact Group -- Britain, France, Germany and
Russia, as well as the United States -- and some other countries will
attend the meeting. Burns said its purpose was to lay down the basic
principles for a settlement of the Bosnian question.
The diplomatic achievement was the result of a risky twin-track
strategy of shuttle talks coupled with an unprecedented Nato bombardment
of Bosnian Serb forces to punish them for shelling Sarajevo but also to
convince them they could not win on the battlefield and should accept
negotiation.
Holbrooke, beginning a day of talks with Milosevic and a team of
Bosnian Serb delegates, said earlier: ''The number one priority is
Bosnia and the number one issue is the map.
''Everyone has agreed to the 51%-49% split but everyone's idea of
51%-49% is different,'' he said.
In addition to the war in Bosnia between government forces, their
Bosnian Croat allies and separatist Serbs, the talks will focus on an
overall settlement of the Yugoslav crisis which erupted in conflict in
1991 when the old federation broke up.
Separatist Serbs still hold a part of Croatia and fighting continues
on the border of Croatia and Bosnia in the Dubrovnik hinterland.
Fighting erupted yesterday around the UN-declared ''safe area'' of
Bihac in western Bosnia, where the heaviest clashes were reported since
a Croatian offensive a month ago broke a three-year Serb siege of the
pocket.
A UN spokesman said more than 300 explosions were recorded in the
area.
Sarajevo radio said three people were killed and several wounded in
Bosnian Serb artillery attacks.
Bosnian Serb radio said mainly-Muslim troops from the Bihac enclave
were launching artillery and infantry attacks on Bosnian Serb positions.
The Americans have put strong pressure on the Serbs to accept their
latest peace plan. The fact that the parties have agreed to meet in
Geneva does not mean that they have acquiesced in the plan, which would
substantially restrict Bosnia future independence and would also mean
the Serbs giving up a part of the land they have occupied in Bosnia.
In Hawaii, where he was to preside over 50th anniversary
commemorations of the victory over Japan in the Second World War,
President Bill Clinton said the agreement to negotiate was ''a positive
step forward, but much remains to be done''.
In the meantime, he told a gathering of war veterans: ''No-one should
doubt Nato's resolve to prevent the further slaughter of innocent
civilians in Sarajevo and the other safe areas in Bosnia.''
Nato warplanes paused in their bombardment of Serb targets in Bosnia
earlier yesterday while the UN's top general met Bosnian Serb commander
Ratko Mladic.
However, Bosnian Serb gunners ignored the conciliatory gesture and UN
Rapid Reaction Force artillery on Mount Igman roared into action to
destroy a Serb missile site that opened up on a Nato plane.
British guns pounded the SAM-6 missile launcher with more than 90
rounds while French forces fired 24 155mm shells at a rocket being
readied to fire at Sarajevo.
The pause in the air operation after Nato flew some 500 sorties over
Bosnia allowed UN force commander General Bernard Janvier to meet Mladic
to explain the conditions for halting attacks permanently.
The UN has demanded the Bosnian Serbs pull all their heavy weapons out
of range of Sarajevo and stop threatening other ''safe areas'' before it
calls a full halt to the bombing.
There had been no formal Bosnian Serb army response to the UN demands.
The Bosnian Government condemned the pause, saying it eased the
pressure on the Serbs and would not help the cause of peace.
Meanwhile in Brussels, the European Commission confirmed yesterday
that five EU monitors in Bosnia had not yet been released by the Bosnian
Serbs.
''They are presumably alive and safe but they are not allowed to leave
Serb-held territory,'' Joao Vale de Almeida, a Commission spokesman,
said.

Herald journalist KIRSTY SCOTT spent Thursday night on the summit of
Mount Igman. Here is her report.
WHEN the guns are still, the summit of Mount Igman is shrouded in a
silence so deep you can hear every breath, every footfall, every frozen
stamp of a soldier's boot.
The Devon and Dorset are just to the front of us, the Highland Gunners
somewhere to the left. It is getting dark and, as we try to fix
positions around us, the guns to the fore open up on Serb positions,
four massive blasts with only a muffled yell as a warning.
The French soldiers at the forward command post are momentarily caught
off guard, one scanning the sky for any sign of an incoming mortar
shell.
Maybe an hour later, we hear the first drone of an aircraft, then
more, regularly, crossing this way and that. Just after 1.30am, a fresh
wave appears, one screaming in low overhead and behind the fading roar a
series of dull thuds scattering outside the suburbs of Sarajevo.
The activity has brought other visitors to Mount Igman -- a group of
three Bosnian soldiers, breaths sour with drink, who screech up the
tortuous Sarajevo stretch of the Igman track with steam billowing from
the bonnet of their car.
As they wait for water for the radiator, they insist we go with them
down through the forest and across Serb lines where we can watch them
select and slaughter a Chetnik soldier. It will be a real story, they
tell us.
Irritated at our unwillingness to participate, they prod our flak
jackets and make rapid-fire noises. The French come to investigate and
persuade them to leave, but not before they pretend to ram the
checkpoint with their car and speed off into the blackness towards
Sarajevo.
There has been a steady stream of traffic over the Igman route all
night -- aid trucks, lorries packed with silent hordes, small cars with
their lights off, all buoyed by cautious optimism about the Nato
strikes.
At 7am, the French take pity on our frozen forms and fetch hot water
with the promise of tea. Overhead, the sky is criss-crossed with jet
trails and, as the mist clears, a fresh barrage of about 15 rounds rips
out of a gun placement to the left, the noise bouncing between the
fir-covered peaks on either side.
The French cock their heads sideways, listening for any response but
the Serbs stay silent, for now.
There is a real feeling of satisfaction here, a sense of achievement
and relief at finally being able to strike back.
''It's just ace, isn't it,'' said a beaming corporal from the Devon
and Dorset, dug in at a small settlement just below the summit. ''It was
about time we did something. The force has just been stuck here for so
long it was frustrating for us.''
Having said that, we did have to prepare the ground and the positions
and find out what was down there.''
Despite his bullish mood, however, the corporal admitted no-one could
predict how the Serbs would react -- whether they agreed to come to the
negotiating table or not.
''Personally, I think the Serbs will hit back, but probably not with
artillery,'' said the corporal. ''I think they'll maybe try their old
ways and try to take some hostages.
It's the only way they could get the bombing to stop.
''That's what I fear but you just can't ever tell what the Serbs will
be like. They are totally unpredictable.''
Over in Split, the British forces spokesman, Barry Hawgood, has
similar thoughts. ''The Serbs must be spitting tacks just now and we
have been expecting that they may try to strike back, either on Mount
Igman or maybe in Ploce on the coast.
''But just now, morale on the top is excellent. They've just been
sitting there for two months.''
If there is a sense of satisfaction at the summit, then the mood
further down has been close to euphoric.
In a small hamlet less than a mile from the Serb lines, Vehid Sehic
and his wife, Zuhreta, are standing defiantly in front of their home,
savouring the knowledge that the shellfire around them is aimed this
time at their persecutors. They grab our arms and point at positions on
the nearby hills where the Serbs had been dug in
Zuhreta drags me to her cabbage patch to see where the shells landed.
Further up the road, the hamlet's tiny mosque has been all but gutted,
its side charred and broken by bullets and mortars.
Vehid has an AK47 slung across his shoulder. He says it is a Chetnik
weapon which his 21-year-old son, Vahidin, stole from the body of a Serb
he had killed. Vahidin is brought from the house, sleepy and a little
puzzled by all the attention.
His parents produce grainy photographs of him in a group of soldiers,
garlands of ammunition strung around their necks. ''Serb,'' said
Vahidin, patting the rifle. At the mention of Nato and the Rapid
Reaction Force, his mother lifts her hands to Mount Igman and slaps them
up and down to imitate bombs.
We left her there, arms raised and a broad, broad grin stretching
across her lined and weary face.
