SCOTLAND keeper Andy Goram may still have a contribution to make to
the European Championship qualifying programme this season, despite the
injuries that have kept him out of action for most of this year. Rangers
manager Walter Smith yesterday reckoned that his No.1 goalie would be
ready to play again in two weeks' time which would give Goram the chance
to stake his claim for a return to the national side for the last two
games of the season, against San Marino on April 26 and Faroe Islands on
June 7.
That would depend very much on him proving that the calf injury which
has twice forced him into the treatment room has healed. The keeper has
not played for his club since he suffered a recurrence of the injury in
a premier-division game with Partick Thistle on January 7. That was his
first game back following a three-match absence after he suffered the
injury playing for Scotland in Greece last December.
He was taken off that day and replaced by Jim Leighton who then went
on to have a marvellous game for his country in the only European
Championship match since, against Russia in Moscow last month. Now, he
could be set to challenge the Hibs man for that place when the squads
for the two qualifying games against the rank outsiders in the group are
chosen.
Goram had to miss out on three holiday matches at the turn of the year
as a result of the injury in Greece and maybe came back a little too
quickly when he played against Thistle in January but Smith is
determined to make certain that every preaution is taken against that
this time.
''Andy is close to fitness now and I would think in two weeks' time he
would be ready to play,'' he said and added that a couple of warm-up
matches might well help along the way.
If all goes according to plan, Goram could also be available for the
international trip to Japan next month which will not include Tennents
Scottish Cup final players. With Leighton still hoping to be one of them
after tonight's sem-final replay, a fit Goram could be vital to the
plans of manager Craig Brown.
Another Scotland man who had hopes of breaking back into the side for
the summer spell, Hearts' John Robertson, can forget about that
possibility. The striker who would have been in the squad for Moscow but
for injury suffered a minor fracture to an arm in the semi-final defeat
by Airdrie and, although it does not appear serious, he is unlikely to
play again this season.
However, it might not be beyond possibility that a fellow striker who
has had a miserable season, Rangers' Ally McCoist, would be a candidate
for those Scotland fixtures. Smith said yesterday that Ally is also
expected to play again before the season ends and if he manages that
without mishap he, too, could enter Brown's plans.

Bucharest
THE Scotland Under-19 rugby party, in Romania for the FIRA Junior
World Cup, has been hit by injury even before the tournament is under
way.
Middlesbrough prop David Butcher, who played in the game against
England 10 days ago, has a back injury and is to be replaced by Grant
Talac of Musselburgh.
Butcher's injury was picked up against the English, but aggravated in
training on Saturday. He was examined by team doctor Harry Burnett, and
the decision was taken to call Murrayfield for a replacement.
Butcher, at 6ft 1in and 15st 7lb, will be badly missed, although Talac
was a member of the provisional FIRA squad.
He arrived in Bucharest yesterday, accompanied by Scottish Rugby Union
Director of Rugby Jim Telfer, and immediately finds a place on the bench
for today's opening game against Russia.
Alan Bulloch, the Hutchesons' Grammar School centre who played for
Scottish Schools against Ireland on Saturday and who was called in to
the party last week as a late replacement for the injured Craig Murray,
also flew to the Romanian capital with Telfer. He, too, has been
nominated as a replacement for today's match.
With four games to be played over the seven days of the tournament,
Scotland coaches Alastair Christie and Roy Laidlaw are having to employ
their playing resources with great care.
''We have two games on consecutive days and four games in the week, so
to try to play your best side each day would be tantamount to suicide,''
said Christie.
After today's match, the Scots play Argentina tomorrow. Both Russia
and Argentina are expected to offer a stiff physical challenge, but the
Argentinians, as more of a known quantity, are expected to provide the
sterner test.
''The side we are putting out against Russia may not be too far away
from the optimum team, but it is a bit of a gamble nevertheless,''
Christie said.
''In one sense, because not a lot is known about the Russians, that
works to our advantage. It allows us to play the kind of game we want to
play, without concentrating overmuch on what the Russians will be
doing.''
Laidlaw, who is in charge of the backs, was full of praise for the
decision to allow the young Scots to take part in the FIRA competition.
''Coming away with the boys for 10 days really allows them to develop
as individuals and as a group. Win or lose this week, there is no doubt
in my mind that all of these players will have benefited enormously from
the exercise.''
The Welsh side, the only other Home Union nation in the competition,
arrived in Bucharest on Sunday night. They are staying in the same hotel
as the Scottish party.
The Scots have been here since Friday, and both Christie and Laidlaw
reckoned that the two extra days have been of immense value, allowing
the youngsters to acclimatise and come to terms with the austere nature
of their surroundings.
Team:
R F Williams (Stewarty); G D Caldwell (Ayr), S Jenkins (Kilmarnock), R
D Kennedy (Stirling County) captain, D J Bull (Stewart's Melville); G S
Dalgleish (Gala), J W Weston; M P J Smith (both Watsonians), G Hodgson
(Newcastle/Gosforth), J R Kelly (Harlequins), E Boyd
(Boroughmuir/Caithness), I A Fullerton (Kelso), A M Cadzow
(Boroughmuir/Caithness), C E Macdonald (Edinburgh Academicals), S
McNeill (Ross High). Replacements -- S M Tomlinson (Selkirk), G J H Hay
(Watsonians), A J Bulloch (Hutchesons' GS), S Murray (Edinburgh
Academicals), G Talac (Musselburgh), G Lambie (Edinburgh Wanderers), C
Docherty (GHK).
Yesterday, the Scotland management watched the Russians and
Argentinians in their opening-round tie at the Parcul Copiluluii ground
and video-taped the match for showing last night.
Both sides were big and strong, but the Russians lacked the technical
know-how to cope with occasional Argentinian flair, and the South
Americans won easily 32-6. Scotland manager David Sole said he had seen
nothing to cause him real concern.
Results:
Group A -- South Africa 61, Poland 6; Italy 34, Portugal 10; France
27, Romania 27; Argentina 32, Russia 6.

SCOTTISH football has finally woken up to reality. The SFA yesterday
admitted the decline in the Scottish game is so severe that drastic
action must be taken -- and they have reached into their past to ensure
a brighter future.
In the months ahead, plain speaking will be the order of the day and
the words, many of them harsh, will come from none other than Ernie
Walker, who returns to the Scottish game as official troubleshooter.
Best keep the children and more sensitive creatures among the many SFA
members indoors.
The former SFA secretary will not spare the feelings of anyone he
believes represents a barrier to progress as he points the way out of
the wilderness and he wasted little time in making his presence felt.
Only an hour or so after the SFA council agreed to allow outsiders to
look in and scrutinise an organisation 122 years old, Walker declared
his work will ''certainly be the most sweeping review ever of Scottish
football.''
It has been too long in coming but, at last, the SFA have recognised
the need for change and given their approval to have outsiders examine
in detail every aspect of the sport in Scotland and to make
recommendations on how best to modernise a governing body which many
outsiders have come to regard as archaic, stuffy, and tired.
Former SFA secretary Walker will chair the Independent Review Body for
Scottish Football and will assume absolute power in appointing his team
which will have a two to three-year life-span during which time every
aspect of the game will be covered including the best possible league
set-up. Walker realises the need to provide an environment in which a
better class of young player will be allowed to flourish.
''This body will comprise eminent people from throughout Scottish
life,'' said Walker, who was with the SFA for 32 years, 13 of which were
as secretary. Walker, now 65 years old, moved aside five years ago and
although he is still heavily involved with FIFA and UEFA, he stressed he
has no connection with the SFA.
''The go-ahead has just been given and I will have to refine my
thoughts, but none of the people on the review body will have any
strings attached to the SFA and a couple will be from other countries.
We have to look at what others are doing,'' he said.
''I have been approached because I am au fait with the workings and
the background of Scottish football and, in my opinion, it seems we have
fallen behind most of the rest of the world.
''In the last few weeks I have been at games involving Barcelona,
Paris St Germain, and AC Milan and compared with last Saturday's game at
Hampden Park we were looking at two different things.
''One was a game of football and the other was a contest of some
description.''
The SFA's rules revision committee had been looking at the possibility
of making the association a more efficient power but it became clear
outside help was required. ''We need to be in a position to meet the
challenges of the new millenium,'' said SFA chief executive Jim Farry
who succeeded Walker in May 1990.
Of course, many supporters will be sceptical of the review body which
is to be given a budget -- the future could cost as much as a top-class
player -- and may even regard it as a job for one of the old boys, but
that is too simplistic a view and also an insult to Walker, who didn't
need another task to add to those he already performs.
The fact is he has long been deeply troubled by the declining
standards of the Scottish game, a problem which has registered more
forcibly with him because his work for football's European and governing
bodies -- he is chairman of the UEFA Stadia Committee and an executive
director of their Easter European Assistance Bureau as well as being a
member of FIFA's appeals committee and author of a book on football
stadia -- regularly brings the differences between the world game and
our own vividly into focus.
If the SFA wished merely to be seen to be responding to outside
pressures they would not have given Walker, who once described the
Uruguayan national side as ''scum of the earth'' and who was dubbed the
Ayatollah during his reign at the SFA, a thought. Five years of
travelling the world has not blunted his approach.
Walker is not the type for a whitewash and neither will he lose sleep
over the possibility of hurting people within the game if he feels they
are obstacles towards progress. ''The SFA have been courageous in taking
this step because no-one, certainly no-one in football, likes the
thought of losing a position, but it might be the review body will
recommend that the SFA council should be scrapped,'' he said.
It was vintage Walker with a sting. ''Also, it could be that we will
say the chief executive should be sacked if he is not doing a good
enough job,'' he continued.
However, even though this column has frequently critcised the work of
the SFA it has to be said Farry boldly has steered the association along
a path which may end with the game's salvation. He could have pushed for
someone other than the man to whom he was frequently compared in his
first couple of years in office, but Farry has remained true to his
word.
When he took over he said he would restructure the game from the
bottom up and with an enlarged technical department in place, extensive
community coaching schemes operating, and a general movement towards
small-sided games for children, Farry felt it was time to look at the
top of the hill. ''It was time to look at ourselves,'' he said.
Only time will tell, of course, but it can be assumed the SFA have not
gone to these lengths with the intention of dismissing most of the
review body's recommendations a few years down the line. Even if they
did, they would find it difficult because it is Walker's intention to
remain in close contact with the media.
''This will not be a secret organisation,'' he said. ''Everybody will
be kept aware of what is happening.
''We will have to look at the work of one or two of the younger
associations like the Dutch and the Swedes, and this is a public
admission that we in this country don't know all there is to know about
this game. Too many still believe coaching is something evil and
somewhere along the line we have got to change attitudes towards
football.
''We must try to ensure that we produce a more skilful player in ther
future.''
' This body will comprise eminent people from throughout Scottish life
'

EDINBURGH Racers' coach Jock Hay last night prepared his British
Championship-chasing side for Saturday's semi-final at Wembley Arena and
declared: ''We don't fear Nottingham Panthers.''
The Lace City combine -- who led the league for most of the season
before falling away badly in the run-in -- mauled Racers 19-2 in their
Benson &amp; Hedges Cup semi-final but Hay said: ''That's history.'' Since
then the Edinburgh cracks have won two of their five jousts with Mike
Blaisdell's powerful side.
Hay, who pocketed a British Championship winners' medal with Racers in
the 1986 final, said: ''We have the firepower to shoot down any club in
the league.
''Panthers a strong club with two good lines. We also have two good
lines and can match them.''
Racers, Scotland's last hopes, will be at full-strength for Saturday's
night's clash, with the return of flu victim Mike Ware.
The winners meet either defending champions Cardiff Devils or new
premier division title-holders Sheffield Steelers in Sunday's final,
also at Wembley.

AIRDRIE, the first homeless team to reach the Scottish Cup final,
might have a new stadium in prospect by the time they walk out at
Hampden on May 27. The club, which has been using Clyde's Broadwood
Stadium in Cumbernauld for its home matches this season and Stratchlyde
Park as its training centre, should have a better idea of the future in
the next few weeks.
Airdrie sold their home ground, Broomfield, to supermarket company
Safeway at the end of last season, but are awaiting planning permission
to build a 10,000 all-seater stadium at Raebog, Glenmavis, on the
outskirts of the town. If the plan goes ahead, they would share the new
ground with Coatbridge neighbours and rivals Albion Rovers.
Airdrie have had planning permission granted by Monklands District
Council, but Strathclyde Region have not yet given approval for the new
ground, which would be on a greenfield site. Now the Scottish Secretary
has been asked to make a decision on the #7m project.
Club chairman George Peat said: ''We should hear from Ian Lang in the
next two or three weeks. We are in limbo at the moment.''
If approval is granted, work would start soon, but it may still be the
case that Airdrie will ask Clyde to provide them with a temporary base
for another season.
However, it should not be assumed that the gypsy cup finalists will
let all of this deter them from their basic aim, to win the cup and
become the first Scottish homeless team to play in Europe. .
Getting to the final was their major task, and now that has been
achieved, the players who missed out the last time they were there,
Kenny Black and JimmY Sandison, are determined to make it this time.
Both were suspended when Airdrie lost to Rangers in the 1992 final,
and both had enough yellow cards against their names to be in real
danger of missing out again.
In fact, Black ran a little close to the edge when he was booked in
the semi-final win over Hearts on Saturday, a booking that brought with
it a suspension. However, the former Hearts man's four-game ban will be
completed just in time for the final.
Sandison is still in danger of missing out, and now waits to see if
manager Alex MacDonald will keep him in reserve for the big game.
Sandison is on 15 points, one below the threshold, after which he would
receive a two-match suspension.
Whatever is decided, the team captain seems quite resolved to be at
Hampden on May 27, on the park this time. First, though, Airdrie are
still chasing promotion and continue that quest tonight against
Clydebank at Kilbowie Park.
Airdrie are in fourth place, eight behind leaders Raith Rovers but
have a game in hand.

CARETAKER manager Roy Aitken has demanded that Aberdeen find the
killer touch to save their premier league place. He admitted yesterday
that Dons must become ruthless in their next two games, against Celtic
and Motherwell.
Aitken also called for rock-bottom Reds to follow the example of
champions Rangers. ''It is so frustrating to have played so well in our
last three games and to have taken just one point.
''However, we arecapable of getting there if we maintain these
standards and become more aggressive. That is what makes Rangers so
successful. They know how to win games from week to week.
''The next two matches are vital. We must turn performances into
points and pressure the teams above us.''

CITY of Glasgow Ragazzi have three players in the British men's squad
for the Easter matches against Denmark.
Captain Iain Grubb has been joined by setter Kenny Milne and the
much-improved Gary McGuire. Rucanor Jets' Geoff Marshall would have been
included but was unavailable because of work commitments.
The team fly out at the end of the week for matches on Sunday and
Monday, with City of Glasgow Ragazzi coach Tommy Dowens going as Ralph
Hippolyte's assistant.
Hippolyte hopes his team can shock the Danes and build on their recent
performances, the most notable of which was a win over Australia at the
Kelvin Hall 16 months ago.
The British have to be content with repeating such upsets in the hope
of improved funding. ''What we have to do is ambush teams. It is like
guerrilla warfare -- we try to cause havoc with a nation that has been
working for eight years on an international programme,'' Hippolyte
points out.
The 8th Falkirk Boys' Brigade won the British BB title for the third
successive year by beating Ireland's Garva 15-4, 15-3, 15-1 at the
weekend in Craigavon, Northern Ireland.

HIBS winger Micky Weir has missed his chance to play in the Scottish
Cup semi-final against Celtic at Ibrox tonight in the crunch replay and
will be fined by manager Alex Miller after having been ordered off in a
reserve game at the weekend.
Yesterday, Miller snapped: ''It is very disappointing and
unprofessional for a player to get himself ordered off in a reserve game
when he could have been an important addition to our squad for the
replay.
''I said immediately after the game on Friday that Weir was someone
who would come into our plans. Now he is out, and it's not good
enough.''
Furious Miller revealed that Weir, sent off for the second time in a
week, would be disciplined, and it is certain he will receive a heavy
fine.
Weir, 29, missed the first game against Celtic because he had been
sent off against Partick Thistle in the previous premier league game.
Miller looked certain to use him at some stage tonight. After the 0-0
draw, the Hibs boss had insisted he would make changes, and stressed he
was unhappy with the way his team had played from midfield to front.
That is where the changes were to be made, and Weir's name was the
first of three Miller mentioned who would threaten the men given their
chance in the first clash. Now the manager has only two names with which
to juggle, Kevin McAllister and Gareth Evans.
Celtic, meanwhile, remain convinced they can reach their second major
final of the season, and refuse to accept that any extra pressure has
been heaped on them by Andy Walker's penalty miss in the first game.
Asked about ''pressure'' yesterday, manager Tommy Burns was swift to
point out that Celtic had dominated the last time.
''We have to make sure the players are relaxed, and I think we were
able to do that for the first match,'' he said. ''We just have to follow
the same route.
''There are one or two knocks around, but only Pierre van Hooydonk is
a problem after the hamstring strain he picked up on Friday.
''We won't gamble with him, but he trained today and has made really
good progress. He has not been troubled by this kind of injury before,
which is in his favour.''
I think the Dutchman will play, and while Burns talks of perhaps one
further change, it is difficult to see where he would make it after
expressing his delight with the last performance.
A place for record signing Phil O'Donnell? That could come only at the
expense of Paul McStay or John Collins, who, along with Peter Grant,
formed a potent midfield against Hibs.
Burns did talk about young Simon Donnelly returning to the squad, but
it is difficult to see him upsetting the strike force used already.
As for the penalty taker, Burns remained happy that the players will
decide themselves, even though Walker's decision to take over from
Collins might have cost them victory at Ibrox.
Burns said: ''The players are highly-paid professionals who should be
able to make these decisions out on the field.
''You can have desiganted penalty takers, then find out that during a
game they suddenly don't want the responsibility; they are taking a step
back. That's no use.
''If someone wants to take the kick, then that is a good sign,
although I do think that you will find John Collins gets to the ball
first if we get another in the replay.''
Hibs will look for an improvement in their attacking play. They must,
if they want to make it to Hampden and the final next month. They will
hope, too, that skipper Gordon Hunter will be fit, but I believe he will
miss the match.
However, considering how Steven Tweed and Andy Millen combined first
time round, that is not as big a blow as Hibs' fans might think.
Celtic should have won last time round, and tonight I am convinced
they will make sure of a final place and end the trophy jinx that has
haunted them for so long.

SCOTLAND'S men beat Norway 9-3 in their only game yesterday at the
Ford World Championships at Brandon, Manitoba.
Earlier, Scotland's women went down to their second defeat, by 5-4 to
European champions, Denmark, and, even at this early stage, have given
themselves a tough job to make the semi-finals.
The men won the toss and took a single at the first end but Norway
responded with a single at the second.
The next two ends were blanked but in the fifth the Scots drew for 2
and a 3-1 cushion.
The Scots had steals at each of the next two ends but in the eighth
the Norwegians scored 2 to bring the game back to 5-3.
But in the ninth, a count of 4 gave the Scots victory. Results:
MEN. Third round -- Sweden 5, Wales 6; Germany 8, USA 5; Switzerland
6, England 4; Australia 4, Scotland 5; Norway 2, Canada 8.
Fourth round -- Germany 4, Switzerland 3; Norway 3, Scotland 9; Canada
8, Wales 2; Sweden 5, England 2; USA 9, Australia 6.

A NEW tourist centre, near Balmoral Castle, the Queen's Highland home
on Deeside, opened yesterday. The #140,000 centre stands between the

CLUB steward Alexander Noble, 28, admitted at Falkirk Sheriff Court
yesterday that he embezzled #4400 from Callendar Miners' Welfare Society
in Glen Village, Falkirk, to feed his gambling habit. Sheriff Albert
Sheehan deferred sentence until April 27 for reports and warned Noble he
was considering a custodial sentence. The sheriff said: ''This is a very
bad breach of trust.''

Catherine Brindley talks to opera director and rabble-rouser Peter
Sellars about the show he is putting together for Edinburgh
SPEAKING in Los Angeles, controversial opera director Peter Sellars
confirmed that the ''earthquake romance'' he'll bring to the next
Edinburgh Festival will be a West Side Story-style musical -- although
''100% original'' -- with a cast of seven, all in their twenties.
''To most young people in America,'' he said, ''the Generation X tag
picked up by the media is ludicrous. Young people in our society have
been looked down on and their forms ridiculed. They're now under attack
from Newt Gingrich and other grey suits who are wilfully dismantling the
welfare and education system.''
Sellars is known internationally as a populist with a yen for
radically re-staging classical opera and drama. The Gulf War version of
The Persians he brought to Edinburgh on his last trip is a case in
point. But on home turf the puckish rabble-rouser, who clearly relishes
the brickbats and bouquets his work provokes, is a resident evangelist
for Los Angeles and the young immigrant communities that spring up here.
A 60s Harvard graduate, he is also known for his political agenda and,
though much in demand, he still finds time to teach ''art and social
responsibility'' and ''art as moral action'' at the University of
California in Los Angeles.
The work he's bringing to Edinburgh, I Was Looking at the Ceiling and
Then I Saw the Sky, went into rehearsal at the end of March. According
to Sellars the show is his ''purest article of faith'' in young people
to date.
If the title sounds like a haiku, it's because the libretto was
supplied by renowned African-American poet June Jordan. Local graffiti
artists will work on set design. An eight-piece electric and will play
the music of Sellar's long-time associate John Adams.
The musical took five months to cast in LA and New York and the
director is confident of the dynamism and talent of his actors.
Characters include a ''sleep-around, soul-saving, up-and-coming leading
light of the Baptist Church'', and illegal Salvadorian worker; a gang
member about to go down for petty theft under California's ''three
strikes and you're out'' law, and a brash young ''reality television''
producer trying to capture it all on tape.
The big difference between this work and the inter-generational
stories he's directed in the past is, says Sellars, ''the amount of love
on the stage. The backdrop is the LA earthquake and we refer to the new
racism of Californian politics, but it is essentially a love story
between two young people.
Written to be portable and small enough to play in theatres, I was
Looking . . . will open in San Francisco and tour mainland Europe before
arriving in Edinburgh. In the past Peter Sellars has called Los Angeles
the most likely model for the international society of the future. In
the shadow of recent political events, today he recognises the breakdown
that has occured in the city.
When his new musical arrives in Edinburgh, it will be an invitation to
look through the smog of the LA riots, fires, and earthquake and the
absurdities of the OJ Simpson trial, and see the potential of the young
people who live in LA and -- continue to arrive here daily.

STERN by name, genial by nature, he is the man widely acknowledged to
be the world's foremost sports administrator, and yesterday he was
''over here''.
David J Stern is the fourth commissioner of the National Basketball
Association, a post he had held since 1984, Under his leadership, the
NBA has become a model for organised sport as well as a multi-million
dollar marketing enterprise.
A former partner in a New York law firm, Stern is the envy of both
baseball and American football for the way he has steered basketball out
of troubled waters.
He helped to pioneer collective bargaining -- even the lowliest player
in the league's 38 teams earns a minimum $1m a season -- and anti-drug
agreements, as well as creating NBA Properties.
This is the organisation's licensing, marketing, and entertainment
arm, and Stern has played a leading role in the NBA's international goal
and commitment to public service, including the much applauded ''Stay at
School'' programme for young Americans.
Formerly responsible for marketing, broadcasting, and public relations
for the league, Stern was actively involved in the 1983 deal that
established revenue-sharing among teams and created co-operation between
the league and the players.
Although that relationship seemed somewhat fragile at the start of
this season, nevertheless basketball managed to avoid the damaging
months of strikes that baseball went through with a temporary stand-off
agreement between the owners and players, which averted the crisis.
So make no mistake when this suave, silver-haired American puts his
reputation on the line. Something big is afoot, and people listen.
They were listening in London yesterday as Stern outlined plans for
the seventh McDonald's Championships, an event destined to come to
Britain for the first time from October 19-21 and which is sure to have
a big impact on the sport.
It will bring together the best of the American professionals and the
best players under the international (FIBA) banners.
This time the event will feature for the first time the NBA champions,
whoever emerges at the end of their exhaustive system of play-offs in
June, the European champions, and again for the first time, the
Australian and English champions.
There will also be two other national champions from European
countries, to be announced after the European final tour event in
Zaragoza this week.
Stern dropped three big names into the conversation -- Jordan,
Barkley, and Ewing -- all of whom, he said, wanted to come to London.
Stern knows that if Michael Jordan crowns his comeback by leading the
Chigaco Bulls to the NBA title, he could fill two London arenas for
three days in October, and then some.
The NBA is devoting much emphasis to promoting mass participation,
3-on-3 tournaments throughout Europe -- more than 50,000 players were
attracted last year -- and, in October, new ground will be broken when
they come to Glasgow.
Stern predicts a ''quantum leap'' in interest in the sport in Britain
when the McDonald's championship takes place a few days after the
Glasgow event.

WHILE bookmakers in the Granite City have been preoccupied of late
with the plight of the local football side, it is unlikely they would be
too keen to offer a price on Steven Young retaining his Scottish Boys'
title at Royal Aberdeen this week.
The hottest favourite in the event's 60-year history began his quest
for an unprecedented third straight title yesterday with a crushing 9
and 7 win over the luckless Eddie McCluskey of Shotts, a
quarter-finalist last year and a player who had been expected to provide
the champion with a hard opening tie.
However, after Young won eight of the first nine holes -- halving only
the second thanks to his own three putts -- the match was over as a
contest, the end coming two holes later where a conceded par 3 was
enough to bring the curtain down.
A new set-up and slight swing change moulded over the winter have not
affected the Fraserburgh Academy pupil's length from the tee and,
indeed, several of his drives bounded 80 yards past the bewildered
McCluskey, all of which does not augur well for today's opponent, Lee
Bain of Ratho Park.
He can take heart, however. Young has been beaten in this tournament,
although you have to go back to Monday, April 6, 1992 to unearth the 4
and 3 reverse at the hands of Calcot Park's Stuart Spence. It is a
thought obviously in the mind of Bain, who admitted: ''It's a challenge
and will bring out the best in me -- I hope.''
Alongside Young's expected win, his international team-mates from the
Scotland side who won the quadrangular international in Rome last month
also made it over the first hurdle, Grant Campbell (Airdrie), Chris
Kelly (Cawder), and Paul Cunningham (Downfield) not being unduly
stretched.
Elsewhere in the draw, it was a day of mixed emotions for Cowglen's
Mark Loftus The 16-year-old aced the demanding 223-yard third hole with
a majestic No.4-iron, but still went out of the competition, losing on
the final green to Turnhouse's Peter Smith.

BEN Crenshaw has always seemed to have led a charmed golfing life. At
the University of Texas he won three individual national college titles;
when he turned professional he won the qualifying school by 12 strokes;
and not only did he win the first tournament he entered, he was
runner-up in the second.
Crenshaw's career since 1973 has, however, not lived up to
expectations. His second win in the Masters at the Augusta National Club
on Sunday was his nineteenth on the US Tour but, understandably, he was
thought capable of capturing more than two major titles. In the
aftermath of his success he confessed: ''At times I've felt very
capable, but I've never been consistent.''
The catalytic experience for his one-stroke defeat of Davis Love
seems, however, to have been the advice, not quite from the other side
of the grave, which was instrumental in tranforming Crenshaw's recent
moderate fortunes. It came, in fact, from the death bed of Harvey
Penick.
On a visit to Crenshaw's lifetime coach and friend a week before he
died, aged 90, Penick told him: ''Take two practice strokes on the green
and don't allow the putter's clubhead to pass the hands on the stroke.''
It worked, crucially, three times over the last six holes.
At the long fourteenth, Crenshaw holed from 10 feet for a birdie, did
so again at the short sixteenth after having hit a 6 iron to five feet,
and at the next from a 9 iron to 12 feet. Small wonder that Crenshaw
said later: ''I believe that fate dictated this championship, as it has
done so many times here.
''I don't know where I got such confidence in the practice days,'' he
confessed. ''When you reach 43 you know you don't have much chance of
winning a major championship. It was as if I had a fifteenth club in the
bag and that someone this week was putting a hand on my shoulder to
guide me through.''
Even the most sceptical observer was forced to make allowances for
such deeply-felt sentiments. After all, before the tournament, Nick
Faldo was the favourite at 7-1 and Crenshaw no better than 40-1. Yet one
astute commentator wrote: ''He asks to be considered because he's one of
the best putters alive.''
Crenshaw merely said: ''The first part of the week was emotional
because I knew it (Penick's death) was coming. I was able to put that
fact in perspective and, of course, I never need keying up for this
tournament. But no golfer knows it's going to be 'his week'. You just
have to try to put yourself in a position to win.''
Referring to the emotions that visibly overcame him at the moment of
his victory, Crenshaw acknowledged: ''The spectators were wonderfully
supportive, but I had to keep my rhythm and concentration and not let my
feelings show until the tournament was over.''
Love, whose late father also was a protege of Penick, indicated after
his runner-up position was confirmed that he would play in both the
Scottish Open and the Open championship. Despite having had the day's
lowest round of 66, he felt he had started too far back to win in such
powerful and concentrated company.
Greg Norman, again betrayed by one bad shot, his pulled approach to
the seventeenth and the almost inevitable three putts that followed,
summed up his own frustrations: ''You have to do something special to
win here.'' The problem is, he, too, often perpetrates a
self-destructive wound.
The European challenge certainly disappointed, but six victories in
eight years is not exactly a shabby record, and something could be taken
from the survival of seven of the nine professionals and the
qualification for an automatic invitation next year to Colin Montgomerie
and David Gilford, both of whom were among the first 24 to finish.
The idea that, for once, no significant and lasting threat was offered
by the European contingent presaged a heavy defeat by the United States
in September's Ryder Cup match seemed premature and a needless
distraction from Crenshaw's achievement. Anyway, the American side, as
it is taking shape, does not appear all that formidable.

AFTER listening to Ben Crenshaw paying homage to Harvey Penick in the
Butler's Cabin at Augusta, I reached instinctively for the late guru's
hugely successful Little Red Golf Book in an attempt to discover the
secret of the new Masters champion's fine putting display.
Penick devotes all of four pages to putting, which must be a measure
of the importance he attached to this skill, as most of his pearls of
wisdom stretch to just one page or less. His key tip is to take one,
two, or three practice strokes, concentrating hard on each as if it were
the real thing.
''Then,'' he advised, ''put your putter blade down behind the ball,
keep your head and eyes still, and imitate your last practice stroke.
''One great value to this system is that it puts your mind on the
stroke and not on the importance of the putt. Never -- I repeat never --
allow yourself to think about what is riding on the putt, whether it's a
major championship or just a 50 cent wager.''
Crenshaw, mentioned by Penick in his foreword as ''one of the greatest
players of all time, a natural'', may well have followed this advice
with his great putts at the twelfth, thirteenth, sixteenth, and
seventeenth in the final round, but I suspect he forgot to do so with
that tiddler he holed nervously to win at the last.
If he was thinking only about the putt and not ''this one for the
Masters'', Crenshaw would surely have managed to take at least a few
steps away from the hole before dropping his putter, covering his head
with his hands, and bursting into tears.
By coincidence, a take-off of Penick's book called Leslie Nielsen's
Stupid Little Golf Book was published yesterday by HarperCollins.
The author, star of Naked Gun, in conjunction with Henry Beard, a
founder and former editor of National Lampoon, also devotes a passage to
putting.
Unshakeable confidence on the greens, he asserts, comes from sinking
putts and that presents a logistical problem. ''In other words,'' says
Nielsen, ''to putt well, you must already be putting well. To putt well
today, you've got to putt well yesterday, and to putt well tomorrow, you
must putt well today, because by tomorrow, today will be yesterday.''
Everyone clear on that?
One other logistical issue from Augusta last week emanates from Rule
14-3 and arose after Chip Beck's caddie used a device to measure the
direction of fairways and of the wind. This rule banned the use of such
a gizmo during a stipulated round, but as it was used only in practice
there was no problem.
Still, a check in the R &amp; A's Decisions on the Rules of Golf reveals
no fewer than 16 items on such artificial devices and unusual equipment,
outlawing distance meters on golf carts, training aids, plumb lines, and
golf ball warmers.
Golf balls and clubs, curiously, are also illegal if they are used in
peculiar ways. It is not allowed to hold a ball against the grip of a
club if a player thinks the pressure transmitted to the grip through the
ball assists him in making a stroke. It is also against the rule if a
player putts with one hand while using a club in the other to steady
himself.
Binding fingers together with adhesive tape is not on, unless for
medical reasons such as to reduce blisters, but as if to show the rules
have a human side, there is one device that logic tells you should not
be used but the rule says it can.
It is an artificial limb, even if it is an arm with a fitting designed
specially for gripping the club. Just to be safe though -- and it is
hard to imagine this being the case -- committees are given
discretionary powers to ban them if the player is considered to have an
undue advantage over others.
* THAT week-long ordeal, otherwise known as the PGA European Tour
Qualifying School Final, is moving this year after four years at
Montpellier. The event, from November 23-28, will be held at San Roque
and La Quinta in the Andalucian region of southern Spain.
* THE Craigston Rosebowl, a 36-hole open scratch event, due to be
played at Cochrane Castle on April 30, has been re-scheduled for July
23.

IT is as common as heart disease and three times more common than
cancer, yet people sweep it under the carpet, afraid or ashamed to admit
there's a problem. We are talking about mental illness. This morning
250,000 Scots -- 5% of the population -- woke up suffering from major
depression; and three times as many had some depressive symptoms.
At the same time, stress has reached epidemic proportions, and that is
driving people to drink, with more than one-quarter of Scottish men and
8% of women drinking more than the recommended safe limits.
These people -- and it could be you -- are just ordinary folk who are
having difficulty coping with the stresses and strains of modern life.
And the thing is that so much can be done to help; there is no need to
suffer in silence. The newly opened Langside Priory Hospital -- situated
in two adjoining mansion houses in Glasgow's South Side -- provides a
haven of peace, tranquillity, and top quality care to help people to
pick up the pieces.
The newest hospital in the Priory Hospitals Group -- the leading
provider of private acute psychiatric care in the UK -- Langside Priory
specialises in emotional, psychological or psychiatric problems and is
the only private acute psychiatric hospital north of the Border.
There are 20 in-patient beds -- all patients have their own room with
bathroom en-suite -- and a day hospital. With modern approaches to
treatment many patients can be helped without the need to stay in
hospital and where appropriate attend day hospital programmes. There are
pleasant rooms for group therapies and activities as well as a gym to
encourage physical health. The emphasis is on individual care, and
encouraging patients to help themselves forms an important part of the
treatment plan.
''We treat the whole range of acute psychiatric illnesses,'' said
hospital director Ian Rodger. ''Depression is a major public health
problem, and obviously if it is serious it can be life threatening and
disabling. A BMA survey last year revealed that the majority of doctors
felt people were more stressed than 15 years ago and were drinking more
to cope.
''The biggest stress is work related, whether too much stress at work
or just not having a job. Stress can lead to depression which, if it
isn't dealt with, can lead to alcohol abuse. Conversely, some people
become depressed because of excessive alcohol consumption.
''It's a big concern to both patient and the family and the message is
that help, effective help, is available.''
The pedigree of the professional team at Langside is first class. The
doctors, nurses, and therapists have been working together for the past
two years at the Priory Suite which was an independent unit within Bon
Secours Hospital, and have a wide range of qualifications and
complementary skills and experience. The new hospital replaces the
eight-bedded Priory Suite which was found to be insufficient to meet the
demand for private psychiatric care.
Specifically, the hospital offers treatment programmes for depression,
stress, anxiety, eating disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorder as
well as alcohol-related problems, one of the sad realities of Scottish
life. The hospital offers detoxification and either an in-patient or day
patient intensive 28-day programme of counselling, education, and group
therapy.
''A lot of people drink more than is good for them,'' said Ian Rodger.
''Not everyone who drinks has got an alcohol problem but many people
can't cut down which can lead to physical, social, work, and family
crises. The only way forward is actually to give up drinking, and the
programme we have here is based on a goal of sobriety.
''Most problem drinkers on the alcohol treatment programme have
stopped drinking many times before but have been unable to maintain
sobriety. The treatment helps them to address the change of attitude and
gain the self-esteem required to live contentedly without the need for
alcohol. Free weekly aftercare groups for both ex-patients and families
help in the process of developing positive lifestyles on the foundations
laid in treatment.''
And the good news is that about 80% of the patients treated over the
past two years have remained sober and have greatly improved the quality
of their lives and those of their families.
Family therapy may also form an important part of the management of
eating disorders. Anorexia and bulimia is increasing and Langside Priory
offers the necessary specialist help.
A survey by the Eating Disorders Association has shown that 38% of
their members had been treated privately, either because of the lack of
availability in the NHS or the lack of accessibility. Treatment at
Langside may be as an out-patient or an in-patient depending on the
seriousness of the condition. Sufferers should seek help sooner rather
than later and Langside Priory Hospital will give advice as to the best
course of action.
The Priory Hospitals Group, which has 600 acute psychiatric beds in 16
locations across the country, was founded in 1980. Recognised by the
relevant professional bodies -- for example the Royal College of
Psychiatrists and the Royal College of General Practitioners -- the
group trains psychiatric registrars, nurses, social workers, and medical
students.
''People are surprised at our pedigree and also that we are putting
something back into the community. Last year the Priory Hospitals Group
spent #750,000 on research and training for the NHS,'' said Jacqui
Rooney, marketing manager.
Langside Priory is recognised by the leading health insurers and
provident associations. However, many patients are self-payers. As Ian
Rodger points out: ''A person with a serious drink problem often spends
thousands of pounds on alcohol in a year. They can quickly finance their
treatment from the savings they make from their sobriety. For some
people it is literally the price of life.''
The Langside Priory management team consists of Ian Rodger, hospital
director; Alan Fagan, clinical services director; Jacqui Rooney,
marketing manager; Graham Campbell, accounts manager; Andrea Hutcheson,
administrative services manager; Phyllis Gartshore, alcohol programme
co-ordinator.

FARMERS working land currently owned by British Coal are stepping up
their campaign to ensure that the properties are sold at ''realistic
values''.
They are challenging Michael Heseltine and his Department of Trade and
Industry to step in and prevent tenants being given minimum time within
which to negotiate the sale of the land that they have farmed for years.
At a meeting in Fife on Thursday representatives of the 40-plus
tenants in Scotland will discuss the next stages of their plan of
campaign.
David Scobbie, from Tillicoultry, said: ''We feel we are still being
steamrollered by British Coal .
''The imposition of a short time limit for BC's offer of sale means
that tenants are negotiating under duress. Some ridiculous valuations
have been suggested to tenants who would want to purchase and tenants
have not been advised on the full terms and conditions upon which sales
will proceed. How can you can to a bank manager and negotiate like that.
''The prices being asked are above curent open market values in
Scotland and we have made it clear to British Coal that we will ask for
Ministerial intervention to deal with tenants in a fair and reasonable
way.''
Scottish Farmers Union legal adviser Ian Melrose said: ''We are very
concerned about the duress that tenants are being subjected to and
Ministers must be prepared to guarantee that British Coal offers a fair
deal.
''We are preparing further representations at the highest levels.''
British Coal said they would consider complaints but would continue to
make efforts to sell land and properties with as little delay as
possible.

A trio of Scottish farmers have renewed their attack on the British
Wool Marketing Board for preventing a merchant purchasing wool via a
Portugese group.
Last week the BWMB introduced a prescriptive resolution which would
prevent any company acting as agents for a foreign buyer of wool from
producers if some of that buyer's customers are in the UK.
All UK wool sales are controlled through the board's buying scheme.
One of the opponents of this move, Alex Murray, Aberfeldy, said: ''If
the board knew they were going to take this action why did they waste
money in an earlier action. I do not want to see the board destroyed but
it must come out into the open and accept free trading.''
Col HLR MacNeal, Argyll, said:''The wool board needs competition and
when they get it they move goal posts.''
Another Argyll farmer, Jamie Mellor, said:''As farmers we should have
the right to choose who we sell our clip to.''
The action that prevents J&amp;W Greig purchasing wool on behalf of
Brintons Portugal was, he said, typical of system which ignored the
quality wool market.
''If the Wool Board had any sense they would address the needs of
their major customers, of which Brintons is clearly one, and recognise
that by bringing added value to the basic wool product they could
increase our revenues for producing quality wool product.''

SIGNET, the former Ratners jewellery chain has come out fighting
against a proposal from certain Preference shareholders to break up the
group and sell off its component parts, which will now be put to the
vote on May 5.
''We strongly believe that this proposal makes absolutely no sense for
shareholders,'' declares chairman James McAdam. ''Putting the businesses
into a highly public three month forced sale is certainly not the way to
realise their full value.''
A disgruntled group of US Preference shareholders has requisitioned
Signet to call a meeting of shareholders to propose that the group be
sold off within three months. Signet pointed out that the shareholders
concerned have just 1.2% of the votes and is evidently mystifed at their
motives.
The group is struggling to recover from heavy debts derived from the
Ratner era and Preference shareholders have not received a dividend
since 1992, with arrears totalling #100m. Debt now amounts to #360m.
Despite its travails, Signet is the biggest jewellery retailer in the
world, with a fifth of the UK market under the H. Samuel and Ernest
Jones formats. The Sterling subsidiary is the second biggest US business
in its field.
The new management team is concentrating in the UK on improving
marketing, developing new product ranges, modernising stores, improving
distribution and increasing training. Mr McAdam says the business is now
showing the benefits of the recovery programme. Trading profits of #16m
are estimated for the year to last January, up from losses of #1.5m.
In Sterling action is being taken to achieve savings in costs and
working capital; the advantages of centralised credit systems are
flowing through; and opportunities to improve performance have been
identified. However higher interest rates and increased competition are
likely to trim trading profits from #40m to #30m. The group as a whole
should make #8m pre-tax, up from #1.7m before exceptionals.
Mr McAdam says the board remains committed to some form of financial
reconstruction ''at the right time and on the right terms, provided that
it is in the interests of all classes of shareholder.''
It is not thought appropriate to give a firm timetable on this as it
depends on the trading performance and external economic factors. Mr
McAdam points out that the value to shareholders of any reconstruction
is dependent on the perceived underlying worth and profitability of
Signet's businesses.
''It is in the best interests of all shareholders to back management
as it continues to improve operating performance, so that opportunites
for reconstruction can be pursued from a position of greater strength.''
Meanwhile the group is in the middle of negotiating with its banks to
renew its bank facilities which are due to expire at the end of June.

SCOTLAND remains relatively new territory for roadworks by
construction group Amey but it has high hopes after winning its first
Scottish road contract, worth #28m from the Department of Transport for
the A1 Tranent. It has worked in the past with the Ministry of Defence
in Scotland.
Amey prides itself on being one of the UK's leading road contractors,
specialising in repair and maintenance. It already is in charge of the
upkeep of all the motorways and trunk roads around west London and
Leeds.
Its repair and maintenance capability, which accounts for half its
roads turnover, means that it is less exposed to the downturn in
government's roadbuilding programme. Amey's executive chairman Neil
Ashley believes that the government has no option but to maintain the
existing road stock unless ''we are going to become a third world
pothole economy''.
However in an attempt to reduce the cyclicality of the business, Amey
has been steadily building up a facilities management business covering
not just roads but a wide variety of services such as council leisure
facilities and more recently, a small housebuilding operation in south
east England.
Last year, its first as a public company, Amey reported a #3m increase
in taxable profits to #5.1m on turnover of #220m. Although mainstream
building activity was weak and the business made a small loss this was
more than offset by strong performance from facilities management.
Since its formation in 1991, Amey Facilities Management's (AFM)
activities have grown by over 100% each year. Turnover of fees and work
costs in 1994 was #22m, with the fee turnover increasing by 225% and
profit by 241%.
Last year, AFM secured its first major contract for a local authority
worth #60m over three years, from the London Borough of Brent, to manage
58,000 houses and 80 school buildings.
In the last few weeks the company has been awarded a contract with
Portsmouth City Council worth #75m over five years and remains on the
lookout for further local authority contracts particularly in Scotland.
Amey is keen to add bolt-on acquisitions to the business to increase
its critical mass and improve the quality of its earnings. To that end
it is interested in taking over the repair and maintenance of British
Rail's track and infrastucture which is currently in the process of
being privatised.
Trading in the current financial year has got off to a good start with
a further #140m of orders booked on top of the record #242m of work in
hand at the end of last year.
Amey shares remained at 148p where they yield 3.8%, given the total
dividend of 4.5p after a final shareholders' payment of 3.0p.

<HEADLINE>Nicosia blow for Asil Nadir in  Polly Peck tussle</HEADLINE>

FUGITIVE tycoon Asil Nadir suffered a blow yesterday when a Turkish
Cypriot court decided administrators have the right to access to the
subsidiaries of the collapsed Polly Peck International in North Cyprus.
Nicosia full court judge Talat Refiker, in the final session of the
case brought against the administrators by Nadir, decided that the
administration order granted in Britain in 1990 need not be registered
in North Cyprus.
The order paves the way for the PPI administrators to act in North
Cyprus as adminstrators in connection with the subsidiaries of PPI.
The PPI assests in North Cyprus -- two hotels, a citrus extraction,
cardboard packing plant and a construction company -- have so far
remained out of any settlement due to court cases against their change
of ownership.
''We have very strong legal grounds for appeal and we shall file
immediately,'' said Ali Riza Gorgun, legal advisor and co-ordinatior of
Nadir, in Nicosia.
The case was filed by Nadir's lawyers in 1993, based on the argument
that Britain does not recognise the breakaway Turkish Republic of North
Cyprus. The Turkish Cypriot state is only recognised by Ankara.
The court also dismissed the previous injuction barring the
administrators from acting in North Cyprus and ordered Nadir and his
lawyers to pay all costs of defendants.
Nadir's lawyer Ergin Ulunay asked the court to keep the previous
injuction in force until they file an appeal.
The court has given them seven days to appeal, during which time the
injuction order will be in force and automatically lifted at the end of
seven days.
Lawyer Ismet Izer, representing the administrators, saids: ''Justice
is done. We have all along maintained our position which has now been
ratified by the honourable court.''
Administrators later welcomed the court's decision. They said the move
vindicated them in an often life-threatening task to win control of Asil
Nadir's former business empire.
Administrator Chris Barlow said the decision meant they could now sell
Polly Peck's assets in North Cyprus.
''It is in fact a vindication of our views as administrators for
four-and-a-half years that we should pursue these matters through the
courts in a proper manner, which we've done with diligence, and it's
produced a result which I believe is just,'' he said.
Mr Barlow said administrators had to be accompanied by bodyguards when
working in Turkey and Northern Cyprus because of violent attacks linked
to their efforts to sort out Polly Peck, which collapsed in 1990, and to
sell its businesses.
In the four worst incidents since 1994, an employee of Coopers and
Lybrand accountancy firm, where the administrators work, was beaten up
in Istanbul, a consultant for Coopers was shot and wounded, a lawyer's
car in Northern Cyrpus was set on fire and a bank was bombed, Barlow
said.
Mr Barlow said the court judgment, unless later overturned on appeal,
would allow administrators to sell the Crystal Cove Hotel in Northern
Cyprus and several pieces of land.

BRITISH Polythene Industries, which indicated it had money to spend
when it announced 1994 results last month, has so far proved as good as
its word.
The Greenock-based group yesterday announced the #1.1m cash
acquisition of Norwich-based Polycon Packaging (East Anglia) -- its
third purchase within a month.
It plans capital expenditure of about #18m in 1995 and finance
director John Langlands reiterated British Polythene's selective
acquisition strategy.
British Polythene, by far the biggest manufacturer of polythene
products in the UK, continues to talk to a number of potential targets
of different sizes and expects to make several more acquisitions this
year.
In addition to the #1.1m purchase price of Polycon, British Polythene
will assume borrowings of #1.2m as a result of the acquisition.
In 1994, Polycon, which employs about 60 people and will continue to
operate from its Norwich base, made sales of #7.2m and pre-tax profits
of #155,214. At December 31, it had net assets of #647,583.
Mr Langlands said British Polythene's latest addition brought it
closer to the ''end-user customer''.
Polycon sells industrial film and shrinkwrap, silage bags, sheet and
stretchwrap direct to about 1800 customers.
Mr Langlands said: ''The company has the ability to service small
orders which we perhaps don't have throughout the rest of the group.''
Last month, British Polythene announced it was paying IR#900,000 for
the business and some of the trading assets of Irish company Globophan
Industries, which specialises in flexible packaging for the retail and
commercial sectors.
Earlier the same week, it announced a #2m investment in a Dumfries
factory which will recycle waste polythene from farms.

SCOTLAND'S Companies House is moving for only the second time this
century.
From April 18, the Department of Trade and Industry agency's Edinburgh
office, which is responsible for incorporating companies, registering
documents and making this information available to business-people and
the general public, will operate out of Castle Terrace.
With continuity essential to an office which registers about 7000
companies annually and which last year carried out 135,000 company
searches for customers, the move is a matter of necessity.
The lease on Companies House's George Street premises is due to expire
and the landlord wishes to redevelop the building.
Companies House is moving into 200,000 sq ft premises at 37 Castle
Terrace, which it will share with other Government offices including the
Benefits Agency and Employment Service.
Jim Henderson, Registrar of Companies for Scotland, said: ''The new
office will be only the third occupied by the Registrar of Companies
this century.
Companies House's new telephone number, from next Tuesday, will be
0131-535-5800. The postcode is EH1 2EB.

GLASGOW-based Murray Johnstone has invested another #500,000 in the
expanding Slotz Vending, which has an operation in Cumbernauld.
The investment, made through the group's Murray Johnstone Private
Equity venture capital division, helped the firm complete the
acquisition of Bury-based Select-a-Cup.
Total expansion finance of #1.4m, with a further #100,000 having been
invested by management and #800,000 of senior debt coming from Bank of
Scotland, will also allow the vending machine services business to
complete another purchase in Yorkshire.
Slotz Vending, which was set up by a team of former senior executives
of Yorkshire-based quoted photocopier group Eurocopy, has ambitious
expansion plans.
Murray Johnstone, whose latest investment lifts its equity stake to
#1.2m, would like to see it making further purchases north of the
Border. Slotz's management has now put in #200,000 of its own money.
In November last year, shortly after the company was formed, Murray
Johnstone provided development capital of #700,000.

GLASGOW-based Weir Group yesterday announced a $4.2m (#2.6m) purchase
which further strengthens its rapidly expanding valve operations.
The engineering group, which has now made five valve acquisitions in
the last seven years, wants to double the size of this side of its
business between now and the end of the century.
Weir believes the bolt-on purchase of C&amp;S Valves, which is based near
Chicago, will complement and broaden the activities of its other US
valve-maker, Atwood and Morrill of Massachusetts.
Since Weir re-entered this market seven years ago, turnover from valve
operations has grown from zero to #60m and now accounts for about 10% of
total group sales.
In terms of size, valve activities and mechanical handling, which also
contributes about 10% of total sales, are second only to the group's
pump operations, which account for 55%.
Weir Group managing director Sir Ron Garrick said: ''We get immediate
synergy from this merger by our ability to increase C&amp;S's worldwide
sales through our international network.''
With C&amp;S deriving more than half of its business from the power
market, Weir will be looking to promote its latest addition in the
Pacific Rim.

HELPED partly by the success of films 'Four Weddings and a Funeral'
and 'Strictly Ballroom' which have boosted interest in formal attire,
profits of menswear group Moss Bros have bounded 81% from #4.08m to
#7.4m before tax in the year to January 28, 1995.
Shareholders are to receive a 71% boost in their dividend to 12p via a
9p final as part of the celebration of profits which are the highest
ever recorded by the company. Turnover was up 14.4% at #71.1m, or 11.3%
ahead on a like-for-like basis.
Moss, which takes in The Savoy Taylor Guild, The Suit Company and
Cecil Gee, is able to report that despite heavy competition in the high
street, the results have been achieved without any reduction in its
gross profit margins. Costs of operation rose by #2.3m over the previous
year's level, mostly made up of a combination of increased running costs
of branches opened during the year, together with general increases in
line with the level of inflation.
The rest is attributable to performance related pay. In the market,
the figures both surprised and pleased with the shares jumping 35p to
384p.
The company is benefiting from a trend that has been noticeable
amongst other men's retailers, a fashion move back towards suits,
particularly single breasted and three or four buttons on the jacket. As
the group's managing director Rowland Gee remarked, ''Grunge is dead.
Suits are in.''
Analysts described the resuls as sparkling, stating that higher
margins and tight control of costs were the key areas. The current year
has also started well with sales on a like-for-like basis running some
9% ahead.
Moss opened 11 shops last year and another five have been acquired
since the year end. It is also continuing its programme of the
development and refurbishment of all shops as necessary.
Chairman Neil Benson says the company plans to continue to develop and
build upon its established strengths. ''We trade under a range of high
profile brands but we are not yet represented in all the locations
wehere we would like to see one of our shops. We have the financial,
managerial and systemic strengths to improve our coverage of the country
and we will continue our expansion plans subject only to achieving
realistic occupancy costs.''

HIGH Street retail sales volumes have fallen for the second month in a
row and the underlying three month trend is also down, according to the
March Distributive Trades Survey from the Confederation of British
Industry.
The decline in the underlying trend is the first since January 1993
following a slowdown in February. The CBI's February findings, released
last month, proved though to be in stark contrast to the official retail
sales for the month which showed a bounce back after January's sharp
fall. However, the monthly data were volatile because of the timing the
holidays. And the underlying trend pointed to a significant slowing in
spending, hit by tax increases and higher interest rates.
The official retail sales for March are due on Friday week but,
meanwhile, the CBI survey shows that annual sales volumes for March fell
at the same rate as reported in February -- although a smaller reduction
had been expected.
Sales were seen as well below average following the third consecutive
month of unfulfilled sales growth expectations. Orders placed on
suppliers fell slightly -- also for the third consecutive month -- as
stocks remained more than adequate in relation to expected demand.
Retail sales volumes are expected to grow in April as retailers look
forward to Easter. However, the monthly trend in high street trade has
proved difficult to anticipate over the past year. Sales for the time of
year are expected to remain below average although by less than in
February and March.
In April, the growth in orders placed on suppliers is expected to rise
for the first time since last November although stocks are projected to
remain excessive in relation to expected demand.
Alastair Eperon, Chairman of the CBI's Distributive Trades Survey
Panel commenting on the March outcome, said, ''This latest fall in sales
volumes confirms the slowdown in the underlying growth of high street
trade indiciated by the survey in recent months. Although trading
conditions have been difficult to anticipate over the past year, the
reduction in sales in March was perhaps unsurprising following the first
expected decline by retailers since December 1992. Firms saw trade as
remaining well below average for the time of year.''
Looking at the motor traders, sales volumes are shown to have fallen
for the third successive month. However, the latest decline at minus 24%
was substantially greater than in the preceding two months and the
largest since last October (minus 31%). The reduction was despite
expectations of flat year-on-year business levels.
The overall reduction disguises the fact that while vehicle traders
saw a sharp decline in sales, parts and accessories traders enjoyed a
substantial rise in business. Sales, overall, are expected to fall in
April although by less than in March.

PROBLEMS caused by taking on too much new work at once in a small
kitchen at the JFK airport in New York was the only blight on Alpha
Airports Group's record in its first full year as a public company.
That cost about #400,000 to leave the pre-tax total ahead by 11.5% to
#21.4m on overall turnover 12.6% greater at #477m.
Otherwise the former Forte subsidiary, there is a residual 24.8%
stake, has moved a further step towards its target of being the world's
most profitable airports group.
Chief executive Paul Harrison sais that he is on the lookout for
acquisitions outside the catering and retail operations. These could
include anything from baggage handling to de-icing in what is a highly
fragmented industry and where Alpha starts off in the happy position of
being a known international operator on convential fight catering and
retailing.
Advantages include all the necessary permissions for ''airside'' such
as security and where competition is much less intense than in what are
currently its core businesses.
With debt of just #17m as at end January and a near halving in the
capital expenditure programme to about #10m this year, financing any
deal would not be a problem. Joint ventures would appear to be one
attractive solution.
Last year saw faster growth in charter than scheduled airline business
with margins pressure more than offset by productivity gains.
Some airlines continued to reduce their in-flight catering although
volume was helped by the gaining of new contracts as well as the renewal
of important connections such as Lufthansa for four years from Heathrow.
But turnover was less than 5% higher at #220m.
Landside retailing benefited from the increase in passenger numbers at
UK airports and sales rose 20% to #256m. Some 12% came from a management
contract for the Gatwick North Terminal worth #500,000 to handle
duty-free sales. If the concession does disappear in 1999 as is
possible, Alpha would lose #140m of sales with margins of 3.4% which
would not be a significant profits dent for a company which should by
then have made significant advances through expansion.
Profits this year should reach #25m without difficulty to leave the
shares at 138p trading at 12 times earnings. Advantage should be taken
of yesterday's 7p setback to build up holdings.
The dividend total is 4.6p for a 4.2% yield.

<HEADLINE>Base rate rise is on the cards in May.  Factory gate prices fuel inflation fears</HEADLINE>

THE continuing pickup in factory gate price inflation offers no
comfort to those hoping that further base rate rises can be postponed or
even avoided altogether.
Evidence of a slowdown in manufacturing output and retail sales in
recent months has boosted hopes that the three half-point increases in
rates since September and the extra taxes heaped on the British public
would avert an upsurge in inflationary pressures.
The biggest danger is at the factory gate. Sharp increase in input
prices, the materials and fuel costs of manufacturers, are feeding
through to output prices. Manufacturers are also bidding to expand their
margins. The full effect is yet to be seen in the shops, but some at
least of it will feed through to retail prices.
Factory gate prices increased by 0.4% last month, taking the annual
rate up from 3.6% to 3.8%. In the seasonally adjusted index, which
excludes the food, drink, tobacco, and petroleum industries, the monthly
rise was 0.3%, and the annual rate rose from 3.7% to 3.9%.
Over the latest three months the annualised rate of increase in the
seasonally adjusted index was 5.1%. Back in October both the headline
and the seasonally adjusted indices were sporting year-on-year rises of
just 2.3%.
Clearly there has been a rapid deterioration over the last six months,
and a further acceleration in factory gate price inflation is on the
cards.
If the price expectations indicated in CBI surveys are taken at face
value the figure could exceed 7%. This is probably unduly gloomy.
Economists at Goldman Sachs are forecasting factory gate price inflation
of 4.5% by mid-year.
The only comfort to be found in yesterday's figures was that the
seasonally adjust index gained 0.3% for the second month in a row, a
slightly lower rate than in the previous five months.
Part of the explanation lies in the upsurge in input prices. Commodity
prices have gone through the roof as the recovery from recession has
developed global proportions, and sterling's weakness has boosted import
prices.
The worst could be over on this front. Seasonally adjusted input
prices rose by 0.4% between February and March, but the annual rate
edged down from 11.2% to 11% after apparently peaking at 12.1% in
January.
James Capel's Adam Cole is left in no doubt that another rise in
interest rates is needed next month. The Governor of the Bank of England
and the Chancellor of the Exchequer next meet on the day after the local
elections in England and Wales.
''The factory gate price inflation data confirm that manufacturing
price pressures are increasing as sectoral capacity constraints begin to
bite.
''With survey evidence -- such as that from the CBI -- pointing to a
further acceleration in inflation over the coming months, sterling's
recent weakness is a cause for concern and argues strongly for a further
rise in base rates.''
He regards any slowdown in manufacturing output as no more than a
pause for breath, and makes the point that the 4% fall in the pound's
trade weighted index so far this year represents an easing of policy,
which benefits the manufactured and traded goods sectors.
The disappointing producer prices data hit the stock market and at one
point the FTSE-100 share index was over 20 points lower at 3189.7, but
Wall Street kept its nerve and the Footsie confined its losses to just
6.7 points
and closed at 3204.2, the third night in a row it has been above 3200.

EUROTUNNEL shares were never for widows and orphans. UK holders have
been gradually selling out to the French, who now have about two-thirds
of the equity. Small shareholders predominate on both sides of the
Channel.
Eurotunnel's joint chairmen, Sir Alastair Morton and Partick Ponsolle,
gave the market a nasty jolt yesterday by spelling out more starkly than
ever before that this was sink or swim year for the debt-laden Channel
Tunnel operator.
The shares lost another 24p to 218p and were at one point quoted as
low as 207p. They were issued at 350p in December 1987, two months after
Black Monday, and within three years had nearly doubled. Since then
delays, cost overruns, and finally weaker than expected revenues have
taken their toll.
Even if Eurotunnel wins its war with the ferry companies there will be
no dividends until next century. That is the best that can be hoped for.
Eurotunnel is weighed under with #8000m of debt and equity of just
#2170m (after two rights issues). The banks have stuck by the company
through thick and thin and will do everything possible to prevent it
going under.
One possible starting point for a third rescue package would be a swap
of debt for equity to reduce crippling finance charges. Effectively that
would reduce the interest of the existing shareholders in the ailing
company. But there may be no alternative.

THE dollar disappeared off trading screens in Tokyo overnight. At one
point it was quoted at 80.15 yen, having closed at 83.70 in New York on
Friday.
The Bank of Japan managed to drag it back up towards 83 yen, and it
made higher ground in European and North American trading later.
But the feature of currency trading was a relapse in the German mark
with the dollar back above DM1.40. This was the first time that the yen
and the mark had been moving in opposite directions.
Though the dollar/mark rate is the one which features in European
centres, the real pacesetter in global markets is the yen.
The Bank of Japan has been slow to come up with a cut in the official
discount rate, and the Japanese Government has still to produce a
reflationary package to compensate for the yen's 20% advance on the
dollar this year and the Kobe earthquake back in January.
The huge shortfall in trade with Japan is at the heart of the US's
colossal trade deficit, and yen are needed to fund America's budget
deficit.
The eclipse of the mark yesterday, perhaps no more than a temporary
phenomenon in exceptionally volatile global currency markets, helped
sterling.
It managed a gain of around three pfennigs to DM2.2463, but lost over
three-quarters of a cent to $1.5956. The trade weighted index recovered
from 84.3 to 84.5. The pound's weakness, nevertheless, remains a serious
problem.

FOR a chap who has been blowing his own trumpet since he was 13, Iain
Muirhead is quite modest. He also has the humility to realise that even
as Prinicipal Trumpet with Scottish Opera he needs to keep polishing his
technique, and consequently tries to devote at least two hours a day to
practising at home.
''I get teased in the business about the amount of practising I do,''
he says. ''But technique, and developing sound and stamina, are
important.''
It emerges that Iain Muirhead has a demanding lifestyle. He works in a
small world of professional musicians, who tend to know each other, and
one's standard of play has to be good. ''You can't afford off-days,''
says Iain. ''Everyone would know about it. It wouldn't need to happen
too often.''
He started playing the trumpet while at St Mungo's Academy in Glasgow,
where he was fortunate in having an ex-principal trumpet for the
Scottish National Orchestra as his music teacher. He went into the Civil
Service on leaving school in 1972 but took a chance and left on being
offered freelance work with the SNO three years later.
A freelance career developed, and he meanwhile studied class and
instrumental music teaching at Jordanhill College. He also took lessons
in the trumpet from David James, principal trumpet of the BBC SSO, and
went to the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama for a year and a
half to further his studies. He was getting so much freelance work by
this time, however, that he had to choose between studies and working,
and he opted for the latter.
He was playing regularly with the SNO, Scottish Ballet, and Scottish
Opera and accompanying them to countries such as Italy, Japan, Finland,
France, and Canada, Poland, Germany, and Spain.
His work was becoming known and five years ago he became principal
trumpet with Scottish Opera.
When his services are not required by the orchestra, he plays
occasionally with the SNO, BBC SSO, the SCO, the Paragon Ensemble, and
the new Scottish Bach Ensemble. He also does session work and you will
have heard him playing any time you watch Scottish Television news
programmes: he recorded the theme tune. He also teaches at the RSAMD and
is a founder member of the Cornet and Trumpet Society.
Iain Muirhead's job involves a great deal of responsibility: a lot of
thought goes into hiring freelance players, and selecting particular
players for particular works.
Qualifications, he says, matter less than a person's ability to play
an instrument, and to fit in with the rest of the orchestra. But that's
the way it has always been in the music business. As Iain says, ''You're
only as good as your last performance''.

In reply to last week's look into the future, The Skallie recalls
happier days when the Lochgelly held sway
DID you read that fiendish mumbo-jumbo the other week from Barclay
McBain about education in the year 2020? Pupils defaulting on their
meta-cognitive quotients. Dysfunctioning families which are
epistemologically disadvantaged. Learning via the family info-net.
The heidies -- have you ever met one with 2020 vision, anyhow? -- who
hearkened to this balderdash at the same conference as the ageing but
still sprightly McBain, had been given galactic lift-off from their
schools to get away from the pressures of ''creeping incrementalism''.
Crapping excrementalism, more like.
The Skallie didn't get where he is today by indulging in whimsical
zooming beyond the millenium. Che sera sera, as good old Doris Day used
to belt out. Now there's a woman. She would have had Princess Leia
Organa defaulting on her meta-cognitive quotients any time.
The year 2020? That's a hoot! The same heidies that were taking this
trip to the moon on gossamer wings -- most of them are wired to it,
anyway -- haven't a clue how many of their brats will dog school the
first day back.
Nineteen hundred and twenty is where our Tardis should be headed.
Dominies were dominies, brats showed proper respect and parents never
ventured closer to the school than the ale-house across the road. Now?
Prithee, lend an ear to this venerable mate of The Skallie, knackered
after a so-called ''interactive'' session with some of the nation's
future leaders.
''Gone at last, the buggers. Thank God for the bell . . . You used to
teach them. Now they do their own thing -- folios, or investigations, or
horse-droppings like that. And, as the ditty goes, they've got more
rabbit than Sainsbury's!
''I used to give them what with the Lochgelly. Now it's referral. You
have to send them to jumped-up guidance teachers -- who used to be
delinquents themselves -- for counselling. Counselling! The Bar-L, it
should be!
''The cheek of them! I gave this one laldy for his spelling. 'No
wonder my spelling's a bollocks,' says he, 'when ginks like you drone on
about the three Rs. Two of them don't even start with an R. Is it any
wonder I'm disinterested in spelling?'
''Your vocabulary's even worse than your spelling,'' I told him.
''Don't you know the difference between uninterested and
disinterested?'' 'No,' said he, 'I don't know and I'm disinterested. In
fact, I don't give an effing toss.'
''I was trying to teach another one grammar. I asked him if it was
'Pull me out of the quicksand or I will get sucked in' or 'Pull me out
of the quicksand or I shall get sucked in'. You'll never credit his
answer! 'Pull me out of the quicksand before I get sucked in, and stop
farting about.'
''I blame it on this comprehensive lark. Mixed ability -- that's the
sewage that's giving education a pong! Einstein and Vinnie Jones don't
mix. The tortoise only catches up if the hare has a cat-nap.
''I went to the head master to complain, but you can never find him.
When he's not on his space travels, he's traipsing around the school.
Management by walking about, he calls it. In ever decreasing circles, I
bet! He claims his shoe leather is more effective than my old Lochgelly!
''You know the final insult? I told him the leaving age should be
reduced to 12 to get rid of the no-goods. He suggested I take early
retirement and go into politics. Said I had the perfect credentials for
the next minister for education!''
Society is crumbling. In The Skallie's time, dominies instilled
respect for royalty. Now technology is even used to mock our beloved
royal family. This advert on TV shows a princess holding a phone in
silence, and on the other half of the screen an exasperated-looking man.
He says: ''I know there's somebody there. I can hear breathing. This
is silly . . . It's been going on for months . . . Is that you, Cheeky
Chops? . . . What do you want, for God's sake?''
Alongside the princess appears the face of that actor with the
devilish grin -- Bob Hoskins. He says: ''It's good not to talk.''
The Skallie may be old-fashioned, but technology which can tear away
the fabric of a princess cannot be trusted with the education of our
children. Internet, video conferencing and the rest should be confined
to the wastebasket of history.
If inter-galactic pupil exchanges become the close encounters of the
2020th kind, our little visitor to Planet Earth will need a mere glance
at what we have done to education before beaming out his desolate
message -- ''ET . . . come . . . home.'' Unless, of course, we have
beamed out an earlier one of our own: ''Educational technology (ET) . .
. go . . . away.''

A PRODUCER of precision-moulded plastics for the electronics and
vehicle industries is to create more than 100 jobs in Glenrothes, it was
announced yesterday. The project involves setting up a #1.5m plant.
Birkbys Plastics Ltd, based in Yorkshire, has been supplying a number
of key companies in Scotland and says it wants to pursue new business
opportunities.
The company is part of the Marubeni Corporation, one of the leading
trading companies in Japan, and will supply companies throughout
Scotland, including Sun Microsystems, from a 40,000sq ft factory on the
town's Westwood Park industrial estate.
The work will include product design, injection moulding, painting,
printing, and assembly.
The company was assisted by the Invest in Fife partnership and Locate
in Scotland, the joint Scottish Office and Scottish Enterprise inward
investment agency.
Mr George Kynoch, Scottish Industry Minister, said the decision would
help reinforce Scotland's position as a world-class centre of excellence
in the electronics and telecommunications industries.
Mr Robert MacKenzie, chief executive of Fife Enterprise, said he felt
Fife's position in central Scotland was an ideal location, with a highly
skilled workforce on tap, and looked forward to seeing the company
progress.

Gaza City, Monday
PALESTINIAN police rounded up 150 Muslim militants today after two
suicide bombings killed eight people, seven of them Israelis, in Gaza.
The death toll rose after a soldier died from wounds sustained in one
of the attacks. Most of the victims were soldiers, including a woman,
and another female victim was a 20-year-old American student.
The attacks led to new calls from Israeli leaders for Arafat to disarm
Islamic militants in the PLO-run Gaza Strip.
However a leader of the militant fundamentalist group Hamas, which
claimed responsibility for the second attack, warned that Arafat was
risking provoking all-out conflict in Gaza.
''We will not be the first to start the civil war, but do you expect
that people will not defend themselves? He will face a popular
uprising,'' said Mahmud Zahar.
Israel today barred Palestinians from a six-mile stretch of Gaza's
main north-south road between Kfar Darom and Netzarim Jewish
settlements, site of yesterday's attacks by the militant Hamas and
Islamic Jihad groups.
Security forces also closed two east-west roads linking the
settlements with Israel.
Palestinian police detained about 150 suspected sympathisers of the
militant Muslim groups. In the south of the Gaza Strip, police exchanged
fire with Hamas gunmen before arresting two of them.
A Gaza military court today sentenced Islamic Jihad's Samir Ali
al-Jedi to 15 years in jail for training children as young as 10 to be
guerrillas.
PLO chairman Yasser Arafat set up the three-man tribunal in response
to calls by Israel and the United States for action against Islamic
militants after previous attacks. It was the first time the tribunal had
sent anyone to jail.
A PLO official said that an Islamic Jihad spokesman, detained since a
previous bombing in January, would also go on trial soon.
Arafat, treading a thin line between preserving the peace accord and
avoiding confrontation with militants, had ordered arrests before, but
there had been no trials and most of those detained were freed.
In a direct challenge to Arafat today, militant supporters fired
rounds of automatic gunfire into the air at a wake in salute to a
24-year-old suicide bomber, Khaled Khatib.
''Let Arafat know that we will not give up and his arrests will not
terrorise us,'' one militant shouted.
Israel has repeatedly warned the Palestinian self-rule authority that
it will not move to further stages of the 1993 PLO-Israel peace deal if
guerrillas are not curbed.
Foreign Minister Shimon Peres urged Arafat to arrest Muslim clergy who
brainwash youths to commit suicide. ''It is clear that these youths who
committed suicide were incited by religious men,'' he said.
''They have to be found because in the end those who commit suicide
are also victims -- victims of stupidity and temptation.''
The bombings led to calls by Israeli right-wingers for Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin to halt talks with the PLO on extending Palestinian
autonomy.
At the United Nations today, Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali
condemned the bombings and urged the Israel and the PLO to continue
talks on implementing their 1993 peace accord. Israeli envoy Gad Yacobi
called on the international community to help combat terrorist groups
such as Hamas and Islamic Jihad.--Reuter/AP.

Luxembourg, Monday,
FOREIGN Secretary Douglas Hurd warned that failure to negotiate an end
to a bitter EU-Canada row over North Atlantic fish stocks would lead to
anarchy on the high seas.
''There has been progress
. . . the differences are not huge, but sufficient for it to be unwise
to say that a deal is in the bag,'' he told journalists.
He said he had held separate talks with the foreign ministers of
Canada and Spain and Commission officials, saying the alternative to
more negotiations was ''bad-tempered anarchy on the fishing grounds''.
Mr Hurd said there had been no criticism of his position by his
Spanish counterpart, Javier Solana. Madrid has previously accused
Britain of breaking EU solidarity by opposing measures against Canada
for seizing a Spanish trawler last month.
EU ministers had earlier called for greater efforts to resolve the
dispute with Canada on the share-out of quotas for fishing of Greenland
halibut, or turbot, off Newfoundland.
They urged officials to hold more talks to try to clinch a deal as
quickly as possible.
And tonight, Canadian Fisheries Minister Brian Tobin threatened
possible action by Wednesday to protect fish off Canada's shores if no
agreement was approved.
Tobin declined to call it an ultimatum, but expressed disappointment
that EU ministers had failed to approve a draft agreement in the
dispute.
He said there were two more EU meetings scheduled in the next 36
hours, after which the Canadian Government would discuss the outcome and
''take whatever measures are deemed appropriate to fulfil the primary
interest of the Government of Canada to ensure the protection of this
stock''.
Commission President Jacques Santer earlier told Spain that it was
unlikely Madrid would succeed in obtaining for the EU half a total quota
of 27,000 tonnes for fishing in the area this year.
However, EU sources said it might be possible to redistribute unused
quotas from non-EU countries, such as Japan and Russia, to give Spain a
higher permitted catch in return for concessions Madrid has made on boat
controls and inspections.--Reuter.

Los Angeles, Monday,
THE O J Simpson double murder trial, mired in turmoil and controversy,
is in danger of heading towards a hung jury and needs to be speeded up,
experts say.
Dr Robert Gordon, a noted jury expert, said he was not surprised at
widespread reports of squabbles and racial tensions among the
sequestered panel.
''The longer this trial goes on, the more the tension and stress being
felt by the jurors will be exacerbated, and the more likelihood there
will be of a hung jury,'' said Gordon.
Describing the case, in which Simpson, a black football hero has
denied murdering his white ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson and her white
friend, Ronald Goldman, as ''absolutely ethnic'', Gordon said there were
outside pressures on the eight black, three white, and one Hispanic
panellists.
''Jurors are not only concerned about doing the right thing, but about
how they are judged as jurors by their ethnic peer groups. They all have
to go back into their communities when this trial is over,'' said
Gordon.
Harlan Braun, a leading Los Angeles trial attorney who defended one of
the police officers in the Rodney King case, said: ''There's no doubt
about it, the jurors are going bonkers back there.''
He blamed Judge Lance Ito for the slow pace of the trial.
''He seems to be oblivious to the need to keep the case moving. He
seems to think that a five-hour working day is normal,'' Braun said.
He also criticised the judge for putting the trial on hold on Monday
while he attended to other matters.
Ito started the trial with six-hour days, then reduced it to
four-and-a-half hours a day before returning to six hours, but with only
three hours on Fridays.
''What's the matter with Saturdays? The jury's locked up in its hotel
doing nothing,'' said Braun.
Ito was forced on Friday to order a two-pronged investigation into the
allegations of dismissed juror Jeanette Harris, who claimed panel
members were discussing the case among themselves and that sheriff's
deputies guarding them were ''promoting racial tensions'' by favouring
white panellists over black.
Harris later recanted her allegation of jurors discussing the case,
saying she had meant only that they had the opportunity to do so had
they wished.
Gordon, however, said it was ''legal fiction'' to believe that jurors
do not discuss cases during trials, a sentiment echoed by Simpson
attorney Robert Shapiro, who said on Friday that jurors were only human
and it would be naive to think they would not talk about the trial among
themselves.
CNN reported yesterday that Simpson often used cocaine in the late
1980s and early 1990s, which sometimes caused arguments between him and
his then-wife. The claim was supported by Nicole Simpson's cousin, Rolf
Baur, his chauffeur, and club owner Jim Dallesandro.--Reuter.

Washington, Monday
FORMER US Defence Secretary Robert McNamara has broken a 27-year
silence about the US slide into the Vietnam War and his central role in
it, saying America should have pulled out of Vietnam as early as 1963.
However in an interview, McNamara said that a memoir being published
this week was not an apology for what came to be known as ''McNamara's
War'' during his seven years as defence secretary under Presidents John
Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson.
He said he and other top presidential advisers of that era, dubbed
''The Best and the Brightest'', had ''acted according to what we thought
were the principles and traditions of this nation . . . and yet I think
we failed.''
However, of his memoir, In Retrospect: The Tragedy and Lessons of
Vietnam, he said: ''It's not meant to be a mea culpa by myself or by
others. The particular objective is to draw lessons.
''We owe it to future generations.''
In the book, McNamara, now 78, echoes the arguments of politicians and
anti-war activists who condemned US involvement in a conflict that
scarred a generation, spawned deep distrust of the government, and
killed hundreds of thousands.
''We were wrong. Terribly wrong,'' he wrote.
He conceded that US policymakers misread virtually everything about
Vietnam, from Communist intentions and staying power, to the threat to
the West of a victory by Hanoi.
''Our misjudgments of friend and foe alike reflected our profound
ignorance of the history, culture, and politics of the people in the
area,'' he wrote.
The misjudged US friend was the anti-communist government of South
Vietnam, fatally flawed by intrigue, corruption, and instability. The
foe was the communist North, its Vietcong sympathisers in the South, and
big-power backers China and the Soviet Union.
McNamara concluded that the United States ''could and should have
withdrawn'' from South Vietnam as early as late 1963 after the
assassination of President Ngo Dinh Diem.
He said policymakers failed to grasp Hanoi's willingness to take
enormous casualties in a long war. Also, worried about a perceived
monolithic communist threat, they took no account of the centuries-old
hostility between Vietnam and China.
''Here again, the lack of expertise and historical knowledge seriously
undermined US policy,'' he wrote. He said Washington failed to
understand that agrarian North Vietnam, with a subsistence economy,
could not be cowed by bombing.
McNamara, who spent 13 years as World Bank president after leaving the
Pentagon in 1968, blamed himself and government colleagues for a series
of miscues that led to tragedy.
One of these was failing to grasp the limits of US power against
unconventional forces after Kennedy's 1961 decision to send military
advisers to South Vietnam.
By the time the war ended in 1975 with a Communist victory, millions
of US troops had seen Vietnam duty, with more than 500,000 on the ground
at the war's peak. At least one million Vietnamese died, along with more
than 58,000 Americans.
The main lesson, McNamara said, was that the government misjudged the
geopolitical aims of US foes and ''exaggerated the dangers to the United
States of their actions''.
''I want to put Vietnam in context,'' he wrote.
In one of his most historically significant judgments, McNamara said
Kennedy, had he survived, would have withdrawn US troops after
concluding that South Vietnam would never be able to defend itself.
After Kennedy's 1963, assassination, Johnson began massive ground troop
deployments in July 1965.--Reuter.

Benedict Brogan reports on the problems of Eurotunnel in its battle
with the ferries and how the weather could help ease its plight.
IF he hasn't done so already, Sir Alastair Morton should start praying
for extremely bad weather in the Channel over the next, say, 10 years.
What he wants is a perpetual gale, one bad enough to keep car ferries in
ports and make people afraid of the sea. In fact, weather so bad it will
have the millions of people in cars who cross to France each year
flocking to the entrance of the Channel Tunnel.
Sir Alastair, co-chairman of the tunnel operators Eurotunnel, reminded
us again yesterday how badly his company is doing. The #11 billion
mountain of debt Eurotunnel has accumulated in order to build this great
marvel of engineering threatens to overwhelm the company as it struggles
to get its train services running smoothly in time for the summer rush.
The summer, Sir Alastair said, will be crucial.
With the summer comes the tourists who swell the already large numbers
of regular Channel crossers. If Eurotunnel is to survive, it desperately
needs to attract 40% or more of that market. So far, with delays,
delays, and more delays, Eurotunnel has barely made a dent in it. With
#11 billion spent, much more needed, and impatient bankers closing in,
Eurotunnel is showing signs of battle fatigue.
The company owns the tunnel, but operates only half of its services.
The city-to-city, passenger-only Eurostar trains running between London,
Paris, and Brussels (and eventually from Glasgow and Edinburgh) are run
by a British, French, and Belgian railways consortium, who pay fees to
use the tunnel. Instead, Eurotunnel runs the drive-on drive-off Le
Shuttle trains, which rush cars and lorries between either end of the
tunnel in under an hour. And it is this service, in direct competition
with the ferries, on which Eurotunnel depends to start generating the
cash required to pay off its debts.
And so the prayer for bad weather. The ferry companies have been
preparing for the head-to-head battle with their new enemy ever since
the digging of the 31-mile fixed link between Britain and the European
mainland began. The once-smelly ferries have been turned into carpeted
pleasure barges, full of gaming machines, acres of duty-free shops,
video lounges for the kiddies, and food that is just about fit to eat.
All this in order to hang on to the travellers who would otherwise seize
at a less awful way of crossing the Channel.
Spurred on by the fear of losing their monopoly, the ferry operators
have invested enormous sums in their services, with an advertising
campaign to match. A two-hour crossing is now sold as the equivalent of
a leisurely cruise round the Med. And it has worked. Last year the
operators broke all records for numbers of passengers. P&amp;O European
Ferries carried 10.55 million passengers on the main Dover-Calais route,
18% more than in 1993, and 14 million on all routes, up 17% on 1993.
Stena Sealink carried a record seven million passengers. The number of
tourist vehicles carried increased overall by 21%.
Against that Sir Alastair offers a service that is a radical departure
from the ferry. Speed and drive-up-and-go are its two main selling
points. In theory drivers can just turn up, drive into the gleaming Le
Shuttle carriages, where they then sit for the 30 minutes it takes to
rush through the tunnel at 100mph. Motorway to motorway in under an
hour, without the trouble of reservations, the seasickness, or the
drunks.
In practice the delays in opening the tunnel have been compounded by
delays in receiving rolling stock. Le Shuttle hopes to get up to its
promised four services an hour in each direction in time for the summer
season. But last month Eurotunnel was put in the embarrassing situation
of having to admit that demand had outstripped capacity on three
consecutive sunny weekends: those without reservations were asked --
gulp -- to use the ferries. And that only after a series of nasty
confrontations with irate motorists which had some people swearing never
to try the tunnel again.
It was not what Eurotunnel needed. Already in February the ferries had
begun to heave their first sighs of relief. P&amp;O said the impact of the
tunnel's first months of operation had been ''absolutely nothing''. The
various operators let it be known that ''the enemy'' was no longer a
threat, at least for 1995. Estimates for the summer months showed no
signs of an impending customer melt-down, and 1994's record numbers
might even be surpassed.
The operators have worked on the assumption that most regular
ferry-users -- except for the one in seven who declare themselves
tunnel-phobic -- will sample the tunnel. The question, however, is
whether once tried the tunnel will prove enough of an attraction to keep
its customers. Anecdotal evidence suggests the London-to-Paris and
Brussels Eurostar services pose a severe long-term threat to the
airlines by offering a three-hour city-centre to city-centre service
without the hassle of the airport.
But Le Shuttle has always been a trickier proposition. For every
motorist keen to get the crossing over with as quickly as possible,
there are those who enjoy taking the break from driving offered by the
ferry. Le Shuttle has no restaurant, no bars, no lounges, and no duty
free -- Eurotunnel recently lost a court attempt to gain the same
duty-free privileges as the ferries, claiming unfair competition. There
is no hiding the fact that Le Shuttle may be fast, but it is
utilitarian, fancy-free, and boring.
Does the fate of Eurotunnel matter to the public? Sorry Sir Alastair,
but it shouldn't. As a long-term proposition the tunnel is a wondrous
thing. If the 220-odd banks that hold Eurotunnel's debt decide to call
in their loans, Sir Alastair will be out of a job, but the tunnel will
not be filled in. It is a permanent fixture, destined to revolutionise
the way people and freight travel to the Continent, regardless of the
weather.

GOVERNMENT veterinary officers launched an animal health investigation
after an outbreak of salmonella was discovered at a dairy farm, a court
heard yesterday.
The bacteria were found during post-mortem examinations on two of the
herd, which had been destroyed by vets due to their poor condition.
Paisley Sheriff Court heard that Ministry of Agriculture divisional
veterinary officer Dr Michael Lamont -- called in last June to examine
Barrodger Farm, at Beith Road, Lochwinnoch, Renfrewshire -- ordered
another of farmer John Harper's beasts, a bullock, to be destroyed on
the spot to put it out of its misery.
The animal was covered in ringworm-like bald patches and had a severe
septic wound to its foot. A post-mortem examination confirmed a number
of parasitic skin conditions, including lice, ringworm, and mange.
Dr Lamont said the condition of that one animal summed up the
''general air of neglect'' encountered by vets, animal cruelty
inspectors, environmental health officials, and police who subsequently
went to the property.
Sheriff Charles Stoddart previously heard claims that half of the herd
examined were suffering from lack of proper care and attention.
SSPCA officers discovered an open pit in a field, containing the
rotting carcasses of 10 mature cattle and seven calves.
Paisley vet Neil McIntosh, 32, went to the farm at the request of the
SSPCA. He described finding a shed containing cows suffering from a
range of problems which could, he said, have been cured through good
husbandry.
Many of the stock he examined were lame, due to untrimmed hoof horn.
He recommended that two of the worst-affected beasts -- those in which
the salmonella bacteria came to light -- should be slaughtered
immediately, and ordered that the others should receive urgent
veterinary attention.
Several of the cows were walking on their heels, as they could no
longer walk on their hooves due to entended growth which protruded
two-and-a-half inches in some cases.
Earlier, SSPCA inspector John Wilson said some of the beasts he
examined had weeping sores, infections on their backs and sides, and
swelling. Others were lame, could not stand up to support themselves,
were emaciated and showing signs of muscle wastage, while some were
simply lacking proper nourishment.
Mr Harper, 53, denies nine charges relating to conditions at the
property and the health and welfare of the animals.
He pleads not guilty to causing unnecessary suffering or distress to
an unspecified number of livestock; knowingly allowing carcasses to
remain unburied in a manner which would have allowed dogs access to
them; causing unnecessary suffering to two cows and a bullock by failing
to provide adequate care or veterinary attention; causing a cow to be
transported while it was unfit due to its poor condition, and abandoning
the animal in a field, in a manner likely to cause unnecessary
suffering; failing to dispose of animal by-product by burial; and
causing a breach of the peace by shouting and swearing.
The trial continues.

Madrid, Monday
A SCOTSWOMAN who has waited in prison in Spain for 13 months accused
of attempted murder will know her fate after Easter.
A panel of three judges at the Palace of Justice in Palma, Majorca,
retired today to consider prosecution demands for 12 years' imprisonment
against Jacqueline Smith, 36, from Greenock. Their decision will be
announced next week.
The court reconvened for final speeches after the case was adjourned
last October so that written questions could be put to her alleged
victim, Joseph Lancaster, 68. He had returned home to Preston,
Lancashire, and was too ill to travel to Majorca to give evidence.
At the earlier hearing, Smith claimed that she grabbed a kitchen knife
after Mr Lancaster attacked her in March last year in his bedroom at an
apartment he had on the holiday island. He was injured in an ensuing
struggle.
She said that she had gone to the flat to clean it and to make lunch
for him. After the meal she had walked into his bedroom where he was
lying naked.
''Come on Jackie. Show me what you do to your boyfriend,'' she claimed
he said before attacking her.
She pushed him away, ran to the kitchen, picked up a knife, and
returned to the bedroom.
''I wasn't going to do anything, just make him scared,'' she said.
However there was a struggle and he was injured.
She denied having regular sex with Mr Lancaster, however he claimed in
his written replies that they were lovers.
The state prosecutor told the court: ''There was only one thing on
this woman's mind -- to cause death or injury to Mr Lancaster.''
The defence claimed that she panicked when she was attacked and had
only meant to defend herself.
* A 38-year-old Spanish soldier was shot dead by suspected Basque
guerrillas in the northern city of San Sebastian. The attack bore the
hallmark of the separatist group Eta.

THE Edinburgh to London Super Shuttle Service, operated by British
Airways, yesterday became the first domestic flight route to carry one
million passengers in a year. The millionth passenger, businessman
Andrew Prentice, who works for British Gas in Edinburgh, was presented
with two complimentary tickets at a celebratory cake-cutting at
Edinburgh Airport. He was a passenger on the 10am service to Heathrow.
To cope with a 13% increase in passenger traffic in a year, the
airline now operates three 238-seater Boeing 767 wide-bodied aircraft at
peak times each day, while a mixture of smaller aircraft operate the
nine other daily flights on the schedule. Mr Gerry Fox, BA's customers
services manager, said: ''About 60% of passengers on the Edinburgh to
London service are now travelling for business purposes and to cope with
this growth we have made significant investment to improve facilities,
including an enlarged executive lounge and a dedicated hand baggage
check-in and telephone check-in service.

Vienna, Monday,
AUSTRIA'S Roman Catholic Church, already battered by allegations of
sexual abuse against its primate, received a further shock today when
another priest admitted a similar charge.
The new twist came as Austrian primate Cardinal Hans Hermann Groer
faced growing pressure to resign over accusations that he had sexually
abused a 17-year-old male pupil 20 years ago, which he has denied.
In the latest allegation August Wanger, a priest and former prefect of
the Roman Catholic Boromeus school in Salzburg, was accused by a former
male pupil in today's issue of the weekly news magazine, Profil, of
abusing him 30 years ago.
''Yes, I did it, and stand by this,'' Wanger told Austrian radio.
''This was a single case and I regret it. Apart from that time, I never
hurt anybody sexually.''
Wanger, 65, now teaching religion in a village near Salzburg, said
that even priests had their human weaknesses and should admit them.
Earlier today the Bishop of Carinthia, Egon Kapellari, added his voice
to growing hints from Catholic clergy that they would prefer Groer, 75,
to step down as Austria's church leader and Archbishop of Vienna.
''Whether the allegations were true or not, I would have resigned,''
Kapellari told Austrian state radio.
Josef Hartmann, 37, a former pupil at a Roman Catholic school for
boys, told Profil last month that Groer had molested him when teaching
there.
Kapellari echoed the views of the Bishop of Innsbruck, Reinhold
Stecher, who suggested yesterday that Groer had made a mistake by
keeping silent for nearly two weeks after the allegations were made
public.
''I made my position perfectly clear at the Austrian Bishops'
Conference that I would have preferred a clear word from the cardinal
right from the beginning,'' Stecher said.
''If I were to realise that some of the accusations were beginning to
stick, then I would have resigned my office despite my clear
conscience,'' Stecher said.
Groer was re-elected as the head of the Austrian Bishops' Conference
at a meeting last week but resigned two days later.
A survey in News magazine last week showed 62% of people in the
predominantly Catholic country in favour of Groer's resigning. The
percentage was higher when only practising Catholics were questioned.
Heide Schmidt, the leader of Austria's Liberal Forum political party,
said she was quitting the church because it had failed to address the
allegations adequately.
The man who made the latest accusations against Wanger, identified by
Profil only as Friedrich St., told Austrian radio Wanger's admission was
a great morale boost and would enable him to meet the priest face to
face.
''I find what he has done is an enormous and heroic act,'' Friedrich
St. said. -- REUTER.

ONLY 41 of the 520 NHS trusts have made firm pay offers over and above
the 1% on offer nationally to the 900,000 health workers and in many
cases efficiency ''strings'' will mean an actual loss of earnings.
This was the no-nonsense reply yesterday from Britain's largest union
Unison to suggestions that an increasing number of NHS trusts were
settling for the full 3% being claimed by the unions and other health
organisations.
It was conceded by Unison head of health Bob Abberley that 138 ''broom
cupboard whispers'' had been heard about improvements on the disputed 1%
national offer. However, firm offers numbered only 41, of which 35 were
accompanied by extensive ''strings'' in addition to the initial
''string'' of accepting the move to local negotiations.
These strings included linking improvements to achieving financial
targets, or reduced sickness or absence levels, converting statutory
holidays to annual leave, a freeze on all allowances (which can make up
to 20% of take-home pay), the acceptance of fully local pay next year,
or open-ended commitments to additional flexibility, the introduction of
a no industrial action clause or that payments over the 1% national
offer are not consolidated into basic rates for pension purposes.
Mr Abberley stressed that Unison members, who number around450,000 in
the NHS, were being recommended to reject all local trust offers pending
the outcome of consultation on the demand for 3% nationally. This should
be known by May 15 and could spark an immediate industrial action
ballot.
NHS trusts, whether by ineptitude or design, were seeking to persuade
staff that their local offers were worth more than was the case but he
said he remained confident that Unison members would realise what was
going on and decide accordingly.
He also warned that any acceptance of two-tier bargaining this year
would lead to full local negotiations next.
Only two Scottish NHS trusts figure in Unison's list -- Greenock,
which is said to have offered a total of 2.5%, and Grampian Healthcare,
which has offered 2.83% linked to the acceptance of a local trust
contract.

John Naughton takes a look inside the Birtist Broadcasting Corporation
and finds an organisation which is riddled with anxiety.
THE most intriguing question about the controversial Panorama
interview with John Major is how the BBC managed to dig itself into such
a ridiculous hole. Most old BBC hands -- and many current employees of
the corporation -- are baffled by the debacle. ''This would never have
happened even under Alasdair (Milne),'' said one of them to me last
week, ''and, God knows, Alasdair despised politicians.''
What this analysis ignores is that the BBC which went hubristically to
law two weeks ago bears as much resemblance to the corporation of
Milne's day as Boris Yeltsin's Cabinet does to Stalin's Politburo.
The new BBC is hierarchical, authoritarian, and riddled with anxiety.
When in July 1994 the veteran broadcaster Mark Tully talked about a
''climate of fear'' within the organisation he was immediately ridiculed
by senior BBC executives. But less than a week later an independent
survey of staff attitudes confirmed much of what Tully had claimed.
An institution in which (to quote a famous in-joke) ''an instruction
served merely as a basis for discussion'' has somehow been transformed
into one in which staff toe the ideological line -- or else face being
sidelined or sacked. The Birtist Broadcasting Corporation is a place
where those not part of the solution are now deemed to be part of the
problem. It is as if the Church of England woke one morning to find
itself being run by Opus Dei.
The old adage that dogs come to resemble their masters applies also to
organisations. John Reith's BBC was an extension of its
director-general's formidable, if warped, personality. In the 1960s,
''Auntie'' BBC was remodelled in Hugh Carleton Greene's (relatively)
liberal image. And the lean, mean BBC which has just screwed up in the
Scottish courts is very much the creation of its current chief executive
-- which is why those who know something of his style are not entirely
surprised by the debacle.
The first thing to note about John Birt is that he is slow to decide
and difficult to budge thereafter. By temperament a plodder with an
insatiable appetite for statistics, analysis, briefings, and expensive
consultancy, he is relentless and thoroughgoing in everything he does,
whether it is bringing BBC News and Current Affairs to heel or planning
a fell-walking expedition.
Guests at his holiday home in the Brecon Beacons are astonished to
find that even a post-prandial tramp is rarely accomplished without the
aid of navigational aids and a pre-planned route. ''I not only set out
with a compass,'' he once told the Financial Times, ''but know where I'm
going to spend the night. I do believe you need the structure and
security of a plan in order to depart from it.''
The irony of this is that Birt rarely departs from his plans: once
that pedestrian mind of his is made up it is rarely changed. This
temperamental inertia is reinforced by an aloof and hierarchical
managerial style. He is not one of those exciting executives who puts
himself about. You won't ever find John Birt drinking in the BBC Club.
''I do not believe,'' he once said, ''in the style of management much
practised in broadcasting, but not in other places, of constantly
undermining your senior managers by going around them all the time.''
Since he came to the BBC in 1987, he has communicated only with those
who reported directly to him. Given that the majority of these are
either shameless careerists or fanatical acolytes, this means that Birt
is sometimes dangerously insulated from contrary opinions.
In his speech to the Radio Assembly, Mark Tully raised parallels
between his DG and another imperious leader. ''Indira Gandhi,'' he said,
''became all-powerful, no-one dared to give her advice, let alone tell
her what was wrong. In the corporation today there are too many managers
who appear to be saying John Birt is the BBC and the BBC is John Birt.''
At the same time, Birt is extraordinarily sensitive to opinions from
certain other quarters. His mindset has been described as what in
Germany is called Radfahrermentalitat -- that of the bicyclist, forever
looking up while pressing downward on the pedals. This is a bit
simplistic (Birt has on occasion stood up to authority), but he is still
widely perceived within the BBC as sycophantic to those above him, and
oppressive to those below.
Since 1987 he has devoted a fantastic amount of time and corporate
resources (boxes at Ascot, Cheltenham, Wimbledon; lunches and dinners
with media celebrities at Broadcasting House; invitations to the last
night of the Proms -- to list just a few) to the cultivation of
influential back-bench MPs, Cabinet ministers, and important civil
servants.
The motives behind this ''mission to entertain'' are, of course, not
difficult to divine. The notion that the BBC is independent is one of
Britain's daftest constitutional myths. In reality, the corporation's
income from the licence fee is determined by the government of the day;
and its governors are appointed by the Heritage Secretary.
During Birt's tenure of office, this dependency has been even more
marked, for the BBC's charter comes up for renewal in 1996, and
everything he has done for the past few years has been geared towards
ensuring that the charter is renewed on the corporation's terms.
As a result, Birt's BBC has assiduously sought to avoid anything which
might have irritated the Government. It screened no troublesome
investigations into the wrongful convictions of the Guildford Four, the
Birmingham Six or the Maguire family, for example. Nor did any Death on
the Rock film issue from the vast journalistic machine which is BBC News
and Current Affairs.
And when embarrassing editions of Panorama have emerged at times that
were politically awkward for the Government, Birt and/or his
subordinates have regularly scrapped or deferred them.
Thus Peter Jay's scarifying account of how the Lawson boom had wrecked
the economy was pulled in the week running up to the last General
Election. Similarly, Birt blocked Panorama's expose of Britain's role in
building Saddam Hussein's ''supergun'' -- scheduled for transmission the
day Desert Storm was launched against the weapon's proprietor. And the
Panorama expose of Dame Shirley Porter's municipal activities was pulled
before the last local elections in England and Wales.
Those who bridle at the hypocrisy of pulling one edition of Panorama
which is embarrassing to Westminster Tories while seeking to transmit
one which would be helpful to their Scottish counterparts have not yet
fully grasped where Birt's priorities lie.
The present Government may be in terminal decline; the future may
indeed belong to Tony Blair's new model Labour Party (and Mr Birt is
tooling up for that eventuality, as those who saw him dancing the night
away at Mrs Blair's birthday party will testify); but the Conservatives
are still in government and the charter hasn't yet been signed, sealed
and delivered.
Until it has, the Government will continue to be accommodated by the
Birtist Broadcasting Corporation. And if the Scots don't like this state
of affairs, they can lump it.
* John Naughton is the Observer's television critic. His
(unauthorised) biography of John Birt will be published by Chatto.

Andrew Wilson weighs up the project's financial chances
EUROTUNNEL is at risk. ''In 1995 we may succeed or we may fail. Our
debt service costs may overwhelm us'' -- a statement to the Stock
Exchange from Eurotunnel co-chairman Sir Alastair Morton, which sent the
City into a tizz yesterday, its response being to mark the shares down
24p to 218p and to an all-time low.
At their peak, in 1990, they had reached 689p compared with the launch
price in December 1987 of 350p.
However, only a few hours later, Sir Alastair repeatedly said: ''We
are not going bust.''
He added that Eurotunnel is telling shareholders the importance of the
summer ahead, and he added: ''The game has not been totally played
yet.'' And with the tact and diplomacy with which he will always be
associated: ''Don't leap to conclusions, you will only rupture
yourselves.''
Eurotunnel has chalked up losses last year of #387m, and debt, as at
end-December, of #8000m. And, at present, much more intense competition
from the cross-Channel ferry companies than anyone could have envisaged,
thanks to the plethora of cut price-offers in various newspapers.
The immediate problem is to generate additional revenue, with much
depending upon the new timetable which was introduced on April 3, which
added a considerable amount of extra capacity. So far, while
cross-Channel traffic is rising, there has been a slight decline through
Dover for both cars and freight, with Eurotunnel claiming 20% overall
market share for March.
Its target for the end of 1995 is 30% of freight and 40% of tourist
traffic, rising to 40% and 50% respectively by the end of next year.
It is critical that the income targets are reached, although the
recent cost position has been better than expected.
There is a ''diplomatic strain'' between the company and the British
Government. A dispute is now in arbitration, with a decision due this
summer, in which Eurotunnel is claiming a total of #2300m from British
Rail and SNCF due to delays and cost overruns.
If the claim were met in full, then that would present the rail
privatisation programme with a huge funding problem -- unless the cost
were picked up by the taxpayer.
Sir Alastair is also railing against the subsidy paid to the ferry
companies, worth about #150m a year, thanks to the revenue they skim off
duty-free sales which are barred to Eurotunnel.
However, over the eight years during which Sir Alastair has guided the
project, there has been a series of crises of which this does not appear
to be the most difficult -- certainly as far as the operation of the
tunnel is concerned, as against the financial strength of Eurotunnel as
the operating company.
The inital forecast of a cost of #4700m always did seen far too low
for what was a unique tunnelling project with the most complex logistics
and some of the technical difficulties being only a guess at the initial
pre-planning stage.
There were delays with the boring machines, problems with the ground,
inadequate working space at the English end at Shakespeare Cliff at
Dover, where the initial work began, and so on.
The biggest setbacks were outwith the control of both Eurotunnel and
contractors TML, in the form of constant revision to safety requirements
by the regulatory authorities -- frequently after design work had been
completed -- while there has been late delivery of rolling stock.
Morale has been affected by constant sniping from some parts of the
Press -- both Sir Alastair and the banks have made heavy weather of this
point and contrasted the British newspapers unfavourably with their
French counterparts -- the perception of La Gloire seems more attractive
to those across the Channel.
The cost has now escalated to over #10 billion, but that is not
surprising for any really major project, whether it be Concorde,
Eurofighter. Also, Canary Wharf, and earlier the Suez and Panama Canals,
all went bust during construction.
However, it is inconceivable that the tunnel will fail and be turned
into the world's biggest mushroom farm.
Significantly, 93% of the bankers in the 225 strong international
banking syndicate, led by National Westminster and Midland Bank on the
UK side, signed an agreement last Friday. That allowed Eurotunnel a
waiver on its loan conditions, giving it access to #300m until the end
of October.
Four banks did not vote in favour -- two because they did not respond,
while two, which were overall in favour, did ask for certain conditions
which could not be met.
The financing talks in the spring of last year were much more
difficult, with those ''distant'' banks, or those in other hemispheres,
less enthusiastic than the British and Europeans.
A senior and prominent banker said yesterday that he could not see
failure happening. The project had reached fruition and there was now
rising revenue. Who would benefit from liquidation? A view obviously
that of the syndicate banks.
Shareholders who bought 100 shares at the time of the 1987 launch
would have put up #775 so far if they had also subscribed to the two
subsequent rights issues in return for an investment now worth about
#560.
The bulk of the shares are held by French investors, although most of
the tourist traffic is generated in Britain. Because of the weakness of
the pound against the franc, an identical holding in France will have
fallen to just #435.
At least shareholders have now been assured they will not be asked to
put up any more money, but it is unlikely they will see a return by way
of dividend until perhaps 2010. But they have helped finance one of the
world's finest constructions, which may offer a tiny consolation.

WOMEN are under-represented on Scotland's new shadow unitary
authorities in spite of Labour's spectacular success and its policy of
promoting female candidates.
Yesterday, Engender, the women's campaign group, called on political
parties to consider strategies aimed at increasing the number of women
councillors at the next local government elections in 1999. After last
week's election, only one fifth of new councillors on the 29 single-tier
authorities are women.
Speaking in Glasgow, campaign spokewoman Dr Alice Brown, senior
lecturer in politics at Edinburgh University, said the election results
were disastrous for Scottish women, more so given their greater
dependence on the services provided by local authorities.
Dr Brown said women made up a significant proportion of council
employees and the elections should have provided an opportunity to
increase the number of female councillors. Instead, 259 of the 1159
elected councillors were women, a rise of only 0.5% since the last
district elections.
She said that less than one third of Labour candidates had been women.
This, she said, was disappointing given Labour's commitment to promoting
women.
However, she added, the election results had thrown up some dramatic
regional differences. In East Ayrshire, half ofnew councillors were
women, while in Moray, Edinburgh, and Fife, the figure was more than a
third. However, in Midlothian the figure was only 6% and less than 20%
in Argyll and Bute, Dumbarton and Clydebank, and North Lanarkshire.
She said the results strengthened the case for positive discrimination
when it came to selecting candidates.
''We are calling on the political parties to show a real commitment to
fielding equal numbers of male and female candidates in winnable seats.
''Women in Scotland are hugely under-represented politically, with
little say in the decisions that affect our lives. We want an equal
share in power, to be able to change everyone's lives for the better.''

A CONSORTIUM of Scottish fishermen is hoping to secure funding for a
revolutionary method of transporting live prawns to the Continent, and
to provide a scheduled delivery service.
The scheme could create more than 50 jobs in the Western Isles but the
six members of Celtic Live Shell have warned that if they fail to get
cash support quickly, the idea could be taken over by the Spanish.
The method involves storing live prawns in individual compartments and
shipping them in boats fitted with tanks. The consortium is currently
hiring a boat but needs to buy two vessels for a scheduled service.
It has applied to the local enterprise company, Western Isles
Enterprise, for #750,000 of assistance, most of which would be in the
form of a loan and the rest in grant. It would then apply for a bank
loan to obtain the rest of the funds it needs.
Managing director John McLean said he feared that Spanish interests
would try to set up an operation using the same method to transport
prawns from Scotland to Spain, a big market for shellfish.
''The Spanish are very taken with the idea and they know that we have
proved it can be done,'' he said. ''But we very much want to keep this a
Scottish initiative. It is a huge innovation, the first in the world,
and it is going to be lost if we do not get the support we need.''
The consortium has already created 25 jobs for fishermen but Mr McLean
said it could employ as many as 55 people within a year if it could
begin a scheduled delivery service.
A spokesman for Western Isles Enterprise said the board was expected
to discuss the application for financial assistance today but no
decision would be taken. The board would simply make a recommendation to
be discussed by the Highlands and Islands Enterprise board later this
month.
The HIE, meanwhile, awarded a #750,000 grant to the producers of
farmed salmon to help improve research and marketing.
The Scottish Salmon Growers Association is researching ways of
combating fish disease and improved feeding techniques and the Scottish
Salmon Board is involved in major marketing drives in Britain and
France, using the ''tartan quality mark''.
Last year, Scottish salmon farmers, in an industry which employs
around 5000 people in the Highlands and islands, produced 43,000 tonnes
of fish, worth #130m.
Announcing the cash injection yesterday, Dr Maurice Cantlay of the HIE
said the grant recognised the vital role the industry played in the
economy of the area, particularly around more remote sea lochs and off
islands where alternative employment was scarce.
The industry is fighting back after three lean years which saw falling
prices, largely blamed on major production boosts in Norway.
Mr Marshall Halliday, of the salmon board, thanked HIE for its
continued support.

GOVERNMENT plans to equalise the age of retirement for men and women
at 65 are absurd at a time when more and more men and women are retiring
earlier, according to the TUC, which maintains there is an overwhelming
case for pensions for all at 60.
TUC General Secretary John Monks said yesterday that the Pensions Bill
''robs women, cheats men, and is flying in the face of what is going on
in the world of work''.
He was launching a new TUC report which demonstrates that the growing
gap between employees' actual retirement and pension ages is leading to
a ''twilight zone'' for millions.
Using official statistics, the report shows that throughout Great
Britain 55% of men aged between 60 and 65 no longer work, with a trend
towards even earlier retirement demonstrated by the 43% rate of men aged
between 55 and 65 who are not working.
For the over-60s, the level is slightly lower (53%) in Scotland as a
whole but considerably higher in Strathclyde, where the figure is 66%.
In the 55 to 64 category, Scotland rates just higher than average at
44%, with Strathclyde again hit harder than most at 55%.
Women are also retiring earlier, with 46% of those aged between 55 and
60 not working. Once again, the Scottish figure is slightly lower, at
45%, but at 54% the Strathclyde level is again well above average.
Women were expected to bear the full cost of equalising the state
pensions age and would be deprived of five years of pension -- worth
#14,756 at current rates -- they thought they had earned through
National Insurance contributions.
These figures make plans to raise their pension age to 65 ''even more
ridiculous'', says the TUC.
It is sending the report to MPs before they consider the Pensions
Bill, which is due to receive its second reading in the House of Commons
after Easter.
The Bill outlines Government plans to raise women's retirement age to
65 to bring Britain in line with European rulings that pension ages
should be the same for both sexes. The change would be phased in between
2010 and 2020, meaning that women currently aged 44 or less would be
affected by a later pension age.
The TUC disputes Government figures on the costs of equalising the
state pension at 60 with its own calculations by an independent actuary
who estimates the cost at #700m, once all the labour market effects are
taken into account, and not the #3500m claimed by the Government.
Accusing the Government of scaremongering about the costs of pensions
in the next century, Mr Monks added: ''It's only fair to equalise at 60,
bringing the retirement age and pension age closer together.''
Men and women were retiring earlier -- some through choice but many
because it was almost impossible for older workers made redundant to
find new jobs.

<HEADLINE>Fan crushed under bus after clashes</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A FOOTBALL fan died from multiple injuries when he fell under the
front wheels of a bus, following violent clashes between Crystal Palace
and Manchester United supporters, police said yesterday.
The man was named as Mr Paul Nixon, 35, from New Addington in Surrey.
Police said they were satisfied he died from falling under a Crystal
Palace supporters' bus on which he had travelled.
However, it is believed that Mr Nixon was attacked shortly before the
incident on Sunday. Three men from the Manchester area, aged 27, 28, and
29, were arrested yesterday in connection with his death. They were
later released on police bail without charge.
Two coachloads of Manchester United and Crystal Palace fans had been
in the New Fullbrook pub in Walsall before the English Football
Association Cup semi-final match at the Villa Park ground in Birmingham.
Violence broke out in the pub car park after closing time, with about
100 rival fans battling it out with bricks, stones, and bottles.
Superintendent John Plimmer confirmed that the name of footballer Eric
Cantona had been mentioned between the rival fans, this after Palace and
United supporters had been drinking for two hours on the same premises
without incident.
He said: ''These people who caused the trouble were in a minority in
that group. They would have fought with anything or anybody. All they
needed was an excuse. These were a nucleus of imbeciles who took it upon
themselves to create a lot of social distress.
''Anything will spark it off with these people and without a doubt it
was drink. It was not a pre-planned meeting -- it was coincidental but
this public house is well known throughout the footballing community,''
Mr Plimmer claimed.
During the skirmishes, another fan received serious head injuries. He
was named as Mr Dennis O'Leary, 35, from Thornton Heath, also in Surrey.
His condition was said to be stable yesterday.
As a team of 50 detectives continued to question the rival groups of
supporters, West Midlands police announced they had advised the FA that
the replay -- following Sunday's 2-2 draw -- should go ahead as planned.
West Midlands assistant chief constable Clive Roche said: ''The match
has to be played sometime. It is best it is played sooner rather than
later. We appreciate that tensions will be high but we don't think the
situation will be improved by delaying the match any further.
''But we would ask coach operators to follow their prescribed routes
and we appeal to the fans to avoid any violent action.''
In visiting the New Fullbrook pub -- eight miles from the Villa Park
ground -- both of the Manchester United and Crystal Palace buses whose
fans were involved in the trouble were off their designated routes.
There were a total of 84 arrests for drink-related offences during the
afternoon of the match. The replay will go-ahead tomorrow night.

CLAIMS of ''jobs for the boys'' yesterday greeted the appointment of a
top Scottish Office civil servant as #80,000-a-year head of one of the
three new public water and sewerage authorities.
The other posts have gone to men with long experience in delivering
local authority water services. The new bodies take over the council-run
services next year.
Mr Alastair Findlay, 51,who is Fisheries Secretary at the Scottish
Office, will become chief executive of the North of Scotland Water
Authority.
On top of the #80,000, the job carries a possible performance-related
bonus of up to 20% of salary. The contract is for at least five years.
Mr Findlay's appointment was condemned by the Scottish National Party,
which is bitterly opposed to the Government's policy of removing water
services from council control.
Vice-president Andrew Welsh said it was ''an outrage'' that Scottish
Secretary Ian Lang was charging ahead with his plans to remove
Scotland's water from democratic control, despite the massive
thumbs-down the Tories had received at last week's local elections. Mr
Lang was continuing ''to swim against the tide of Scottish opinion''.
Mr Welsh added: ''Ian Lang will find it difficult to convince the
Scottish people that his appointment of a man whose whole career has
been in the Civil Service is anything other than a 'jobs for the boys'
appointment -- particularly when the closest he has come to the water
industry appears to be the time he has spent as Fisheries Secretary at
the Scottish Office.''
Mr Jim Wallace, for the Liberal Democrats, criticised the #50,000 paid
to employment specialists Andrew Rait Ltd to search for the new heads.
''Consultants appear to be the only people deriving any benefit from
current Government policy,'' he said. ''Where quangos are concerned,
money seems to slip through Government fingers like water.''
The Labour-led Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, which also
opposes the Government's policy on water, said it was ''a great shame''
that the Secretary of State could not have recognised just how much
skill there was in Scottish councils and made all three appointments
from local government.
Cosla's president, Councillor Rosemary McKenna, said: ''While I do not
doubt Mr Findlay is a very able man, the fact remains that he has no
experience of providing services directly to the public; services which
will be paid for by the council taxpayers of Scotland.''
Water and sewerage were essential services and she would have thought
it only common sense to draw on the experienced pool of talent which
already existed for such a senior and vital appointment.
Mr Ernest Chambers, 47, the present director of Strathclyde region's
water services, is to become chief executive of the West of Scotland
Water Authority, and Mr Rod Rennet, 52, Tayside region's director of
water services, will head the East of Scotland Water Authority.
Councillor McKenna said they would bring a wealth of experience,
expertise, and skill to the jobs.
Commenting on the three appointments, Mr Lang said the challenges
facing the new authorities were considerable but he was confident the
chief executives had the necessary ability, experience, and
determination to meet them.
Initially, he said, they would have the task of preparing for the
transfer of services in April next year and planning for the merger of
the present water and sewerage services into a single cohesive unit.
The three chief executives will each earn #80,000 a year with a
possible performance related bonus. They have five-year contracts which
can be renewed.
A row broke out previously when it was learned that the three
part-time chairman of the new water authorities would be paid a combined
total of more than #100,000 a year.
The chairman for the West of Scotland is Mr John Jameson, a chartered
surveyor; for the East of Scotland, Dr Ian Preston, retiring chief
executive of Scottish Power; and for the North of Scotland authority, Mr
John Robertson, a businessman who chairs Highland Health Board.
What the executives bring to the job.
MR Alastair Findlay is a career civil servant who joined the
Department of Agriculture and Fisheries at the Scottish Office in 1966
after graduating from Edinburgh University.
In 1975, he went on loan to the Diplomatic Service and was First
Secretary (Agriculture and Food) at the British Embassy in the Hague.
After returning to the Scottish Office, he had a spell as Under
Secretary at the Industry Department covering Energy, Highlands and
Islands, Tourism, Scottish Enterprise, and Employment and Transport
portfolios. He has been Fisheries Secretary since 1993.
MR Ernest Chambers is a graduate of Dundee University. He was formerly
with the Lower Clyde Water Board in Paisley and joined Strathclyde
region as an area engineer in 1975. He was appointed as the region's
director of water in 1988. He became director of water services last
October and was responsible for merging the council's water and sewerage
services.
MR Rod Rennet, who graduated from Dundee Institute of Technology, has
been director of water services for Tayside Regional Council since 1988.
He previously worked with a number of public authorities, including
Dundee Port Authority, Durham County Council, and the city engineer's of
Chester and Dundee.

WITH Tony Blair choosing to send his children to a grant-maintained
school, are Labour and the Tories now united on parental choice?
Not really. Mr Blair and two of his shadow ministers, who have also
opted for GM schools, have simply made it more difficult for their party
to achieve credibility on this issue. Ironically, in his speech
celebrating his election as Labour leader, Mr Blair announced to great
applause: ''If it is not good enough for my children, it is not good
enough for theirs.'' Since that historic day, he has apparently decided
that no school in Islington is good enough for anybody's children.
Yet Labour would not subscribe to the Tory philosophy of strengthening
the strong, even if it means further weakening the weak. The Government
is about to set up a pilot scheme in Wales, under which schools which
are already oversubscribed can apply for large one-off capital grants to
build extra classrooms. In other words, the funding will follow the
pupil and under-utilised schools, many of them no doubt doing an
excellent job, will find their numbers becoming even more depleted. The
result will be the closure of schools in communities which need them,
based on the mushrooming effect of ''popularity'' rather than an
analytical comparison of the qualities of different schools.
Though Labour would not go as far as this -- indeed, it has just
started a dialogue with GM schools about the possibility of
reintegrating them into the local authority network -- there is no doubt
that the party has created problems for itself by espousing parental
choice. It has no answer to the dilemma that, for many parents, there is
effectively no choice at all. Nor has it found a way of preventing
parental choice from emptying some schools to the extent that closure
becomes inevitable. Policies which are assets in Opposition could become
liabilities in power.
All the parents in our school received a letter from the head teacher,
warning us that when the new local authorities come into being next
year, our children might suffer unless there was ''joint provision of
services''. What is it all about?
Most of the new councils will be smaller and the fear is that some of
them will not be able to afford services which at the moment can be paid
for through ''economies of scale''. For instance, the largest
authorities -- such as Strathclyde and Lothian -- run operations like
advisory or educational development services, psychological services and
catering on a region-wide basis. The question is whether these big,
centralised structures will have to be broken up when the new councils
take up office.
Realising the dangers, the Secretary of State for Scotland has made it
clear that he would like to see the new unitary councils in an area sit
down at an early stage and talk about the advantages of sharing the
costs and responsibilities of maintaining these important services. In
theory, it makes eminent sense -- the structures, staffing and expertise
are there, and the danger is that fragmentation could lead to
disappearance. In practice, it may not prove all that easy -- some of
the new councils, however small, will be keen to demonstrate that they
have the ability to survive on their own. Moreover, in any proposed
scheme of joint provision, the partner councils will be of unequal size
and the smaller ones will be afraid of being dominated by their larger
neighbours.
If common sense prevailed, local agreements could be reached, because
the odds are that some councils will quickly realise that they cannot
afford the luxury of, for example, their own permanent psychological
services. In the meantime, pupils and parents must remain in
uncertainty. Compared to the present situation, they have potentially
little to gain and much to lose.
Is it fair that universities -- and departments within them -- can
vary their entry requirements from year to year?
I don't know if it's fair but it's certainly a fact of life. Colleges
of education have been known to do the same -- reducing their entry
qualifications when there was a shortage of applications, and vice
versa. It's largely down to supply and demand, especially now that
university finances are affected by their ability to manage student
quotas.
The other aspect of the argument is that, irrespective of the
university, some faculties consistently demand higher entry
qualifications than others. Law and medicine are examples of this.
Whether you agree with this policy depends on whether you accept that
such subjects require the greatest academic rigour. They certainly
require, as well as intellectual capacity, sustained stamina and
commitment.
A-Levels in England are always being described as the ''Gold
Standard''. If there is some doubt about the credibility of Advanced
Highers as envisaged under Higher Still, why not go for something like
the A-Level format?
A-Levels are gradually losing their own credibility. For a long time
they have been regarded, by teachers in particular, as too narrow in
scope and too specialised. In this respect they fare badly in comparison
with equivalent awards on the continent.
Protection of the ''gold standard'' has been seen as a priority
throughout the lifetime of the present Government, but there are now
indications that this could change. In relation to A-levels themselves,
the introduction of the core skills of literacy, numeracy and
information technology is now believed to be under active consideration.
This would have the effect of broadening A-Levels and might lead to an
18-plus diploma comprising core skills, A-Levels and vocational courses
such as General National Vocational Qualifications (GNVQs), which are
achieving wide popularity.
While A-Levels would be retained, the changes which the Government is
considering would afford recognition to the 30% or so of pupils who at
the moment either fail them or drop out. Under the present arrangements,
most pupils take two or three A-Levels over a two-year course. Now there
would be a new examination system under which pupils could take up to
five subjects in one year. This would lead to the award of a new
qualification, after which pupils could either leave school or continue
for an extra year to take A-Levels. Such a system would also offer
potential benefit to more able pupils, who would be able to take a more
balanced mix of arts and science subjects.
Since the investigations which may lead to the setting up of this new
structure are being conducted by the influential School Curriculum and
Assessment Authority, chaired by Sir Ron Dearing, there is every reason
to think that there will be a positive outcome. The way has been
prepared by the success of GNVQs, which are having an impact in breaking
the monopoly of A-Levels. It is gratifying to see the English eventually
moving towards the introduction of a qualification akin to the
long-established Scottish Higher. They learn slowly, but at least they
learn.
Some time ago you disowned your column's title -- Louden Clear. I
think it's super. Whoever devised it deserves congratulations.
Thanks for nothing. I'll tell him.

Head teacher, Doug Marr, speaks about his concerns for the future
under the new unitary councils, reports Barclay McBain
THERE are about 2400 local authority primary and secondary schools in
Scotland. As of vesting day, April 1, 1996, they will, by and large,
have new political masters as the unitary authorities emerge from their
year in the shadows to run education.
But what role will the unitary authorities have, and how will it
affect our schools? Doug Marr, headteacher of St Machar Academy, a
1200-pupil inner-city secondary in Aberdeen, believes that local
government reorganisation cannot be seen in isolation, either for
schools or councils.
Vesting day is also the deadline for at least 80% of school-based
budgets to have been devolved to headteachers. And the next round of
compulsory competitive tendering will be on its way. ''These are three
forces which will impinge on schools in a very short time,'' said Mr
Marr.
He sees pros and cons in local government reform but has deep concerns
about the potential disadvantages. These are born partly of his
experiences of being head of a school which has benefitted from
councillors, and an education directorate, committed to making a
substantial investment in combatting deprivation by giving disadvantaged
young people a better chance in life.
In his seven years at St Machar the roll has nearly doubled. Mr Marr
will leave at the end of the session to become head of Banchory Academy,
which is in the new Aberdeenshire council.
Looking back on his time at St Machar, Mr Marr said: ''We have had
tremendous support from Grampian region. An elightened approach to the
arts has allowed us to develop a wind band programme. We have 150 pupils
in our bands. We have a similar model for the promotion of dance.
''Clearly we would be concerned that such an enlightened, supportive
policy would still be possible under the smaller unitary authority.''
But, as he pointed out, the new authorities will be strapped for cash
and will have to make difficult decisions about what stays and what
goes.
In England, education funding cuts have caused school governors to
make tough decisions about teacher redundancies. This has not happened
here but the experience of cash-strapped councils could easily be
replicated. South of the Border, instrument tuition, for example, has
gone by the board in some authorities because, set against the
educational fundamentals, it has been seen as a luxury.
''There is an honourable tradition of providing such services in
Scotland which, for many, would be irreplaceable if they went,'' said Mr
Marr. He also has concerns about economies of scale being lost as the
bigger regions are broken up.
''Schools have been able to assume that they will have the support of
advisory, psychological, technical, and library services. While a fairly
large unitary authority could probably continue to offer these, what
will the position be in the smaller ones? I think it would be setting
the clock back if these services were lost,'' he said.
The head worries about the removal of the statutory requirement on
councils to appoint a director of education and have an education
committee. ''Education has enjoyed a high profile by having directors
and committees for that purpose. If that were diminished and combined
with social work, for example, you might get a dilution of purpose and
you might get competition for resources.''
Like other heads, Mr Marr wonders if local government reorganisation
and devolved school management might promote opting out in smaller
unitary councils which will be restricted to delivering fewer services.
Parents and some heads might conclude that, with at least 80% of budgets
being devolved, they might be as well to take responsibility for all
funding, which would come direct from the Scottish Office.
Scottish schools should, however, be spared the excesses of the harsh
funding model for devolved management in England and Wales. Here, about
75% of the minimum 80% to be devolved to heads goes on teachers'
salaries and employee costs. Scottish schools have the reassurance of
their staffing budgets being allocated on the basis of real rather than
average costs. In England, experienced teachers who ''cost'' more
continue to be vulnerable because staffing budgets are based on average
costs and the temptation is for schools to recruit younger teachers at
the lower end of pay scales.
Unitary councils will have a key role in determining and resourcing
education policy but Mr Marr speculates that, in their early days, they
may -- having lost an empire -- be looking for a role. ''Because of
budgets going to schools they will be looking to see where they fit in
the new pattern,'' he said.
It will be more difficult to follow because the next round of
competitive tendering will look at such areas as legal services. At
present schools take for granted local authority advice on legal,
accounting, and financial matters but they will also have to go out to
tender. ''There will be implications for heads. They will no longer have
the security of authorities about them and they will have to go into the
marketplace,'' said Mr Marr.
All in all there will be great uncertainty, which will extend even to
curricular matters. Mr Marr wonders if the part the bigger regions have
played in curricular change can be sustained in the unitary model.
''Because of the number of staff they employ and the resources they can
deploy they have been able to release staff, and pilot materials. There
has been concerted support for curricular development. Can that be
co-ordinated in the more fragmented structure?'' he asked.

<HEADLINE>Officers were 'bystanders of disaster' Hillsborough police fail to win damages</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>6</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>978944183</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
SIX police officers who claimed their lives were wrecked by witnessing
the horrors of the Hillsborough disaster yesterday lost their court
battle to win damages from their own chief constable.
The five policemen and one policewoman were test cases for a total of
23 officers involved in the action, claiming up to #250,000.
They claimed that negligence on the part of South Yorkshire Chief
Constable Richard Wells had led them to be exposed to the aftermath of
the football disaster on April 15, 1989, when 96 fans were crushed to
death. They said it left them suffering psychiatric disorders and
post-traumatic stress.
However, Mr Justice Waller, sitting at the High Court in Sheffield,
dismissed their claims.
Mr Benet Hytner, QC for the officers, said: ''The sight that met the
eyes of those who were in or near the pens was gruesome. After the
bodies were taken to the gymnasium, the scene there again was utterly
horrific.
''Considerable numbers of police officers suffered psychiatric
illness. Some remain ill, others were rendered unfit for further service
and left the police force, and others recovered and continued their
service,'' he said.
Mr Justice Waller said that in law a bystander of a horrific traumatic
incident was not entitled to claim for psychiatric damage.
''Bystanders should be fortified to stand the calamities of modern
life,'' said the judge.
He went on: ''The six officers came within the same category as
bystanders because they were not sufficiently involved in the immediate
horror, were not closely related to the victims, and were in effect
secondary victims.''
The judge added: ''Police officers should be more able to deal with
traumatic events than ordinary bystanders being persons of extraordinary
phlegm.
''It is part of a police officer's duty to deal with situations which
might cause psychiatric injury to ordinary people. The plaintiffs did
not make any allegation they were in any physical danger.''
The officers claimed Mr Wells's negligence, as their employer, placed
them in a position at Hillsborough where they suffered psychiatric
damage.
However, the judge said: ''I do not think the nature of the
relationship between the plaintiffs and the chief constable gives them
any advantage over ordinary bystanders.
''My conclusions are that I dismiss these plaintiffs claims for the
reasons I have stated and judgment is with costs for the defendants.''
It is expected that an appeal against the decision will be lodged.
Mr Wells said after the hearing: ''The judgment will be met with a
sense of relief by the whole of the police service, by South Yorkshire
Police in particular, and by the 1400 police officers on duty that day
who did not make a claim.''
He told a news conference: ''It will send a very clear signal that
when members of the public take the oath of allegiance for the office of
constable, they are to expect hardship, danger, death, and to some
extent, disaster.''
Mr Wells went on: ''None of us has found this pleasant. All of us have
encountered that sort of incident at some stage during our lives as
police officers. Here are a body of people who have signed up to
undertake tasks known to be extra difficult and extra hard.''
He said that out-of-court damages awards had been made to 14 other
officers who were ''more closely, more directly, involved''.
The ruling over compensation for police officers traumatised by the
Hillsborough disaster hinged on whether they should have expected to
deal with such horrific scenes in the line of duty.
The case was the first claim against South Yorkshire Police by its
officers for mental stress caused by their duties.
Legal experts feared that, if successful, the cases could have
heralded a huge number of claims from members of the emergency services
and the Armed Forces.
The officers' decision to sue is said to have deeply embarrassed not
only Mr Wells but angered relatives of the 96 who died.
Liverpool fans attending the FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham
Forest were crushed and suffocated in a crowd surge at the Sheffield
Wednesday ground.
South Yorkshire police, Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, and
Eastwood and partners, a firm of consulting engineers, have already
accepted liability in the cases of 14 officers who carried out rescue
work inside the pens on the terraces.
The 23 cases are of officers who acted on the pitch to help victims or
were on duty at a temporary mortuary at the ground or at a hospital
mortuary.
The six named officers, five of whom have retired on medical grounds,
complained of recurring nightmares, nervous exhaustion, and depression.
Lawyers for the officers argued that the force had breached its duty
of care by allowing the situation to occur.
In written statements, the officers accused their superiors of
betraying and abandoning them without orders as fans, many very young,
were crushed against railings.
One officer, Constable Geoffrey Glave, 45, helped St John Ambulance
staff treat the injured. ''It was only when I went into the gym, which
had been turned into a temporary mortuary, that I realised how many
people had died.
''It has made me irritable and unable to concentrate. I suffer severe
depression.''

DUNDEE is to erect its first public statue this century, a #20,000
bronze figure to commemorate a newspaper seller.
The late Tommy Small, who sold papers in the streets for more than 60
years, will grace, life-size, the city centre site of his last pitch at
the corner of High Street and Reform Street.
Mr Small, a tall man of few words, was renowned for his aversion to
soap and water to such an extent that members of the public often
received their change with some trepidation. His fashion sense evidently
faded at some time around the end of the Second World War. He died
several years ago and is not survived by any family.
The public were not consulted but Scottish Enterprise Tayside is
putting up #5000 of public money for the statue and Tayside Regional
Council is being recommended by its planning chief to put up another
#5000.
The city has no monument to Winston Churchill, its MP for 15 years; no
statue of Scottish patriot William Wallace, who attended school in
Dundee; no memorial to James Chalmers, inventor of the adhesive postage
stamp; and no monument to James Bowman Lindsay, the pioneer of the
electric telegraph.
Nor has it developed the sense of humour required to commemorate
McGonagall, the city's self-styled poet, Oor Wullie, or Desperate Dan.
The Tory group leader on Dundee District Council, Mr Neil Powrie,
said: ''The people who are pushing this idea should be certified. This
just ridicules the city and makes a joke out of Dundee. What did Tommy
Small ever contribute to Dundee?''
Tayside's director of planning, Mr Jack Searle, countered: ''Most
statues are erected to people who made a lot of money or killed a lot of
people. Why shouldn't we have a statue of a common man who was a
well-known character in the city?''

Washington, Monday
SENATOR Bob Dole made it official today: he declared that he was
running for the presidency, as the candidate of Kansas, his home state,
and all those other places far from Washington.
He denounced the federal government and all its works, and its leaders
for losing contact with real Americans. He has been a prominent
political figure in Washington since 1961, and is himself one of those
leaders he condemned this morning.
He is not the only insider running as an outsider, but he is certainly
the most prominent. He is also the oldest. He is now 71 and will be 73
at the next presidential inauguration. It is his third bid for the
presidency in 15 years.
Senator Dole is the Republicans' leader in the Senate, and will try to
balance his legislative responsibilities with the exigencies of
campaigning. It will not be easy. Senator Lyndon Johnson, a much more
powerful figure than Senator Dole, was defeated by a neophyte colleague
in 1960 when he tried the same thing.
Senator Dole made his announcement on the 50th anniversary of the day
he was wounded in one of the last battles of the Second World War. That
was in Italy, and he lost the use of his right arm. He spent three years
in hospital recovering, a personal experience that he claims prepared
him for the harsh realities of the world.
He says that his generation deserves one last chance to serve their
country, and implicitly puts down President Clinton and other
baby-boomers as unready for responsibility.
Senator Dole is now the favourite to win the Republican nomination. It
is not always a comfortable position: every other candidate will gang up
against him. He is the best known and most popular in the party, even
though there are many to the right of him who accuse him of insufficient
conservatism.
Newt Gingrich, Speaker of the House, once memorably called him ''the
tax collector of the welfare state''. The senator believes much more
strongly in balancing the budget than in lowering taxes. That was one
reason he lost the nomination to Ronald Reagan in 1980 and to George
Bush in 1988.
Those two both recognised that tax cutting was far more popular than
eliminating the federal deficit. Senator Dole faced the dilemma squarely
today, in the best tradition of modern politics, and insisted that we
can have it both ways.
''We can cut taxes and balance the budget,'' he said. He promised to
rein in the government. Some of his rivals want to do much more than
that. They want practically to abolish it. That will be one of the great
debates of the coming election campaign.

New York, Monday
ACTRESS Elizabeth Taylor popped pills like sweets to cope with a
marathon of affairs and marriages, according to an unauthorised
biography.
The 63-year-old actress tried to win a court order to stop publication
of Liz: An Intimate Biography of Elizabeth Taylor by C David Heymann.
She also tried to block NBC from broadcasting a mini-series based on
the book but a judge ruled the network had a right to broadcast the
story.
The book, due out this week, catalogues drug use along with Taylor's
eight marriages and alleged affairs with Frank Sinatra, Rock Hudson, and
Victor Mature.
''Miss Taylor's feeling is that she doesn't read unauthorised
biographies and she doesn't comment on them,'' said her spokeswoman.
Heymann also wrote the best-seller A Woman Named Jackie and Poor
Little Rich Girl: The Life and Legend of Barbara Hutton.
The Taylor biography says that without her knowledge, her third
husband, Michael Todd, taped their lovemaking and passed out copies to
his pals.
Her first husband, Nicky Hilton, punched her so hard that she needed
medical treatment, the book claims.
1 The book says the star fought a 10-year battle with prescription
drugs. In 1981 she had more than 300 prescriptions.
The book also alleges that her father, Francis Taylor, was
bisexual.--AP.

Nairobi, Monday
THE Organisation of African Unity is sending a peace mission to
Burundi, where diplomats fear ethnic violence threatens a bloodbath
similar to last year's genocide in Rwanda.
A Kenyan Foreign Ministry official said the mission, led by OAU
Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim, would include the foreign ministers
of Egypt, Mauritius, Tunisia, and South Africa. It will leave for
Burundi on Wednesday.
''The team is part of the OAU's conflict resolution programme. It will
assess the situation in Burundi and see how the rest of the continent
can best help,'' said official Richard Sanga.
African diplomats said the OAU feared that Burundi may go the same way
as Rwanda, where a million people were slaughtered in ethnic massacres
last year.
''That worry deeply exists and the OAU wants to be seen as taking some
form of action before the situation gets out of hand and reaches the
Rwanda levels,'' said a diplomat.
Burundi and Rwanda have the same ethnic mix of Hutu and Tutsi.
Burundi, where a Tutsi army has held power since independence, has
been torn apart by ethnic violence since the 1993 assassination of
elected president Melchior Ndadaye, a Hutu, by renegade Tutsi soldiers.
More than 50,000 people have been killed.
In Paris, a French minister branded the US ambassador to Burundi a
warmonger for advocating military intervention in the country while
refusing to send in American troops.
''I have met him several times. He is a warmonger,'' said Co-operation
Minister Bernard Debre of Ambassador Robert Krueger.
Krueger, a former Texas senator appointed ambassador to Burundi early
last year, publicised what he, an aid worker, and survivors said was the
slaughter of some 400 members of the majority Hutu tribe in Muyinga.
Survivors said Tutsi soldiers and gangs were responsible. However the
army has denied the reports, saying that only some 20 Hutu guerrillas
and civilians were killed in clashes.
''I am a little wary of the American ambassador because he wants
intervention but he does not want to commit American troops,'' Debre
told journalists.--Reuter.

An innovative book takes a stand on the growth and development of the
child. But, Andrew Popple finds, it falls down in presenting only one
side of the argument.
IN GREEK mythology, Gaia was ''the Earth'' personified, and the
goddess of the whole earth. Natural Childhood is published by Gaia
Books. But if I thought this book was destined for the whole of the mass
market, it would make me disappointed and angry, and I suppose it does
anyway. But more of that later. As it is, despite the dedication,
research and -- yes -- love that went into its production, it leaves me
rather bemused.
On one level it is a superb compilation of good, caring ways for you
to enable your child to develop his/her full potential. As a collection
of childcare and education principles, majoring on Rudolf Steiner's work
and presenting insights into ''alternative'' and ''human scale''
education, it is interesting. But the language is of a kind that could
turn off a no-nonsense type, with its references to ''a rediscovery of
the human being'' who ''becomes an apprentice in the service of his
universe''. Not to mention anthroposophic medicine. And the children are
always in groups which represent a happy cultural mix, and they are
always clean, never even grubby.
The ''Natural'' in the title refers to a oneness with the natural
world, an understanding of the inner self and a desire to fulfil all the
latent potential we possess, and I do not knock such ideals at all. But
we don't have to use such precious language. Hidden in the extended and
New Age vocabulary are some wonderful insights into real, even ordinary,
human behaviour and along with these some damn good ideas -- for
instance an acceptance that kids will make guns from sticks, but that
this is more imaginative and less accepting of real guns than buying
them toy replicas.
There are lots of beautiful photographs and drawings. These illustrate
rather than illuminate the text, which takes a ''present the evidence,
draw a conclusion, make recommendations'' line. The many quotes stand
alone as valuable insights into our common problem, but otherwise this
is not a pick up, put down book. You need time, plenty of it, to read
and digest the contents.
Therein lies the problem. What is this book, what are its objectives?
Is this a research thesis in sheep's gilet? Or is it a book for the
already converted? Or again, an outreach tract to bring you in to the
whole-earth fold? Judging from the tacit assumption of reader sympathy
with the book's basis, it aims to be a mixture of the last two. But in
terms of style it owes a lot to academic papers.
For the uninitiated, using this book as a practical childcare guide is
virtually impossible as you are simultaneously trying to comprehend and
then accept the spiritual, even mystical, infrastructure. This weight of
supporting creed or dogma is largely unnecessary in a ''practical''
book. It gets in the way of the supposed purpose, and could well deter
those who don't feel like being preached at.
If you accept the authors' views, or can desist from shouting at the
page too often, the childcare practices they advocate range from the
outstandingly original through the supremely obvious, to the downright
dotty. Identifying which you consider are which is the exciting bit --
where, for instance would you place ''in summer, gather lavender and
rose petals to make herb pillows'' and ''dress your child according to
the season''?
I am not at all sure about some of the Illnesses of Childhood chapter.
The advice regarding fever treatment seems reasonable enough, but I get
twitchy when the anti-vaccination argument becomes very polysyllabic,
and ominous-sounding side effects are tossed in. It is important to
remember that this is not a mainstream, nor even a balanced, book and we
must seek all the information we feel we need before translating our
views into actions on our child, especially when it comes to questions
of healthcare. This book is an addition to the debate, not an
authoritative statement.
At #18.99 a copy, Natural Childhood is aimed at a niche market, those
who have Gaian, holistic, New Age or similar beliefs and have the
resources to put their money where their faith is. It presupposes an
acceptance of its own guiding principles, and offers little to reconcile
these principles with any religious beliefs. Nevertheless, as a
childcare book it has a welcome focus on how the child might see life.
And why should this pacific, mystical book make me angry? Because,
despite all the political correctness surrounding equality of race and
gender (''he'' and ''she'' in alternate chapters) I cannot find one
single mention of acceptance and integration into the community for the
impaired or disabled. Unless you count a single, fatuous sentence on the
flysheet. Physical disability does not mean reduced intellectual
capability or needs; mental impairment does not mean inability to enjoy
life.
True, there is a special section in the bibliography and a half-page
treatment of the residential care offered by the Camphill movement --
but these reinforce the view of the impaired as a societal group apart.
Not only is this against current trends, but isn't it contrary to the
Gaian philosophy of equality of value and opportunity? Wheelchairs and
artificial limbs may not be as photogenic as a colourful, healthy,
cultural mix, but aren't they too an important part of real-life Natural
Childhood?

A 23-year-old man was fighting for his life in Bradford Royal
Infirmary this morning after being shot three times by police marksmen.
He was hit in the chest and limbs after two police marksmen opened fire
with semi-automatic weapons.
The man, who had been involved in a domestic incident earlier on, had
already fired from a sawn-off shotgun at two unarmed policemen. As
police marksmen ''begged'' the man to put down the gun he continually
threatened them with it and also aimed it at passing motorists and
pedestrians in Wakefield Road, Odsal, Bradford.

She was concerned when her offspring joined, but now HELENE WITCHER
has a healthy respect for a well-rehearsed, celeb-spotting sisterhood.
THEY rise quietly around 4.30am, slip from sleeping households and
make their way to dawn trains and buses into Glasgow. It is Saturday
morning. Teenage girls, in surprisingly large numbers, are setting out
for another day dedicated to a compulsive hobby.
Notching up sightings is a familiar popular pastime. Twitchers,
Munro-baggers and even stamp collectors are all known to go to
extraordinary lengths to record the latest species, summit or stamp for
the album. These teenagers are part of an old tradition then, but they
are also part of a new phenomenon cultivated by the mass media. They
have developed close communications networks, they sport particular
clothing, carry special equipment and they rally at preordained
locations. They are celeb-spotters.
For Lesley-Ann from Edinburgh and Gillian from Bishopbriggs, it
started with stake-outs at the SECC when Take That, East 17 or the like
were in Scotland: they would dog school and turn up in the middle of the
day hoping to catch ''the boys'' arriving for a soundcheck. Magically,
someone always seemed to know where the band would be staying, and after
each concert there would be a dash to mob the hotel hoping for an
autograph. Since STV started interviewing pop celebrities on its
Saturday morning What's Up Doc, there has been a regular meet outside
the TV studios at Cowcaddens at around 7.30am.
Sometimes bands will be snared as they emerge from an early flight
into Glasgow Airport or leaving a hotel for the studio. Then straight
after the programme which few fans can join -- most are pressed against
the cold plate glass windows for a couple of hours, jostling for a view
-- they will be mobbed again. Finally, the most dedicated swoop to the
bus station, racing back to the airport for a last interception.
Armed with cameras, good old fashioned autograph books, gifts and
perhaps a small tape recorder, the girls -- there is never a boy to be
seen -- are ready to stand for hours in all weathers, to befriend
strangers in the form of security or hotel personnel and to cast all
caution to the wind in furious attempts to gain a smile, a word or a hug
from their young heros.
A serious fan packs a bulky rucksack carefully. It contains a survival
kit of crisps, chewing gum, water, face-saving make-up, a magazine to
read while hanging about and a collection of pens including,
importantly, a permanent marker for celebs to autograph CD boxes,
photographs or even her jacket or jeans.
But why do they do it? Rosamund from Bridge of Allan displayed her
autograph book full of scribbled signatures. ''Celebs are so nice to
you,'' she explained. ''I know they want fans to buy their records, but
they're just so friendly.
''The best trophy is something they give to you -- even like a sweetie
wrapper -- but next best is a photo, then an autograph or a funny story
about them. Like, when I was at the airport to see Ant 'n' Dec this
person took my arm as I was trying to get close to the van and I thought
it was a security guard -- I looked round and realised I'd pushed past
Ant!''
Having met on a foray to the Top of the Pops studios at Elstree during
the schools October break, Lesley-Ann and Rosamund have become regular
penpals. Letter writing to a range of penpals is an important part of
the networking: information about sightings, about the bands' family
addresses and about forthcoming appearances and travel arrangements are
swopped for free. Although presumably each girl is dedicated to
achieving a personal encounter with the hero of the moment, they are
heartwarmingly open with the information they share with each other.
As an anxious parent, gleaning details of what occurs and striving to
insist on minimal standards of safety and contact with home, I have
affection and respect for this new community of friends: the more so
because it seems they often draw scorn, from adults, and even their peer
group.
Nothing daunted, like trainspotters turning their anoraks against the
wind and their faces up the tracks, the young celeb-spotters just put
fresh film in their cameras and set their alarm clocks for the dawn
call.
Of course, there are few worries, a few what-ifs: what-if they get
lured away by a maniac, what-if they get run over in the excitement,
what-if they get bloodied in a fight over a sweetie wrapper. But it's in
their interest to keep me happy: concerts cost ridiculous amounts of
money, especially when they want to see the same band several nights in
a row.
When lack of cash or other commitments intrude upon their plans, the
hobby reveals its darker side: it becomes an addiction. Deprivation can
result in withdrawal symptoms of flushed, sullen moodiness with the
incipient threat of violent temper tantrums or worse.
I ponder occasionally on how I might feel if the hobby persists. After
all, I've still got my Lennon poster on the wall and somewhere, at the
bottom of a drawer is a ragged fragment of the lining of George
Harrison's coat . . .

Composer Gavin Bryars resurfaces with another reworking of his Titanic
epic. Elizabeth Clark examines its 26-year evolution
RECOLLECTIONS from Harold Bride, the junior wireless operator aboard
the Titanic on the night of her tragic maiden voyage, April 15, 1912:
''From aft came the tunes of the band . . . the ship was gradually
turning on her nose . . . I guess of all the band went down.''
For British composer Gavin Bryars, the behaviour of the band became
the inspiration for his epic masterpiece, The Sinking Of The Titanic.
Since its first performance in 1969, the work has undergone constant
revision and comes to Edinburgh's Festival Theatre in its latest guise
this Saturday, the anniversary of the sinking of the ship.
Bryars experienced an unconventional musical training. Having achieved
Grade 8 Piano and A-level music while at school, he then went on to
study philosophy in Sheffield, not entirely the career path he'd
intended.
''I went to Sheffield originally to be a music student but I failed to
read the small print in the prospectus and couldn't do a single honours
music course. I had to adopt a modern language which I didn't want to do
so I became a philosophy student and a very bad one at that -- I just
graduated with a third class degree.''
After university, Bryars made a name for himself as a jazz bassist,
working with improvisers Tony Oxley and Derek Bailey. Having become
disillusioned with this kind of music, he then took up a teaching post
in a Portsmouth art college.
It was while working in the art college that Bryars made the first
sketches of The Sinking Of The Titanic, an experimental journey in
search of the musical equivalent of conceptual art. Initially, Bryars
looked to the behaviour of the band. ''The band in effect was the
starting point of the whole piece,'' he says. ''What they played, and
how they played it seemed to me to be of paramount importance.
''They played light music just to keep the people's spirits up and
make them think that everything was normal, but in the last five
minutes, they played this hymn and that seemed to me to be an incredibly
noble gesture. They were within minutes of dying, they had no chance of
survival and they just chose to play music.''
The hymn was the episcopal chorale, Autumn. Becoming as it has, the
musical core of his piece, what was the attraction? ''It's not a well
known hymn and the words have got nothing to do with death or imminent
loss of life -- in a way that made it all the more poignant. If they'd
played, as they were believed to have played, Nearer My God To Thee, it
would be slightly more banal, ultimately.
''It wouldn't have had the same point for me as having something that
is just the fields have been harvested in, we're gathering in all the
goods of the earth and so, I suppose there's the metaphor that God is
gathering in his own, but I don't think they'd be thinking that
sophisticated way at the time.''
As the band were never heard to stop playing, Bryars turned to
Marconi's belief that, given adequate technology, all previous sound can
be traced, and that it is, in effect, possible to hear Christ's seven
last words from the cross.
''With the notion of sound never dying and the fact that water is such
a sound efficient habitat, there was this idea that somewhere under the
waves this hymn tune is still bubbling round and round, chugging away in
some sort of strange, conceptual space.''
As well as the hymn tune, the latest version of the piece incorporates
sound bites of interviews with survivors, traces of Scottish and Irish
bagpipe music played on the ship and samples of morse code messages, all
of which will be performed by The Gavin Bryars Ensemble and the
Wenhaston Boys' Choir.
Avoiding conventional orchestral sound, Bryars employs electronics and
exciting manipulation of sound within various forms of acoustic space,
including fragments of previous recordings made in a water tower at
Bourges and an art noveau swimming pool in Brussels. To complete the
musical cycle, he projects the audience into an imaginary future where
the ship is refloated and the music returns to its original state.
Already 26 years old, how long can the piece continue to engage his
imagination? ''Anything new that happens about the Titanic can still
stimulate my interest. They've discovered an unopened sack of mail. That
would give you a picture of life on the ship through what people were
communicating back home or forward to America.''
So will the piece live as long as Bryars? ''I can see no point at
which I'd end the piece. I suppose if the Titanic were refloated and its
hulk was there as a floating museum that would square the circle.''
The Sinking Of The Titanic will be performed at Edinburgh's Festival
Theatre on Saturday at 7.30pm.
Elizabeth Clark produces Radio Scotland's The Usual Suspects, which
will profile Gavin Bryars, on Friday at 10.10pm.

<HEADLINE>Howard hails DNA database as major aid against crime</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>6</PAGE>
<GRAPHIC>ILLUS</GRAPHIC>
<RECORDNO>978944211</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
AUNIQUE DNA database came into operation yesterday and was hailed by
Home Secretary Michael Howard as the biggest breakthrough in the fight
against crime since fingerprints.
Under last year's Criminal Justice Act, police can, as of yesterday,
take non-intimate samples such as hair without consent, with the aim of
building up DNA details of all offenders.
Mr Howard said the database -- the first of its kind in the world --
would make a ''real difference'' in the detection of crime.
''It's the biggest breakthrough since fingerprints. This is a vital
area in the fight against crime where Britain is leading the world,'' he
said.
The new computerised database is part of a series of measures included
in the new Criminal Justice Act which abolishes the ''right to silence''
and gives additional stop and search powers to the police.
No decision about the setting up of a database for DNA testing has yet
been taken in Scotland, with its separate criminal justice system and
divergent legislation.
The Association of Chief Police Officers, (ACPO) has, however, set up
a committee to look at the ramifications of following the lead of
England and Wales.
A spokesman at the home affairs department of the Scottish Office said
yesterday that all forensic work was undertaken in Scotland by its own
forces, and university departments.
He added: ''It has to be understood that there is an awareness that
accused persons may be convicted on DNA results alone (in England and
Wales), when one of the basics of Scots law is corroboration.
''The matter is still under scrutiny.''
At a news conference in London, Mr Howard said: ''The package (as it
applies to England and Wales) is a combination of new laws, new
technology, and new rules which will gladden the police and public and
strike directly at criminals.''
He added: ''The Act as a whole is the most substantial and
far-reaching piece of criminal justice legislation for a generation.''
He claimed forensic scientists and senior police officers believed the
new database would reduce criminal behaviour and cut the cost of
investigating serious offences.
Police in England and Wales will now be able to take DNA samples from
anyone charged with a recordable offence -- these samples will be
retained on the data base at the Forensic Science Service laboratory in
Birmingham.
Mr Howard said about 135,000 samples are expected to be taken in the
first year alone from those charged with burglary, assault, and sexual
offences.
Eventually, up to five million records are likely to be held within
the system.
Mr Howard stressed that DNA profiles will be retained only if the
suspect was convicted of, or cautioned for what in England and Wales is
termed a recordable offence -- that is offences which can be on
indictment -- or if actions against the individual are on-going.
Information on people who are acquitted or where no criminal
proceedings are pursued, will not be retained and samples taken simply
for the purposes of elimination may not be used in speculative searches.
Yesterday, Mr Howard strongly defended the abolition of the right to
silence, which has been attacked by civil rights groups. He said: ''The
Act's provisions bring about a long overdue change in the law.''
The civil rights' organisation Liberty has warned that the move could
lead to more innocent people being harassed.
Mr Andrew Puddephatt, its general secretary, said: ''Liberty believes
that the right to silence is essential to uphold the presumption that
someone is innocent until proved guilty, guaranteed in international
human rights law.
''Police pressure, even within the bounds of legality, can produce
false confessions and unsafe convictions -- with abolition, additional
pressures will be placed on people in police detention,'' he said.
In England and Wales, the Act also bans bail for people charged with
rape, murder, or manslaughter who have been previously been convicted of
such offences.
The presumption in favour of bail is removed for a person charged with
a serious offence who was already on bail when the offence was
committed.
In addition, police can now attach conditions to police bail and they
have the power of immediate arrest of those who breach police bail.
A senior officer can authorise the use of stop and search powers by
police officers in uniform on pedestrians or vehicles for offensive
weapons. This allows police greater powers where before an officer would
have to have had reasonable grounds for suspecting he would find stolen
or prohibited articles.
Mr Puddephatt said the new powers could be used in a discriminatory
way against black people and that some of the provisions were
reminiscent of the controversial ''sus'' laws which operated across the
Border in the 1970s.
''Crime will not be reduced by harassing, arresting, and convicting
innocent people. These changes will undermine the relationship between
the police and sections of the community -- you cannot fight crime by
taking away people's rights.''
However, Mr Howard stressed that the powers were preventative and
hailed the implementation of all the latest measures as a significant
boost in the fight against crime.
''This means that 90% of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act is
now in force. This is a landmark piece of legislation,'' Mr Howard said.

* Seventeen-year-old Ewan MacDermid from Bearsden is the winner of
Radio 5 Live's Stop Press Young Campaigning Journalist of the Year
competition. Ewan is a sixth-year pupil at St Aloysius College, Glasgow.
Below is an edited version of his award-winning article.
IT'S eight o'clock on a wet Tuesday night and Joe's tenth visit to a
Glasgow health centre. Inside the consulting room there are a set of
baby scales, a child's height chart and several hundred hypodermic
needles. Assorted condoms are stacked carefully on the table along with
bottles of vitamins.
Joe, 27, is a drug abuser and is the target of a two-pronged campaign.
This involves the use of needle exchanges and the heroin substitute
Methadone, with the aim to stop the spread of HIV and Hepatitis among
addicts in Glasgow.
Joe explains: ''I was injecting Temazepam which glued up my veins. My
leg swelled up and gangrene nearly set in.'' He hopes to stop injecting
and is on the waiting list for a Methadone programme, which is
prescribed by doctors and dispensed by pharmacists.
The needle exchange is one of eight in Glasgow set up to help drug
abusers. According to Nursing Director John Cameron, it is a lifeline to
addicts who previously shared dirty needles and the infections, HIV and
Hepatitis, that go with them.
John Cameron also argues that the exchanges stop the spread of disease
in a wider sense by keeping dirty needles off the street and out of the
hands of children.
He said: ''The first exchange was set up at Ruchill Hospital as a
pilot project. Local residents vigorously opposed them because they were
worried that the exchanges would lead to dirty needles being discarded
on the streets, as well as an increase in crime and drug dealing.
''However, these arguments don't hold water, since we receive more
needles than we give out, and there is no evidence to show that the
exchanges encourage drug dealing. Dealers shy away from authority such
as the health service.''
Some drug abusers are reluctant to approach their GP because of their
drug problems, despite having horrific abscesses and blocked veins. John
Cameron pointed out that the scheme has been ''an informal introduction
to treatment''. However, his main argument is the drop in new HIV
infections from 4.6% of addicts in 1987 to 1.1% in 1994.
Opposition has come from some GPs who are reluctant to prescribe
Methadone, arguing it is substituting one problem for another. Some GPs
also regard addicts as demanding, time-consuming and manipulative
patients. Psychiatrists fear that addicts can become hooked on
Methadone.
However, Dr Laurence Gruer, HIV and Addiction Director with Greater
Glasgow Health Board, believes the previous absence of a Methadone
programme in Glasgow has left the city ''seriously deficient'' in its
fight to control the spread of Aids.
Now GPs have been recruited and pharmacists dispense measures of
Methadone. If the programme is successful the addicts will be taken off
dangerous injecting habits and the dealers who trade in illicit drugs
will be by-passed.
But critics believe that the needle exchanges and the Methadone
programme are partly to blame for the record number of 96 drugs-related
deaths in Strathclyde last year. Glasgow is Strathclyde's largest city
with just under half the region's population.
Most vocal is Maxie Richards who believes that the exchanges encourage
addiction. ''There have been too many drugs-related deaths, and we
cannot address this by simply providing needle exchanges.
''We should provide a programme of care and encouragement to get
people off drugs.''
Maxie Richards runs the Maxie Richards Foundation which provides a
system of care to get addicts off drugs. This has included taking
addicts into her home in a middle-class suburb of Glasgow.
''Needle exchanges collecting needles may prevent the spread of Aids
but so would getting people to come off drugs and that would have a more
permanent and positive effect.''
She rebuts criticism that she is too idealistic. ''It only needs time,
money and a change of attitude in society towards drug use. We have
become far too tolerant of something which is killing our young
people.''
In the meantime people like Joe keep turning up at the needle
exchanges and John Cameron and his colleagues try to make the best of
the situation.

Choreographer Shobana Jeyasingh has set out to raid the world of
sport. Mary Brennan looks at how dance can foray for new ideas and
breach barriers
ALONE figure darts into the other side's home territory and tries, by
agility and guile, to touch each of seven opponents without once being
tackled. And all the while, chanting over and over, the name of the
game: Kabbadi. Kabbadi.
The ''invasion'' lasts as long as the invader can hold one single
breath. When the lungs are scratching for air, it's time to escape back,
across the border to one's own side or be captured. The pace is fierce,
the action full of dodging and scrummaging, quick-witted tactics and
quick-kicking moves.
Kabbadi was, still is, a street game played in Indian towns and
villages. These days it has the status of a national sport and can -- of
a Saturday morning -- be viewed on Channel 4. It is also the inspiration
behind Shobana Jeyasingh's latest dance piece, Raid, which comes to the
MacRobert Centre, Stirling, tomorrow.
As she describes the fascinating power shifts within the game -- who
exactly is attacking or defending at any given moment -- Shobana
Jeyasingh begins to identify just why she has used a sport for the bones
of a dance. In part, it's because Kabbadi deals in issues of territory
and that is a topic which acts within her imagination, like grit in an
oyster.
''It has wonderful metaphors for someone who's left home,'' she says,
with a little laugh. ''Because everthing that happens is all done in
someone else's territory. It's like making your artistic home in someone
else's space.'' Which is, of course, what she herself has done for the
last 20 years.
Not unlike the spirited lone raiders of Kabbadi, Shobana Jeyasingh has
crossed perceived borders in order to achieve her own choreographic
locus.
En route, she has been pounced on by purists who feel that she is
somehow betraying the classical dance traditions of her native India --
and annexed by others who hail her as a talisman of East-West fusion.
If the former make her sigh with their restrictive concepts, the
latter make her distinctly growly. growl. The very notion that she is
fusing anything invites a peremptory short-circuit in her customary
courtesy.
Jeyasingh -- like any other contemporary dance maker -- uses movements
that please her, movements that accord with ideas she has or with music
she wants to use. No-one accuses a white choreographer who dips into
Butoh of somehow expressing a hidden yen to be Japanese.
And so it irks her that, because of the colour of her skin, she is
automatically assumed to be campaigning for the updating of Indian dance
culture, or flying the flag for Pan-groovy crossover work.
''If I have a mission,'' she says dryly, ''it's to make good dance.
Not to be hijacked, made part of someone else's agenda. And that happens
very easily when you're not white. People make assumptions on your
behalf.
''They will ask me, for instance, when I am going to take my dance
back to India. Back? As if, even after 20 years of living in London,
working here, that India is where my roots -- my inclinations -- must
be.'' Her voice is tinged with a mix of exasperation and intelligent
amusement.
She goes on: ''In fact, we are going to Jacob's Pillow -- (the
prestigious American dance festival) -- which is, you could say, a kind
of roots for contemporary dance. And we are going because the work
belongs there, if anywhere!''
Her conversation, like her choreography, is thoroughly invigorating,
because Jeya-singh doesn't deal in junk thinking. While Raid works as
physical, exciting dance, it also operates on a host of pleasing
symbolic levels.
Alongside the whole area of territory, with its attendant issues of
national identity, custom and possession, run other thoughts.
Why, for instance, do we separate out sport and dance as if one were
an accessible, down-to-earth, realistic use of the trained body's grace,
athleticism and strength, and the other were some unreal, magical, even
out-of-reach deployment of the same muscles, bones, skills?
A bit more foraying into each other's territories and who knows what
new visions might emerge! The name of that game, surely, has to be
Shobana Jeyasingh.

FIRST, an award for public spiritedness to the man from the audience
who held a microphone to Natalie MacMaster's fiddle when her pick-up
went dead, a job akin to following the ball at a tennis match. At least
she was sitting down at the time.
She doesn't do a lot of sitting down. Nor does she do much standing
still. MacMaster comes from Cape Breton, where Scottish music has been
preserved, it's been said, and there seems little argument, in the
spirit of old, pre-gentrification, before it was White Heather Clubbed
into politeness.
Over there they play, not for meekly tapping your feet to, but for
getting up and having a real old leap around. Mostly MacMaster gets so
involved with playing for the leaping around that she leaps around too.
Well, not quite leaps around. This is serious step dancing. Intricate.
Athletic. And all the time she'll be playing fiddle with that
irresistible blend of enthusiasm and virtuosity. Percussive slurs,
superfast arpeggios, and hard-edged, damn near heavy metal attack are
her stock in trade.
Over at the piano Tracey Dares sits puffing a breeze into her fringe,
pumping out accompaniments that are one part Jim MacLeod to nine parts
Jerry Lee Lewis. Bass players beware: with her busy, roving, and
mischievous left-hand parts, she'll put you out of business.
Don't ask them to name that tune, they won't know. They have great
memories, they say, but short ones. Some are jigs, some reels, some
strathspeys.
Some are marches learned from MacMaster's Uncle Buddy (''Buddy the
Master''), one of the great Cape Breton fiddlers. Some are slow airs
played with a vibrato as wide as the Clyde and a passion as intense as a
blues guitar solo or a jazz saxophone ballad.
You think I'm bluffing? Well, here's the commercial. Call it a favour.
MacMaster and Dares are playing at the Riverside Club in Glasgow,
tonight, and at the Beach Ballroom in Aberdeen on Wednesday. Go along.
They'll be nice to you. They even tell you when you should yell
''yeuch'' (which is pretty much all the time). But if you can work out
how MacMaster can keep playing such great fiddle while one leg is
pogoing and the other is whirling round from the knee down, please let
me know.

IN Twelfth Night, Shakespeare is at his most playful, and if we
imagine the original, in which boys played girls playing boys, beloved
by women themselves played by boys, we see a hall of mirrors more
dizzying than anything Joe Orton offered.
At the play's heart is love as the driving force of life and Ian
Judge's clear-headed production, for the Royal Shakespeare Company, lets
the actors tell it like it is, going full tilt for comedy without
sacrificing an ounce of pathos.
Here are all the essentials: Emma Fielding's Viola is boyish and
credible as Sebastian's twin. Clive Woods' Orsino is brimming with
suppressed lust; Olivia or Cesario, either or both would do.
You sense his palpable relief at discovering that his ruby-lipped
pageboy is a girl. Phew.
His relief is echoed only by Haydn Gwynne's Olivia, who is able
swiftly to release herself from mourning at the first sight of a
well-turned ankle.
Charming as the lovers all are, Shakespeare reserves his laughter for
the rest of humanity, trapped by their age or habit into follies whereby
they are deluded and unlovable.
The mischevious Maria, the drunkard Toby Belch, the halfwit Aguecheek
are splendid foils to Desmond Barrit's monumental Malvolio.
Has there ever been a Malvolio whose smile is so clearly a grimace
drawn from the jaws of hell itself, or one on whom daffodil yellow
stockings sit so mournfully?
Yet when he is humiliated, he cannot have our pity long, exploding in
frenzy of vengeful rage. This Malvolio is a thoroughly nasty, bombastic,
puritan. Magnificent. As for Derek Griffith's Feste, he is Shakespeare's
Motley personified. Wry, cool, melancholy, grasping, with a voice like a
bee on the wing.

BY the shores of a dark sea loch in the West Highlands, there is a
cairn commemorating a historic event. A legend on a silver plaque
informs visitors that it was here, beneath the towering grandeur of
Sgurr Coire Choinnichean, that the Seven Men of Knoydart rebelled
against an English laird in 1948 and staked claims to live and work on
the land of their forebears.
It concludes: ''Their struggle should inspire each new generation of
Scots to gain such rights by just laws. History will judge harshly the
oppressive laws that have led to the virtual extinction of a unique
culture from this beautiful place.''
The sentiments are noble, but the hopes proved forlorn. The Seven Men
were denounced as agitators, and evicted from their ancestral homeland
like their forebears before them. The laws which permit the wealthy to
acquire vast tracts of land for personal recreation or profit are still
in place, and the Gaelic-speaking Highlanders are long gone.
Where a thousand people once lived on the Knoydart peninsula from
farming and fishing, barely 50 survive on a fragile economy largely
dependent on a 16,500-acres sporting estate. Apart from a handful of
Scots employed by the estate, most of the residents are English settlers
attracted by the wild beauty of the remote land over the sea from Skye.
Its tranquillity and charms are preserved by its isolation. There are
no roads to Inverie, the little village of whitewashed houses and
cottages straggling along the northern shore of Loch Nevis. Westerly
gales permitting, a passenger ferry makes the 45-minute trip from
Mallaig three times a week; the alternative is to walk a pony track
through the hills from the nearest road 18 miles away at Kinloch Hourn.
As there are only seven miles of paved road which don't really go
anywhere, there are just a few mud-spattered four-wheel-drive vehicles
and nobody bothers with road tax or MOT tests. The village has, however,
a shop, a post office, an excellent guest house, and a hostelry listed
in the Guinness Book of Records as the most remote pub in mainland
Britain.
Humans have made little impression on this natural wilderness. It is
still the domain of the golden eagle, the red deer, and the otter, in
which the silence of the hills is disturbed only by birdsong and the
rushing of Highland burns. Mists swirling around the forests and
snow-streaked peaks in winter create a mystical illusion that one has
stepped back in time into a land of Celtic legends.
Knoydart seems far removed from the financial crisis and boardroom
wrangles of its present owner, the Dundee-based Titaghur jute company,
but it is deeply affected by them. The outcome of a take-over bid will
determine in large measure the fate of its little community.
For months, reports that the company was deeply in debt and likely to
sell off its Highland estate have been the talk of Inverie. The arrival
of a management consultant to survey its assets in Knoydart last week
fuelled rumours that a change of ownership was imminent. It had much the
same effect, in a similar setting, as the arrival of the oil company
representative in the film Local Hero.
Dave Smith, the chairman of the community association, confided to The
Herald that he and others were plotting a take-over bid of their own if
Knoydart came on the market. ''The sooner Titaghur are out of here the
better,'' he said. ''From the start, they have been making promises and
breaking them. Now the time may be ripe to change the whole system of
ownership.''
Ironically, this talk of rebellion took place beside the cairn to the
Seven Men outside the village hall. But instead of Gaelic, it was
expressed in the accent of the Home Counties, from which Mr Smith came
almost 30 years ago to farm sheep and cattle in a remote corner of the
peninsula; and unlike the original Scots rebels, Mr Smith has
influential friends.
''The laird system does not provide stability any more, and there is a
strong feeling that the community should have more say in running the
estate,'' he said. ''It's probably too big for a single body, but we
have many friends who could help set up a partnership with a
conservation group, for example. We have done some groundwork and if the
estate comes up for sale I think a packet will come together fairly
quickly.''
Mr Smith declined to identify the community's friends, but apparently
they include absentee property owners such as Lord and Lady Craigmyle
who spend the summer months in their house at the western end of the
loch.
But opinion is sharply divided on the issue. Dave Marriott from
Nottingham, the community vice-chairman and affable proprietor of the
guest house, is sceptical. ''Of course people are anxious, because we
don't know if the next owner could be a pop star or an Arab or a
politician. But I don't think a community buy-out would work. It would
create greed and jealousy among close neighbours, and I can see all
sorts of fights and fall-outs.''
Mr Marriott's view, which seems to have some support, is that there
have already been squabbles over less critical matters and that communal
ownership of the estate would strain relations further.
The most contentious issue during Titaghur's reign has been a scheme
for an adventure training school for deprived youngsters. The ''back to
basics'' programme was shelved after only two short courses last year
when it aroused bitter opposition -- much of it from the absentee
property owners. Mr Marriott and his wife Jan, from Glasgow, who spoke
in favour of the project, were subjected to discreet threats of boycotts
and eviction.
Such conflicts are viewed sourly by John Morrison, one of the few
resident Scots who farms a few head of North-Country Cheviots near the
village. ''It was mostly the incomers who were against the youngsters
coming up here,'' he says. ''They had a meeting in the hall and people
were speaking against it you'd hardly seen here for 10 years. When they
voted against it, they put men's jobs at risk and deprived these
youngsters of a fresh start in life.''
Mr Morrison, who came to Knoydart from Harris in 1961 with his father
and two brothers to work on the estate, admits he is ''a bit of a
hardliner''. He views with distaste the corporate trading of the
peninsula and laments the passing of the Highland way of life.
''In the old days at least you knew who the owners were, now it's just
companies and you don't know who they are. If you go to a meeting in the
hall, there'll hardly be a Scotsman in the place. It's like a lot of
Highland communities, where the old ways go down the drain. Everything
traditional here is finished. It's not just sad, it's devastating.''
One man determined to revitalise Knoydart if he gets the chance is
Mike Reynolds, a former Army officer appointed by Titaghur to manage the
estate. His enthusiasm for the adventure school project has brought him
under more fire than he encountered in Northern Ireland with the King's
Own Scottish Borderers, but he is regrouping his forces for another
attempt.
''We don't want this to be just an exclusive retreat for rich
outsiders,'' he says. ''I want to give young people from Drumchapel and
Easterhouse the same opportunity to enjoy these magnificent
surroundings, and to benefit from them. All we're trying to do is to put
back into their lives what they have been missing, a family, a community
spirit, and self-confidence. At the same time it would be good to inject
youth into the community, and provide jobs that would appeal to other
young people.''
Mr Reynolds admits that Titaghur made a tactical error at the start by
failing to secure the co-operation of residents, but hopes he can still
persuade them that limited numbers of ''problem'' youths would not
disturb their tranquillity. He has been given permission by the regional
council to proceed with groups of not more than a dozen, providing he
does so tactfully, and he is negotiating with local authorities in
Scotland and England who are interested in sending young people in their
care.
Neil Morrison from Aberdeenshire is above such disputes, in the
literal sense. As hill-keeper for the estate, he spends most of his time
in the highlands he loves, looking after 700 stags and an equal number
of hinds and calves. He does not get involved in local intrigues,
because they are of no interest to him.
''It's the high rugged hills that keep me here,'' he says. ''I can
spend a whole day among them and never see anybody. I never get tired of
looking at the deer, they're bonnie beasts, aren't they?''
A dozen stags are clustered near his Land Rover, nervously snatching
at the winter feed he has brought them. The wild grass is pale in the
mist, discoloured by patches of heather still wearing its brown winter
coat, and high above a lark is trilling. In the distance, a shaft of
sunlight transforms a dark loch into a ribbon of brilliant silver.
Mr Morrison points out that Knoydart is bounded by Loch Nevis (Loch of
Heaven) and Loch Hourn (Loch of Hell). ''So we're half-way between
heaven and hell here,'' he says. ''But up here, I think we're closer to
heaven.''
It would be misleading to suggest that life below in Inverie is
anything remotely resembling hell. For all their differences, the
residents are basically courteous, good-natured folk who have created a
sociable community others would envy. The window of the estate office
last week was adorned with posters for an Easter bonnet competition, a
treasure hunt, and a ceilidh in the village hall. All of them will be
well attended.
But something has gone from Knoydart which may never be recovered,
whatever new corporate strategy emerges for managing it. The young lad
from Lochaber who conveyed me back to Mallaig in a forestry launch knew
little of the history of the peninsula, and even less about the
boardroom battles over its future.
But glancing back at the properties of absentee owners along the
shore, he said: ''It's a shame tae see a' these nice houses empty.'' It
is a sentiment the Seven Men of Knoydart would share.

THE get-up-and-go so essential for the dedicated sportsperson is
something New York Ruthie has always lacked, tending to nod off while
playing or watching anything.
It has cost her friends, this habit, and much ignominy. At high school
she was the one drummed out of the co-ed softball team for making daisy
chains while fielding.
But now comes the most curious news. New York Ruthie is inclining
towards body-building, not just out of a seasonal desire to be beach-fit
by summer but because Luis, her Cuban husband, happened to mention that
compared to Latin women Ruthie was a little light around the calves.
A couple of years ago her tango teacher mentioned as much during her
weedy championship performance at the Cuba Libre, but Ruthie passed that
off as his dissatisfaction with any woman, other than his erstwhile
pupil, Rita Moreno.
Luis's comment couldn't be so easily dismissed. He has five sisters
and a mother all with beautifully developed leg muscles from doing the
pasa doble probably from birth. It was Cary Grant who once remarked that
the woman who seeks attention by the extent of her cleavage has no
security at all. At the time he was referring to Mae West whose cleavage
by then was not so much one of the natural wonders of the world as one
of its silicon valleys.
Still, in Ruthie's mind, only a bout of intensive bench-pressing and
duels with resistance machines would rectify her particular situation.
Better the torture of that than perhaps allowing inadequate calves to
wreck her marriage.
So now, like every other member of her work-out class, she possesses
the glazed focus of a fanatic hell-bent on inflating every other contour
of the body to become a landscape glistening with taught hills and glens
of flesh. As a result she is utterly oblivious of the fact that there is
more of a Francis Bacon look to her person than Luis might care to see.
But that's the way of body-building.
What begins as moderate weight training turns into a craving for the
shoulder boulders of a stevedore.
Ruthie's group meets every morning at 7am in a sports depot on East
48th Street and among its number is one woman whose neck ripples with
such definition she might as well have a string of sausages implanted
beneath the skin. She once told Ruthie that her reason for taking up
dumbbells was an answer to a dying father. But that still doesn't
completely explain the strangeness of this yearning among women for
brawn of their own.
Seeking enlightenment Ruthie recently wrote to Arnold Schwarzenegger,
the closest thing man has to thinking beefcake -- which just about says
everything while saying nothing much at all. Anyway, Schwarzie baby --
who knows of Ruthie through her production work on movies -- replied
that, in his experience, women were tired of being fobbed off with
frivolous physical exercise regimes which failed to give ''measurable''
results. In other words they were seeking equality in everything, life,
love, and gymnasiums.
It was at this point in their correspondence that Ruthie raised her
own concern: ''Arnie, I have to tell you,'' she wrote, ''that my chest
is impressive but my lower legs remain anonymous. What can I do?'' Flex,
strike, and strut. Flex, strike, and strut . . . Not given to elaborate
syntax, this was the brawn guru's terse advice, and accordingly Ruthie,
the Ironheart, can now boast Navratilova muscles popping out, firm as
lemons, behind each shin.
Meanwhile two of her classmates have moved into the wilder
stranglehold of female wrestling. Punching breasts is out, of course,
otherwise the rules remain the same as for men.
If there is a specific problem, Ruthie says, it is one of dress:
''When the corsetry breaks at an inopportune moment there is no use
asking an opponent to take five while you mend a strap.''
Where is Luis in all of this? Down in the gym alongside the rest of
them, the lust for monstrous physique being furiously contagious. ''It's
performance art,'' he says, attempting to haul this swell of shaky
self-love on to the bandwagon of fashion. And with muscles primed in the
most surprising places Ruthie and he now seem ready for the steamy
dramas of international competitions. But hark, from around the corner
come the clicks and groans of another kind of future: in a solemn white
coat the long-term osteopath is beckoning.

Geraldine Abrahams reports on a new business ideology to Britain which
is presently sweeping the US and Japan
JUST over 20 years ago, almost every district attorney in the US voted
to make franchising illegal. Many people were suspicious of the concept,
and the media at that time had a field day, running stories about
families made destitute by shaky franchising schemes. If larger
organisations like McDonald's and various others had not stood firm
against the onslaught, it is unlikely that franchising would have
survived.
Today franchises account for 35% of all retail sales in the US and
franchising is considered to be a perfectly acceptable way of doing
business.
The struggle to promote network marketing, an even newer business
ideology, as an equally acceptable form of business can be compared
directly with the battle fought for franchising in the early 1970s.
Network marketing is a method of distributing goods from the
manufacturer to the consumer. It was started in the US back in 1941 by
Dr Carl Rehnberg, a chemist, who invented a new food supplement and sold
it through his own company Nutrilite Products Inc., operating a system
which allowed ordinary people to build sales networks that continued to
produce income even after they had retired from the business. Today,
Nutrilite is a subsidiary of the Amway Corporation.
While network marketing is now well established in the US and Japan,
it is still relatively young in this country, although there are several
successful UK-based companies like Cabouchon, Petroleum and Kleeneze.
This success is measured in terms of the products they offer, their
value for money, and the fact that the operators enjoy their work. While
a full-time income can be made from working on a full-time basis, most
reputable network marketing companies advise an initial part-time
involvement.
As in all types of business system, network marketing has its share of
unethical practitioners and people should be wary of the ''get rich
quick'' enticements offered by some unscrupulous companies.
Tom McCay, a firm believer in network marketing, has been involved for
several years. While he readily recognises the success of responsible
companies, he urges caution when choosing which network to join.
''Don't be fooled by what anyone tells you on a one-to-one
presentation at home,'' he advises. ''Go and do your own research.
Telephone Companies' House and find out if the company is registered,
find out who the directors are and about the share capital of that
company.
''Phone the Office of Fair Trading and find out if the company's
Marketing Plan is legal and ethical. It will be governed by the 1973
Pyramid Selling Act, which was designed to protect people against
illegal scams.
''Even before you check out the company, ask yourself if you would buy
the product and if the answer is no, then don't get involved.
''If the perceived product is not really a product at all but rather a
con passing money around an illegal matrix of people, for example, where
you are asked to part with #250 cash, ask yourself the question: 'If you
are going to turn around that #250 cash into #1,600 net profit in two
days as is sometimes promised, who is going to lose it?' For a profit of
no perceived value, there has to be a loser somewhere.''
According to McCay, network marketing is not about making quick money.
It is a slow, ethical, legal and very enjoyable process.
There are companies operating in Scotland today which persuade people
to part with #250/#300 to join the network, or pyramid. One company
sells vouchers to the value of #250 but it is necessary immediately to
spend a further #110 plus various other extras which are initially
excluded.
Other people are persuaded to join and when the top of the pyramid has
been reached the person who paid the initial #250 receives #2000 in
total from the #250 payments made by each of the eight people at the
bottom of the pyramid. Since the vouchers from the company only cost
#400, the net profit is #1600. Logically, the system will eventually run
out of people who will be willing to pass over the #250.
Successful network marketing is about changing people's buying habits.
It is not only about making money, although that is often the major
reason for people becoming involved in the first place.
Most reputable network marketing companies hold training sessions at
least once a week, every week. These involve both business training and
personal development.
Says Tom McCay: ''At the end of the day, all reputable network
marketing companies will tell you that you cannot succeed until you help
the people you bring in. The secret of success in life is helping other
people, giving value for money and this training helps you do that.
''The most successful network marketers in the world today are not
super salesmen, but those who come from a teaching or nursing background
because they are caring people. That is a documented fact.''
He suggests that those people who are interested should decide which
network they like best and make sure the product is genuine. While there
is a lot of public speaking involved eventually, it is not necessary to
become a public speaker to be successful in network marketing, although
it is often a natural evolution.
Like franchising, network marketing has a laid down plan but because
the entry point is so low -- usually about #25, and is therefore more
available to the ordinary person, a lot of people get involved who
should not. Tom McCay has refused many people because they want to join
for the wrong reasons.
Conversely, for those people who are purely motivated and prepared to
work at it, within a reputable company, the rewards are plentiful.
Information about network marketing can be found in advertisements in
the business section of the general press or in specialist business
magazines like Business Age, one of Britain's best selling business
magazines.

LUXEMBOURG: The European Union agreed to ask Iran to declare that it

threat for alleged blasphemy of Islam. A message to Tehran will be
delivered this week.

Geraldine Abrahams reports on a new business ideology to Britain which
is presently sweeping the US and Japan
JUST over 20 years ago, almost every district attorney in the US voted
to make franchising illegal. Many people were suspicious of the concept,
and the media at that time had a field day, running stories about
families made destitute by shaky franchising schemes. If larger
organisations like McDonald's and various others had not stood firm
against the onslaught, it is unlikely that franchising would have
survived.
Today franchises account for 35% of all retail sales in the US and
franchising is considered to be a perfectly acceptable way of doing
business.
The struggle to promote network marketing, an even newer business
ideology, as an equally acceptable form of business can be compared
directly with the battle fought for franchising in the early 1970s.
Network marketing is a method of distributing goods from the
manufacturer to the consumer. It was started in the US back in 1941 by
Dr Carl Rehnberg, a chemist, who invented a new food supplement and sold
it through his own company Nutrilite Products Inc., operating a system
which allowed ordinary people to build sales networks that continued to
produce income even after they had retired from the business. Today,
Nutrilite is a subsidiary of the Amway Corporation.
While network marketing is now well established in the US and Japan,
it is still relatively young in this country, although there are several
successful UK-based companies like Cabouchon, Petroleum and Kleeneze.
This success is measured in terms of the products they offer, their
value for money, and the fact that the operators enjoy their work. While
a full-time income can be made from working on a full-time basis, most
reputable network marketing companies advise an initial part-time
involvement.
As in all types of business system, network marketing has its share of
unethical practitioners and people should be wary of the ''get rich
quick'' enticements offered by some unscrupulous companies.
Tom McCay, a firm believer in network marketing, has been involved for
several years. While he readily recognises the success of responsible
companies, he urges caution when choosing which network to join.
''Don't be fooled by what anyone tells you on a one-to-one
presentation at home,'' he advises. ''Go and do your own research.
Telephone Companies' House and find out if the company is registered,
find out who the directors are and about the share capital of that
company.
''Phone the Office of Fair Trading and find out if the company's
Marketing Plan is legal and ethical. It will be governed by the 1973
Pyramid Selling Act, which was designed to protect people against
illegal scams.
''Even before you check out the company, ask yourself if you would buy
the product and if the answer is no, then don't get involved.
''If the perceived product is not really a product at all but rather a
con passing money around an illegal matrix of people, for example, where
you are asked to part with #250 cash, ask yourself the question: 'If you
are going to turn around that #250 cash into #1,600 net profit in two
days as is sometimes promised, who is going to lose it?' For a profit of
no perceived value, there has to be a loser somewhere.''
According to McCay, network marketing is not about making quick money.
It is a slow, ethical, legal and very enjoyable process.
There are companies operating in Scotland today which persuade people
to part with #250/#300 to join the network, or pyramid. One company
sells vouchers to the value of #250 but it is necessary immediately to
spend a further #110 plus various other extras which are initially
excluded.
Other people are persuaded to join and when the top of the pyramid has
been reached the person who paid the initial #250 receives #2000 in
total from the #250 payments made by each of the eight people at the
bottom of the pyramid. Since the vouchers from the company only cost
#400, the net profit is #1600. Logically, the system will eventually run
out of people who will be willing to pass over the #250.
Successful network marketing is about changing people's buying habits.
It is not only about making money, although that is often the major
reason for people becoming involved in the first place.
Most reputable network marketing companies hold training sessions at
least once a week, every week. These involve both business training and
personal development.
Says Tom McCay: ''At the end of the day, all reputable network
marketing companies will tell you that you cannot succeed until you help
the people you bring in. The secret of success in life is helping other
people, giving value for money and this training helps you do that.
''The most successful network marketers in the world today are not
super salesmen, but those who come from a teaching or nursing background
because they are caring people. That is a documented fact.''
He suggests that those people who are interested should decide which
network they like best and make sure the product is genuine. While there
is a lot of public speaking involved eventually, it is not necessary to
become a public speaker to be successful in network marketing, although
it is often a natural evolution.
Like franchising, network marketing has a laid down plan but because
the entry point is so low -- usually about #25, and is therefore more
available to the ordinary person, a lot of people get involved who
should not. Tom McCay has refused many people because they want to join
for the wrong reasons.
Conversely, for those people who are purely motivated and prepared to
work at it, within a reputable company, the rewards are plentiful.
Information about network marketing can be found in advertisements in
the business section of the general press or in specialist business
magazines like Business Age, one of Britain's best selling business
magazines.

IMISSED the Tory rout in the Scottish local elections last Thursday.
Whoever fixed the date forgot that some of us had Easter holiday breaks
for the kids to organise. Maybe they had been taking lessons in timing
from the BBC's London hierarchy.
But, by Sunday, I was on my way to Japan and an electoral outcome
every bit as seismic as that delivered the length and breadth of
Scotland a few days before. In weekend local elections for governors of
two cities, Tokyo and Osaka, the Japanese people told the established
political parties exactly what they thought of them.
In both gupernatorial races, voters decisively elected what the CNN
network called a pair of comedians. It was a slight exaggeration. But
substantially correct.
In Tokyo, the victor was Yukio Aoshima, a 62-year-old former comedy TV
script writer and one-time actor. His most famous role was apparently
the heroine in a show called Mean Grandma. Now he heads the local
government administration for an area covering nearly 12 million people.
In Osaka, the new governor really was a comedian. Sixty-three-year-old
''Knock'' Yokoyama was part of a comedy trio in the 1960s. Now, after a
landslide victory against a former vice-minister, he has the challenge
of running a prefecture with a population of nearly nine million.
The political establishment here is in a state of profound shock. ''A
revolutionary incident,'' one Social Democratic member of the Upper
House told me yesterday. ''It's unprecedented,'' admitted a leading
representative of the other main government coalition partner, the
Liberal Democratic Party, later.
Both men, from very different perspectives, readily conceded that the
mainstream parties completely failed to respond to the popular mood.
''They are telling us they don't trust us. They are refuting the
political system as it exists in Japan today,'' said my SDP contact,
himself a long-standing critic of the present coalition.
The two new governors are not political virgins. Both men have served
in the Upper House for more than 20 years. But the platforms on which
they stood this time said little about what they plan to do with their
new-found metropolitan power bases.
Aoshima, who defeated a man who, until February, was Japan's top
bureaucrat, simply accused the main parties of colluding in their choice
of candidate and refused to campaign, apart from a few TV speeches. His
only pledges are to halt a major international trade show planned for
reclaimed land in Tokyo Bay next year and to refuse local subsidy to
bail out two ailing local banks.
Yokoyama, operating from a closed-down noodle shop by bicycle and
canvassing voters in the public bath tub, stressed his clean image and
mercilessly attacked the financial corruption and scandal which has
dogged mainstream politics in Japan in recent years.
It's as if Screaming Lord Sutch actually won on one of the Monster
Raving Loony Party's by-election outings. But mainstream politicians in
the UK would be well advised not to adopt a ''couldn't-happen-here''
attitude to the comedians' coup in Japan.
Of course there are factors unique to any political system. Japanese
opinion is still fretting over the speed of the official response to the
Great Hanshin earthquake (despite the devastated bullet train line
already being back up and running within three months). The subway gas
attack has further unsettled the public. Recessionary influences still
linger and the ever-appreciating Yen is putting serious strains on
Japanese exporters.
But the common factor -- one which victorious Labour as well as the
squashed Scottish Tories would do well to reflect on -- is what happens
to political parties when they take the electorate for granted for too
long.
I gather that, in the wake of last week's debacle, the Scottish Tory
President Sir Michael Hirst was unwise enough to attack voters for their
lack of gratitude.
He should have joined us last Wednesday in the Mock Turtle tearoom,
tucked away behind an unseasonally sunny Brighton seafront. As the kids
and I tucked into our cream tea we couldn't help but overhear the voices
of Middle England raised at the next table.
He was retired. Possibly ex-Army or ex-something in the City. He had
been devouring his Daily Mail. He was indubitably a lifelong Tory voter.
She arrived, having bought a newspaper, thinking she would be taking tea
alone. They were both regulars and quickly fell into conversation.
As they talked his disgruntlement became starkly evident. He
fulminated against ''those bankers sacking thousands of staff so they
can make bigger profits and boost their own bonuses''. He thundered
against bureaucracy, in general citing an 85-year-old female
acquaintance threatened with jail if she didn't comply with a
refurbishment order on her home. Both were contemptuous of a society
which thinks the best thing for 50-somethings is a redundancy programme.
''These young people come in and the likes of my sister get pushed
out,'' said she, with real feeling.
There was more, much more, along the same lines. These were the south
coast equivalents of the disenchanted voters of Tokyo and Osaka. Fed up
to the back teeth with politicians of every hue. Despairing of finding
anyone with a real solution to what they see as Britain's manifest
problems.
The last thing they want is to be told they are ungrateful. They may
not yet have thought of voting for a comedian. But they see the
political process as a sick joke. Even in the aftermath of its stunning
Scottish victory, that's as much a warning for Tony Blair's Labour Party
as it is for the bedraggled ranks of Scottish Tories.

MAY I reassure Councillor Thornton that I never doubted the existence
of an East Dunbarton Conservative policy on education? My point was that
the general public were, and still are, blissfully unaware of it (April
6).
I can also assure her that I did in fact receive a clear answer from
the Liberal Democrats: their policy is to appoint a director of
education and an education committee. It is my understanding that Labour
also incline towards this view. It is therefore a matter of some relief
that education is not to become a branch of social work or indeed parks
and cemeteries.
The matter has, of course, now been overtaken by events, as the voters
of Milngavie and Bearsden have delivered a resounding vote of confidence
in their Liberal Democrat councillors by electing Liberal Democrats in
nine of the 10 wards.
The question of Conservative education policy in local government has
now joined the other great unanswered questions like, ''Who was William
Shakespeare?'', ''What happened to the Mary Celeste?'', and ''Where is
Lord Lucan?''. In other words, it has been consigned by the electorate
to the realms of history.

GIVEN the recent legal action taken by the Labour Party and others to
block the broadcasting in Scotland of the Prime Minister's interview on
Panorama, I was surprised to learn of Donald Dewar's participation in
Westminster On-Line on the very day of our local elections (April 7).
This strikes me as blatant hypocrisy. It certainly does not reflect
his pious, gloating words on Newsnight after the interdict was granted.
I believe that the BBC is big enough and good enough to decide what to
broadcast and when to broadcast it. Donald Dewar, however, seems only to
think that when it suits him.

THE order by Dr John Markland, Fife region's chief executive, to
remove the Saltire from Carnock Primary School during the local
elections is an absolute disgrace (April 7).
For the so-called Scottish Labour Party to object to the flying of our
national flag on an election day is a sad indictment of the insecurity
of this political party and its pretensions towards the establishment of
a Scottish parliament and our subsequent reclaimed national identity.
I shudder to think what flag will fly over the Edinburgh parliament if
the Labour Party has anything to say on the matter. I refuse to believe
any official objection would have been lodged if the Union flag had been
flying at the school on polling day.
It is a matter of concern that the Labour Party feels it is necessary
to lower the Saltire for a day on the strength that it might dupe the
electorate into voting for, presumably, the Scottish National Party. We
should be positively encouraging public buildings to fly our flag as
often as possible and in this case I believe the occasion was entirely
appropriate as well as providing a distinctive and practical
''signpost'' for the polling place.
The commendable efforts of Carnock Primary School's pupils in winning
the Saltire through a competition run by the non-political St Andrew's
Day Society have been ridiculed by this pathetic performance by Labour
Party officials in Fife. Dr Markland's disparaging remark that the
matter was ''trivial'' is shameful.

<HEADLINE>Death fears as author of book on Lockerbie seeks asylum</HEADLINE>

A FORMER American secret service agent, who claims he has been hounded
by the US Government since he wrote a book questioning the Libyan
Lockerbie theory, is to seek political asylum in France.
He is being supported by Labour MP Tam Dalyell, who believes the
author's life would be in danger if he returned to the US.
Mr Lester Coleman, author of On the Trail of the Octopus, yesterday
told The Herald from Paris that his French lawyer would be ready to make
the formal application in a week.
''In terms of the Geneva Convention, the American Government is
persecuting my family and myself. We have evidence of FBI documents
which have been proven to contain fabricated statements regarding the
investigation of me in America,'' he said.
''The FBI tried to have me deported based on evidence that is a proven
fabrication. They have brought trumped-up charges of perjury against me
in America: a threat to try to stop publication of the book.
''But the book has been published by Bloomsbury and by Penguin and is
to be published in the US by Argonaut.''
Sweden has refused to grant asylum to Mr Coleman. The current move is
calculated to cause maximum embarrassment to the Americans. Mr Coleman
is hopeful the French will view his application seriously, particularly
in light of recent American-French diplomatic difficulties over alleged
spying.
Only a week ago, he says, the Americans granted asylum to Frenchman
Ali Bourequat, who allegedly faced persecution in France over claims
that French police had acted in partnership with drug dealers.
The central thrust of his book is that, in the late '80s, the United
States Drugs Enforcement Agency had in its employ in Lebanon more than
30 informants over whom it had no direct control because it could not go
directly to Lebanon.
They were running controlled deliveries of heroin from Beirut through
Frankfurt to London and thence to New York and eventually Detroit, a
classic DEA ''sting'' operation aimed at entrapping American drugs
importers.
However, security was so lax that knowledge of the sting route was
leaked and the Syrians, paid $10m dollars by the Iranians, smuggled a
bomb on board PanAm Flight 103, carried aboard unwittingly at Frankfurt
by the passenger Khalid Jafar. He died when the flight came down over
Lockerbie in December 1988, killing 270.
The theory is in direct conflict with the line being pursued by both
US and British governments, that Libya alone was behind the bombing and
that the bomb was loaded at Frankfurt from a Malta feeder flight. The
extradition of two Libyan agents is being sought for trial either here
or in the US.
Mr Dalyell, MP for Linlithgow, said yesterday: ''Although he was not
at a very high level, he was in a position to know what he wrote about.
The book was co-authored by a man called Dan Goddard, who is a very
serious man, for 10 years an assistant editor of the New York Times.
''In what Coleman has said to me there is much which I could not prove
was false and much that was accurate to my knowledge. He seems to have
the weight of the US on his back and has been much attacked by them
because he is a potential threat to certain people. I think he has to be
taken extremely seriously.''
Mr Dalyell said he believed the Americans had put pressure on the
Swedes. ''I have no doubt that if Coleman went back to the United States
he would end up under a train. France has a distinguished record in the
matter of political asylum. I think this is a genuine application in
that his life is undoubtedly at stake if he goes back to the US.''
In another twist to the Lockerbie saga, it emerged yesterday that the
controversial documentary, The Maltese Double Cross, is to be screened
on national television in Germany and Australia. The film, made by Allan
Francovich, challenges the British and American view that the bombing
was solely the work of two Libyan agents.
It has already been screened in the House of Commons and at Glasgow
Film Theatre but was withdrawn from the schedules by Channel 4.
Francovich's principal researcher, Mr John Ashton, said it was important
that the film be shown as widely as possible.

A LIST of common trees and plants which can trigger hay fever was
unveiled yesterday: hay was not included.
To mark yesterday's Hay Fever Prevention Day, backed by the British
Allergy Foundation, Edinburgh-based Scottish Centre for Pollen Studies
issued a list of ''rogue'' greenery which can cause symptoms.
It also scotched the belief that hay fever strikes only in the height
of the summer. Sufferers can be affected in February until September by
everything from trees to nettles.
As sunshine engulfed most of Scotland, centre director Eric Caulton
also said the condition had been wrongly named. ''Hay fever is a
misnomer. It is not caused by hay, nor does it cause fever. The medical
name for the condition is seasonal allergic rhinitis, caused by airborne
pollens,'' he said.
The centre said the pollens of the yew, hazel, alder, willow, ash,
poplar, birch, elm, pine, and oak trees could trigger symptoms between
February and June. Pollens from grasses, dock, and sorrel leaves,
nettles and mugwort are also blamed for streaming eyes and noses between
May and September.
One in five of the UK population is thought to suffer from hay fever
at some time in their lives, Mr Caulton said.
The centre, based at Napier University's Merchiston campus, monitors
pollen levels in Edinburgh on a weekly basis between February and April
and daily between April and August. It issues daily pollen counts in the
peak June to August period.
The information can help those afflicted by warning them when to stay
indoors and to time medication doses, said the centre, which hopes its
daily records may be used by pharmaceutical companies conducting
clinical trials on allergy products.
The centre says it is possible to forecast the pollen count, despite
the difficulties posed by Scottish weather.

THE Marquis of Blandford last night began a 30-day prison sentence for
forging prescriptions, stealing drugs, and breach of probation.
The troubled aristocrat, who admitted the charges, was believed to be
in Brixton Prison, south London, after a magistrate told him: ''These
offences are so serious that only a custodial sentence can be
justified.''
The peer, said to have suffered a fractured skull when mugged in
February, and to be unwell at present, sat trembling in the dock during
his appearance at Horseferry Road, central London, and looked shocked at
the sentence.
He received consecutive 15-day terms on two charges of forging
prescriptions, 15 days concurrent for stealing drugs, and a #100 fine or
one day for breach of probation.
Mr Nazir Afzal, prosecuting, said Blandford went into a pharmacist's
in King's Road, south-west London, on March 27 and presented two
prescriptions, purporting to be in the name of his doctor.
The pharmacist told him all the drugs were available except one. They
were prepared and he offered an American Express card but when it was
swiped through a machine it was refused. He said he would return to his
car and get cash and grabbed the drugs as he did so.
They were all class C drugs, all misused by addicts, Mr Afzal said.
Blandford, 39, of Lawrence Street, Chelsea, admitted the forgery when
interviewed by police. He had photocopied previous prescriptions,
placing paper over them to leave a blank space, then writing in the
drugs.
He was remanded on conditional bail last week into the care of the
private Charter Nightingale Hospital, Chelsea.
Miss Belinda Pearce, defending, said his drug habit seemed to be
tailing off from the use of higher class drugs to prescribed drugs.
''He hopes to be getting off everything and that's the purpose of
these prescribed drugs.''
His doctor, Brenda Davies, had gone on holiday, leaving him at the
clinic where he was receiving treatment.
''Unfortunately, whether it's an oversight on her behalf or not, he
was not given his prescribed medication in her absence.''
Magistrate Ros Keating told Blandford: ''It's a tragedy to see
somebody like you before the court.''
However, she added: ''These offences are so serious that only a
custodial sentence can be justified, particularly because of their
nature and gravity.''
A further charge of making off without payment of a taxi fare in west
London on March 28 was withdrawn.
* Blandford does not plan to appeal, said Mr Ernie Cohen of Davis
Hanson, solicitors, the company which has been representing him.

THE suicide orders of a Scottish soldier who fought in a different war
were selected yesterday to launch the official Government programme to
mark the 50th anniversary of the end of the Second World War.
There are forewords from the Queen and Prime Minister John Major in
the booklet, which will go on sale in shops throughout the country.
However, Colonel Michael Dewar, war historian and editor of the
official programme, at the media launch yesterday chose to go back to
the First World War to epitomise what VE-Day was all about.
Following the nationwide reaction over the fiasco of the spam-fritter
cooking competition in a Scottish castle -- one of the initial
suggestions to mark D-Day last year -- the Government was at pains to
rescue the situation by spending vast sums this year on celebrating
VE-Day.
Millions of pounds are being spent to make this a nationwide party and
Mr Major is at the forefront to ensure we all enjoy ourselves on May 8.
However, in launching the official programme for VE-Day, Colonel Dewar
referred to the First World War and a pillbox in Paschendale in 1917,
when a Corporal Campbell issued orders to the seven men under his
command.
1 This position will be held and the section remain here until
relieved.
2 The enemy cannot be allowed to interfere.
3 If this section cannot remain here alive, it will remain here dead
but, in any case, it will remain here.
4 Should any man through shell shock or such cause attempt to
surrender, he will stay here dead.
Thereafter, Corporal Campbell continued his orders. Not one man in his
section survived, Colonel Dewar said.
At yesterday's launch of the official VE-Day programme were old
soldiers, including at least one field marshal, who nodded heads in
approval as the corporal's orders were read out.

End of the Second World War is published by Whitehall Publications &amp;

THERE is a thoughtful, rather sad quality to a house that has been
empty, unheated, and alone for some months. When you wrench the door
open and stop inside, the air is chill and still. If you had left the
house suddenly, as I had, there is a Marie Celeste atmosphere; a cup and
saucer on the table, a book still open at a chapter, letters that had
just come when you left, still in torn envelopes. And then there are the
surviving elements of your personality: photographs still neatly
hanging, a packet of cigarettes on the mantlepiece. A scrawled note by
the phone ''Doc Boyd. Tue 3''.
I have been away from Harris for months, and back for a few stressed
and difficult days to order my affairs. I meant to stay in the house,
but when I went down on Friday to switch on the heating, and tried to
restore water from the stopcock, not a drop emerged. The plumber,
summond from Leverburgh, came on Saturday, and rapidly diagnosed a
block. ''They'll have been scouring the mains,'' he said, ''and the muck
has settled at your end, seeing as your place is the lowest.''
The plumber, Donnie MacRae, had driven all the way from Leverburgh, a
return trip of at least an hour -- but it should be put on record that,
within 20 minutes, he had unblocked the mains, restored my water,
cleaned flues, and lit the Rayburn, renewed to steady beat the pulsing
heart of the house, and awoken a happy chorus of gurgles from the
radiators, and for all this demanded but the risible fee of #25. I was
so ashamed I gave him #28.
But it was too late. The house, bedding, and so on could not be
prepared for habitation that night. I could not move in on the Sabbath.
And I was leaving on Tuesday anyway.
I sat for a couple of hours on Saturday afternoon, at the desk of my
study in the little house. It was over. I would not, I knew, be sleeping
in it again. I had only come to sort out various matters and then, all
arranged, put the little place on the market. It would not be farewell
to Harris -- for good or ill, we are wed for life, and by summer's end I
hope to have a better house in a more central location. (Tarbert?
Leverburgh?) But it was goodbye to this wee place and to the tiny,
ageing township.
As I said, I left suddenly last autumn. The reasons for this were both
urgent and complex, and do not merit repetition. One was a family
obligation, in Edinburgh, arising from recent horrendous events in our
church: if you are Free Church, you will know what I mean, and if you
are not the knowledge will do you no good. There were various pressing
matters of work, demanding ready access to high sources and large
libraries. And there had been an appalling local problem, something that
had defied rational solution, acutely traumatic.
I cannot write about the Free Church problem because, if I tried, my
hands would begin uncontrollably to tremble; and I cannot go into the
other trouble because, whenever I think of it, tears well into my eyes.
Well: the General Assembly, in its wisdom, will resolve the first one
way or the other; and exile, followed by relocation should end the
second.
THE weekend has assumed the air of the last act of an opera with the
scenery falling down. Most of the folk I had hoped to see are away, or
were out whenever I rang; in South Harris, my friends were occupied in
the local round of Communion services. On Friday I went to visit my
grandmother, and found her frail and, somehow, now incredibly old; she
did not recognise me, did not seem to know who I was. On Saturday I was
supposed to meet an advisor in town, but his phone rang and rang without
answer (I later learned he had been out on the croft chasing sheep).
I might have gone up to Lewis for a football match in Shawbost, but by
the time I learned of it the game was played and over. Normally, on a
Saturday, I would have taken the dog for a short walk on a long beach,
but I had left Smudge in Edinburgh.
I dashed about in the car, trying to feel busy. At length I returned
to the house, sat by the desk, made yet more futile calls. I spent an
hour searching, with final success, for a crucial press cutting. I put
the central heating off, but left the stove on. I locked up. Before I
left the village, I stood for a few minutes on the walltop of the black
house I built last year. Not a stone was out of place; the thatch, now
snugly bedded, had survived the gales of winter.
Construction of this took up most of my spare time in 1994; it looked,
now, old and permanent. It had, indeed, been a great success. But I
found myself now staring at it with no emotion whatsoever.
So I left.
In the evening I walked about Tarbert, and ''met the boat'' at the
pier, as she berthed and disgorged a mass of vehicles and people. Some
of the young people were about -- Euan MacDougall, Scott McNally, the
like -- and hailed me with big smiles. It was a mild night. I was
surprised -- oddly pleased -- to feel the bite of an early midge.
Sabbath I spent in Leverburgh at the Free Presbyterian communion.
It was a most happy day, believe it or not, length of service
notwithstanding. (In the morning we were kept in for the magnificent
total of three hours and 35 minutes.) But the preaching was good and the
singing hearty and the Gospel near and meaningful.
I had my lunch and my supper; in happy gatherings of young believers,
and the conversation was of the best sort, because we talked largely of
spiritual and eternal things, and did not dwell in the arid wastes of
church politics.
Life in Harris has succeeded in principle but failed on certain points
of detail. It was a good house to buy, the little cottage, because it
was sound and modern and free of the structural problems attending most
older buildings in the Western Isles. But it has proved rather too
small; I have thousands of books, for example, and the library is
essential to my work -- but only a tenth of them could be fitted into my
lair. The village itself was too small and remote.
My new Harris base will be somewhere larger, with shops and abundant
social life within walking distance. It was foolish, in hindsight, to go
to a wholly Church of Scotland community; they are good and gracious
people, but my tradition is quite different, and there were too many
seeds for potential conflict.
They showed me much kindness in this township, and I will miss them. I
hope, in days to come, they will remember me for my brave efforts to
adapt, and for such good as I strove to do, and not for my follies of
youth and inexperience.
I hope, whoever buys the place, that they will look after the black
house. But even if, after I am gone, the roof at length rots and
collapses, and the walls fall, the stones will remain. They will lie
there where they drop, those mighty lumps of gneiss. Someone, some day,
could lift those stones anew. Someone could build again.

PETER Broughan's film Rob Roy seems to be going down well in the
States, we are pleased to report, with several glowing testimonials
offered for the scenery, and quite a bit of praise for the actors, too.
The Associated Press, for example, is moved to swooning lyricism by
the picture's opening scenes: ''A ghostly fog cloaks the emerald green
of the Scottish Highlands, and from its wispy tendrils a clan of
determined men storms through. They are after a grungy horde of cattle
rustlers.''
Proceeding in this poetic vein, AP says nice things about Liam Neeson,
Jessica Lange, John Hurt, Tim Roth, and Brian ''a great smarmy
Killearn'' Cox. Only one caveat is entered: ''The Scottish accents can
become a bit trying at times, however, and you might wish for subtitles
to get you through.''
Yes, you very well might, given that Neeson is Irish, Lange American,
Hurt and Roth English, and Cox the only Scot among them. You'll have
had, as AP's masters of English might put it, your wispy tendrils, then?
Cardinal sin
IN the search for the authentic Scot, look no further than Robert
Carlyle who has, for our money, been making a pretty good fist of the
Plockton plod Hamish Macbeth on Sunday nights. Good as he is, comedy is
far from all this talented actor does however, as anyone who has seen
the movie Priest, in which Carlyle plays Linus Roache's gay lover, will
testify.
The feature was a big hit at the last Toronto Film festival, but it's
arrival in the US hasn't been quite such a happy experience. Of the five
priests depicted, one is gay, one actively heterosexual, and the others
''alcoholic, unstable, and insensitive''. Some suggest this is
unrealistic.
On cue, 20 Christian groups have boycotted the film, thus guaranteeing
it a future at the box office. But a writer in the weekly Catholic New
York has put the tin lid on the matter, stating: ''No doubt whatsoever,
the movie Priest has to be as viciously anti-Catholic as anything that
has ever rotted on the silver screen.''
Tough words, but it's not every day you get reviewed by a cardinal.
Then again, it's not every reviewer who admits, as John O'Connor,
Archbishop of New York, is happy to do, that (but of course) he hasn't
actually seen the film.
The best bit is, Priest is being distributed by the Disney
Organisation. What will they say in Lochdubh?
End result
SCOTLAND on Sunday is known as a newspaper keen to provide a
comprehensive service. For that reason, perhaps, it saved fans the
bother of watching last night's final, crucial episode of Lynda La
Plante's She's Out by reviewing the show -- and giving away the ending
-- the day before transmission. Next week: those English council
election results in full.
Men's day
THOSE who missed US Women's Health Day on Saturday can make what they
will of a speech delivered by Dr Joyce Brothers, the moderately
well-known shrink.
Men, she said, are more cheerful than women and husbands are smarter
than their wives. The boys also ''focus'' on their good qualities while
women (even without the doctor's help) focus on their faults.
Brothers added: ''When a man walks in front of a mirror, he sees
Arnold Schwarzenegger.'' She then cited ''studies'' indicating that men
are likely to be more optimistic, even when resembling a
steroid-inflated Austrian with an accent that would trouble AP, than the
opposite sex. To round things off, Dr Joyce claimed that while women are
attracted to men who are intelligent, men ''favour women who aren't as
bright''.
Whether any of this made anyone feel better on Women's Health Day is a
point likely to remain thoroughly moot.
Off the wall
THE question of what can happen to old rock stars was solved last
week, to our satisfaction at least, by Bob Dylan. Other ''legends'' are
less adventurous. Rod Stewart is weening himself off the peroxide bottle
and going into retirement; David Bowie, lacking a hit lately, has found
a whole new career.
Bowie being Bowie, this does not imply that he will stray from the
creative cutting edge or cease to be chimerical, dead cool, and
unimpeachably avant garde. You guessed it: old Ziggy has designed his
own wallpaper collection.
Working with Laura Ashley, than whom there is none more hip, Bowie has
produced what is described a ''minotaur motif''. The company seems
pleased, though they did draw the line, so to speak, at his depiction of
the beast's genitalia. Hardly the thing for the front room, really.
''It's been a good working relationship,'' Bowie has said, ''apart
from the castration that is.''
Bit parts
SOME of you will be aware that the National Enquirer, publisher of
stories true in each and every circumstance, is now available in
Britain. It describes itself as having ''the biggest circulation of any
paper in America'', and the reasons aren't hard to find.
The latest issue, for example, reveals the ''top-secret plot'' of
Heather Blaze, the Duchess of York's first foray into film-making.
Apparently this involves two talking horses. Sadly, it doesn't say
which one Fergie plays.
See no evil
AFTER the Internet hype comes, inevitably, the backlash. Some people
are even saying that the biggest breakthrough in communications since
smoke signals is being put to some really silly uses.
There is the case, for example, of Tom Jennings. In the name of
greater understanding Mr Jennings has placed a digital image of his
toilet on line for all the world to see. Then there is, for those who
can stand it, the World Wide Web page that consists simply of a display
of an unblinking eye. Daft? Professor Donna Hoffman of Vanderbilt
University, who studies commercial applications of the Net, thinks not.
Or, as she wrote recently: ''The toilet or the eye aren't useless.
They're creative. It's the beginning of the innovation and we are
witnessing experimentation and play. These sorts of activities will fuel
the growth of the next stage of the medium's development where it starts
to become 'useful'.''
To test this theory, we intend to post a picture of a bearded,
grinning, shifty-looking character atop this column in the near future,
just to see how useful that is.

THE depopulation of Knoydart began with a bang -- or a broadside, to
be more precise. It came from HMS Furnace on Saturday, May 10, 1746, and
was directed at Inverie House to punish its owner, Coll MacDonell of
Barrisdale, for the part he played in the '45 Jacobite Rebellion. The
destruction of the house (since restored) presaged the Highland
Clearances of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.
The peninsula passed out of Scottish hands when the sixteenth laird of
Knoydart, Aeneas MacDonell, died and his widow decided to sell the
estate. To make it more marketable she converted it to sheep-farming,
and in the summer of 1853 the crofters were driven from their homes and
herded on to a ship bound for Canada. Their houses were burned or
demolished, and the estate was sold to an English coal merchant.
Its principal use in the twentieth century has been as a sporting
estate, traded with varying degrees of profit among the British
aristocracy. Prominent among the absentee owners was Lord Brocket, an
Old Etonian who had inherited a brewing business. Lord Brocket liked
Nazis -- he was a guest of Hitler shortly before the Second World War --
but he did not like local children, whom he banned from walking in front
of Inverie House because they spoiled the view. He allowed sheep-farming
to decline, dismissing those inhabitants he found surplus to his
requirements. The Seven Men of Knoydart were among them.
The next laird was Oliver Eyre Crossthwaite-Eyre, a wealthy
Conservative MP who is chiefly remembered for having caused the exodus
in the 1960s of the remaining Highlanders working as shepherds on the
estate. His successor, Lord Hesketh, a Conservative minister in the
House of Lords, bought Knoydart in 1972 for #250,000 and sold it five
months later for #1.25m.
Major Nigel Chamberlayne-Macdonald, a member of the Queen's Household,
then made a valiant attempt to restore the estate's fortunes by building
a fish farm and a venison-processing plant, but after a decade of
unrelenting losses he put it up for sale and more people drifted away.
The break-up of the 55,000-acres estate was effected by Philip Rhodes,
a Surrey property developer, who bought it from Major
Chamberlayne-Macdonald in 1984 for #1.08m and promptly set about selling
large chunks of it at a substantial profit. The 16,500-acres portion
including the village of Inverie was acquired by Titaghur in 1993 for
#1.7m.

A BAR manageress claims she was forced to quit her job at Glasgow's
Polish Club because of harassment over alleged stock shortages.
British-born Mrs Jenny Barkowska, claimed the cause of her problems
was that she was Jewish.
She told a Glasgow industrial tribunal yesterday: ''I am not a Pole. I
am a Jewess and a Jewess cannot be in charge of the Polish Club.''
She alleged she was constantly harassed and intimidated over alleged
stock discrepancies by Mr Alex Alfer, chairman of the Polish Club at
Park Grove Terrace, Glasgow, until she was forced to quit her job. She
claims constructive and unfair dismissal.
Mrs Barkowska, 54, who lives in a flat above the club, told the
tribunal the harassment continued after she left, when her rent was
increased by #5 a week.
She said her husband, who is a Pole, moved a motion of no confidence
in the chairman at last year's AGM on her behalf as meetings were held
in Polish. It received no support.
Several weeks later, she handed in her notice when she was asked to
pay the club #390 for an alleged stock shortage. ''I said there was a
mistake. That was the straw that broke the camel's back. I was fed up
with the constant mistakes, harassment over money, accusations, and
snide remarks.''
She said she was once asked for #690 to make up a stock shortage but
it was a clerical error.
She alleged her problems started after Mr Alfer became chairman. ''He
made it plain to me I was a woman and it was a man's job. He wanted rid
of me. He made it quite clear.''
The Polish Club denies that Mrs Barkowska was dismissed unfairly,
claiming she was fairly treated.
Mr Alfer claimed there had been a monthly surplus since a new bar
manager had taken over.
He agreed that Mrs Barkowska's rent had gone up. ''When she was
manageress, we decided to overlook the fact it was a couple living
there. As she is no longer manageress, we decided to put the rent up.''
He admitted a job advert was placed after she said the job was too
much for her.
He told the tribunal: ''I am surprised at all these accusations
against me. I have never done anything for Jenny to be abusive towards
me.''
The hearing was adjourned until June 14.

Strathclyde University taps into a very real need among people in the
construction industry to sharpen their legal skills
A PIONEERING part-time Construction Law course at Strathclyde
University has proved to be an unqualified success.
The pilot course, which is run by Strathclyde University Law School,
has exceeded its expected student roll-call by more than 33%.
According to the administrators the course, specially designed for
people already working in the legal profession or construction industry,
required a minimum of 15 students.
But a total of 60 inquiries were received -- including a number only
hours before it was due to start.
Twenty-one students -- including two women -- who all have daytime
jobs, have now been accepted on the course.
Professor Robert Burgess, course director, said: ''We have obviously
tapped into a very real need within the construction industry.
''Although the course was designed for members of both the legal
profession and the construction industry, the largest proportion of
inquiries -- 95% -- came from the construction side.''
From the construction side the range of professionals on the course
spans from architects to quantity surveyors to consulting engineers.
William Alexander, a consulting engineer of 20 years' standing, said:
''During the course of my career I have witnessed a steady increase in
disputes requiring arbitration and it has become patently obvious that
people in the industry need to sharpen their legal skills.
''Through taking this course I hope to be able to offer customers a
breadth of expertise through a greater understanding of the arbitration
process and how to avoid legal difficulties arising in the first
place.''
Another student, Janey Milligan, a chartered quantity surveyor who is
currently working as a lecturer at Caledonian University, said: ''For
me, taking the course is very much about adding another string to my
bow.
''The traditional role of quantity surveying is changing and it has
become very important to have a greater understanding of the diverse
aspects associated with the profession.''
Developed by the law school through its Centre for Professional Legal
Studies in consultation with the university's Civil Engineering
Department, the modular format course requires the part-time students to
attend one evening/late afternoon class a week and includes a weekend of
seminars and workshops in each semester.
Students with law degrees are required to attend an introductory
module on Building and the Construction Process, while students without
a law degree are obliged first to take Legal Process and Law of
Contracts module.
Other subjects on the course include: the Law of the Construction
Industry; Law and Practice of Construction Management; Dispute
Resolution; Law and Finance; and Land Law.

AS one of the few last male bastions with its foundations still
intact, albeit under siege, the construction industry doesn't so much
present women with a ''glass ceiling'' as a brick one.
Women who want to scale the heights in the professions connected to
the building trade know there is an upper level but they don't get so
much as a peek at it, never mind directions to the escalator.
Janey Milligan is a chartered surveyor who has opted to build if not
her own escalator at least her own stairway by broadening her
professional horizons.
Having been in the construction industry for 15 years as a quantity
surveyor, she took a sidestep in 1993 to become a lecturer in her field
at Glasgow Caledonian University.
Now she has taken the education process further by signing up for the
part-time Construction Law course at Strathclyde University Law School.
A mother of two young children, Janey said: ''The construction
industry is still very male-dominated and it can be difficult for women
to make the right connections to get on.
''Women are getting in on the ground floor as electricians and even
brickies but it is at a professional level that real barriers are now
being put up. It may not be as privileged as the old establishment, but
the construction industry does operate its own boys' network.''
According to Janey Milligan, the part-time Construction Law course at
Strathclyde offers an alternative path to boosting her career.
She said: ''The traditional view of quantity surveying is changing and
all professionals in this field are having to look at other options.
Construction law for me represents an obvious area to develop as
arbitration and dispute management become more important to the
industry.
''Taking the course is also about adding another string to my bow and
bulking up my range of qualifications to give me -- as a professional
woman in the construction industry -- an edge and a means to help myself
up the career ladder.''

Julie Bertagna reports on a new course that helps us to identify
stress in the workplace and shows us how to tackle it
Research reveals that workaholics -- those who regularly clock up more
than 56 hours a week -- achieve significantly less than nine-to-five
sticklers
STRESS, both in and outside the workplace, is a fact of life. Commonly
perceived as a modern disease, the effects of stress can be serious:
devastating for the individuals in terms of health and personal
happiness, and a severe drain on their performance at work.
Increasingly, employers are finding it hard to ignore the effects of
stress in the workplace and many now realise that investment in stress
management pays dividends. It has become a vital area of skills training
as it has been proven to cut absenteeism and help create a happier
work-force and a more effective business.
Stress is not, of course, a modern phenomenon. Long ago, our bodies
developed a complex system of stress responses to enable us to cope with
the sudden need to escape large hungry beasts or marauding invaders --
the ''fight or flight'' response.
These days, when stress is typically caused by the combined pressure
of work and life events, our bodies remain in a time warp, and get set
for that sprint out of the path of danger. Yet the stress responses that
once saved our lives have, in our sedentary home and business culture,
become a serious health hazard.
The short-term physical effects of stress can be easy to ignore:
palpitations, a dry mouth and muscle tension as a deadline or deal
approaches; there is also a sudden increase in body cholesterol and
blood clotting alongside other dramatic changes in the central nervous
system. Unchecked, long-term stress can cause mild warning symptoms to
develop into heart disease, high blood pressure, ulcers, or strokes.
Likewise, habitual anxiety can cause a variety of psychological
problems.
Recent research shows that it's often those you would least expect who
fall foul of stress -- not the whinger or the incompetent but the driven
high flier who seemed to have it all under control. It also reveals that
workaholics -- those who regularly clock up more than 56 hours a week --
achieve significantly less than nine-to-five sticklers.
A good stress management course will teach techniques and new ways of
thinking that help minimise stressful reactions. Working Under Pressure
is one such course, devised by the Glasgow-based Taylor Clarke
Partnership.
The largest human resources consultancy in Scotland, Taylor Clarke has
recently expanded its services into London. Ros Taylor, the psychologist
and broadcaster (her social science programme, Between Ourselves, is
currently on Radio Scotland) heads a UK network of some 60 associate
consultants, plus the core team in Glasgow.
Using the latest research into stress, the Working Under Pressure
course aims to enable people to identify stress in their workplace and
teaches ways of tackling it. ''Taster'' mornings are available for
organisations to meet to discuss how Working Under Pressure can be
tailored to suit their particular needs.
Course leader Alex Barr derived many of the stress management
techniques during 16 years running her own companies. In the past year
she has delivered the Working Under Pressure course to more than 1000
people.
''You can give people endless coping strategies but whether they do it
or not is up to them,'' Alex Barr admits. ''But 80% of the battle is
awareness. Awareness means the choice over whether or not to do
something about stress.''
Recent research by Nottingham University concluded that the major
source of workplace stress is when people feel they're not in control.
''That's when the victim mentality sets in and stress-related illness
can start,'' says Alex Barr.
Shop-floor workers, trapped in repetitive jobs, suffer far more than
the apparently stressed-out executives who are much more in control of
their situation, according to the research, especially when a company or
organisation undergoes some form of change.
''At the moment I'm seeing quite a lot of stressed-out individuals,''
says Yvonne Cuthbertson, training and development manager for Post
Office Counters Ltd. Yvonne has come along to a WUP taster morning to
''dip a toe in the water and find out about new strategies that will
support staff to cope better with changes in work roles. There is a
feeling at the moment of 'Well, we're here, but we aren't quite prepared
for what we're meant to do in our new roles'.''
''The point where a pressure build-up becomes stress usually takes you
by surprise. When companies go through change, for whatever reason,
there is the danger that they will ignore the added-on effect of normal
life stresses in their work-force,'' says Alex Barr, who believes these
outside pressures are often the reason why one person will react much
worse to stress at work than a colleague at the next desk.
While businesses cannot be expected to deal with the ups and downs of
their employees' private lives, Alex believes that it is worth taking
into account the varying life stresses that commonly affect individuals.
This is where the use of specially designed stress audits and surveys
can be of benefit to an organisation; these are a simple and accurate
means of assessing where a work-force is on the stress scale. And as
life stresses affect everyone to some degree, stress management training
can help to get the best out of every work-force.
Take the case of an entire sales team heading for burnout. The
introduction of new technology, a new product, or a new team leader that
doesn't gel might be the last straw -- the consequences can be a surge
in stress-related illness, and a demoralised team, working well below
par.
A Working Under Pressure course can be tailored to suit the needs of
an individual company so that major areas of pressure affecting a
particular work-force can be identified and strategies formed which will
reduce it.
Common stressors, gleaned from recent research into the subject and
from surveys of the wide range of clients who attended WUP courses over
the past year, range from external factors such as workplace noise,
lighting, and temperature to organisational problems such as lack of
training, bad communication, unclear work tasks, boreout and burnout
(work underload or overload). A combination of more than a few of the
above is likely to result in mass depression and a seriously
stressed-out work-force.
More complex stressors are unproductive team mixes and the negative
effects of the workplace stress carrier (the Panic Merchant, the
Cop-outer, the Black Cloud, and the Stressless Wonder are but a few).
Working Under Pressure courses aim to teach clients a variety of
stress-beating strategies. Personal stress audits and surveys raise
awareness of the problem while positive thinking and creative
problem-solving techniques are used to empower individuals to tackle the
issues. The importance of relaxation, diet, and exercise are emphasised
too.
And Alex Barr has some essential de-stressing skills to impart to help
calm the blood during those tricky work situations -- dealing with the
colleague or boss from hell -- that everyone comes up against at least
once in a while.

HERR Marlin Eckhard Maruma, professor of architecture and art and now
laird of the Hebridean island of Eigg, faces an uphill task -- the
struggle to put his will on a canvas broader than any he has tackled
before. Herr Maruma, a German, has paid #1.5m for what could be paradise
-- or an albatross that will make him rue the day. He will want to win
hearts and minds throughout the island population of 80 . . . most of
whom are cautiously willing to be wooed and won. But there are
questions, doubts, and suspicion.
During the past three decades Eigg has suffered a roller-coaster of
lairds who bought their island plaything on whim or fancy and sold again
when boredom or stretched finances ended the island idyll. Some were
weavers of dreams, other spinners of tales. Money was exchanged for
title deeds, a bolt hole and the conceit of lairdship, but always it was
the islanders who paid the price.
Eigg is an island like few on Scotland's west coast. Lush and green,
wooded and fertile, it is dominated by the volcanic plug of An Sgurr . .
. a battery of stone organ pipes forced from the core of the earth to
melt and weld together in a towering landmark that can be seen
throughout the Parish of the Small Isles.
For years, right into the mid-sixties, Eigg slept largely undisturbed
under the patronage of Viscount Runciman, shipping millions and an
old-style approach . . . the island part of the twentieth century but
scarce changed in pace from the days when almost 200 of the Macdonald
inhabitants were slaughtered by Macleods of Skye, smothered by wood
smoke in what is still known as Massacre Cave.
Then, in the summer of 1966, Eigg went on the market -- the entire
island, two churches, 18 crofts, two farms, the 10-bedroom Galmisdale
Lodge, built in 1926, and a pier bought by Shropshire landowner Robert
Evans for a mere #45,000. Viscount Runciman had hoped to do rather
better. So too had the good folk of Eigg.
Professional land management, Shropshire style, seemed imminent but
Robert Evans lasted only five years and few are the islanders who can
recall meeting him around their crofts or in the shadow of the Big
House. His popularity on Eigg did not wither, for it had never bloomed.
Shropshire held Robert Evans's heart and on Janury 6, 1972, #89,000 was
added to his pocket -- out there by the Anglyn Trust which bought Eigg
''as a non profit-making Christian charity formed to educate handicapped
children regardless of colour, class or creed''.
Heading the trust was Bernard Farnham-Smith, a plain mister who liked
to be called commander, self-declared bearer of gifts. Great things were
promised for the future of Eigg. A former fireman who suffered
difficulties with his brigade over the possession and use of various
items of equipment Farnham-Smith had, for a period before coming to
Eigg, operated a school at Nuthurst in Surrey where the boys paraded in
mock naval uniform.
Unlike Viscount Runciman and Robert Evans the bearded, rotund
''Commander'' was omni-present . . . but for only half the time of his
immediate predecessor. A parade of boys in bell-bottom trousers and
sailors' caps would, undoubtedly, have created something of a stir on
Eigg where the drama of the day seldom exceeds the movement of the
tides. But chance would have been a fine thing for no more than three
pupils were ever seen about the island . . . calling at the doors of
croft houses, it was reported, in the hope of a bowl of porridge or
second-day broth.
The islanders were not amused. Farnham-Smith claimed a population
increase from 50 to 80 during his stewardship but, when trustees and
families totalling nine were removed from the roll, it was found that
the population had, in fact, dropped to 41. In the summer of 1974
Farnham-Smith and the Albyn Trust packed their sailor suits and faded
away to the mainland. Eigg, once more, went on the market.
Two years later Keith Schellenberg -- family money from ship-chandling
on the Tyne and personal predelictions of a sporting playboy -- paid
#270,000 for the palm-fringed Gulf Stream paradise where, for almost the
past two decades, his writ has uneasily run. Keith Schellenberg, hot-air
balloonist, Cresta Run aficionado, regards himself as a man
misunderstood, unhappily born out of his time.
Eigg's now 80-strong community is by and large unanimous in believing
they understand him only too well and make it plain that whatever time
he believes he should have been born in they would rather it had not
been theirs. Keith Schellenberg developed during his ownership of Eigg
the very clear impression that he, man of action, vision, and
generosity, was being put upon by a slothful island population
interested less in give than in take.
Not long ago, in the dining-room of Galmisdale House, the lachrymose
laird assured me he was possessed by an ungrateful and avaricious
peasantry. The colour of his vituperation was eclipsed only by the
brilliant hues of the fungi consuming the ceiling. Island estates and
the ravages of the West Highland climate, explained Schellenberg, simply
soaked up cash. Outside Galmisdale House the estate's death-trap Land
Rover bore lop-sided testimony to the same claim.
The Schellenberg years on Eigg passed unhappily with rows over leases
and security of tenure: claim, counter claim, accusation, and rebuttal.
Schellenberg organised the annual Eigg Games, initiated an air service,
and saw the maiden flight plough into a wire fence. He capered on the
Orient Express and rode a large rigid inflatable from the island to
Arisaig, for all the world like a cowboy riding into town for a wild
night away from the ranch.
Matrimonial disputes held the headlines, ending in divorce three years
ago, at which point Schellenberg, who had bought the island jointly with
his then second wife, Margaret, purchased Eigg in his own right. The
joys of the sole proprietor were short-lived -- his vintage Rolls-Royce
and ancient fire engine went up in flames and mutterings against his
rule became vociferous. Arson and conspiracy, he said. The island's mood
grew increasingly bitter.
In the closing years of his possession Schellenberg spent moody hours
in a beach-side hut stuffed with the superannuated tools of gladiatorial
combat on the sporting field. Ironic that for one who played so hard to
win he should have been seduced and defeated by such a fair opponent as
Eigg.
Now, for #1.5m, Eigg has gone offshore. As he presses the flesh in
coming days the new owner -- already driven to a denial of mysticism and
fire-worshipping -- assures the people of Eigg that his intentions are
honourable. What the island needs, what they want, they will do together
-- people and proprietor as one. Many, as they hear that promise, will
ask themselves ''now where, and how often, have I heard that before?''

SMOKING is like adultery: if you have any honesty you will admit you
have chosen the short-term high in the face of the long-term
consequence. And inhaled.
This is no defence of smoking. There is no need for debate or
argument, the habit kills. Don't start, or stop if you can. There.
It is no longer sexy, the connection with the languorous is snipped:
smoking is not cool, that grab for the fix is the moment of existential
panic; not Noel Coward, just cowardly. Not Lily Marlene, just poor old
Fag Ash Lill. I know.
I gave up for three and a half years and tasted freedom. No more
pathetic shleps to late-opening garages in the rain at two in the
morning. (I once hailed a taxi outside my front door in the small hours
to beg, willing to pay, for a drag.) The breakthrough was being able to
write a play without the corny accoutrements of caffeine and nicotine
and that strict lateness when there is nobody you can excusably phone. I
wrote during the day, like a grown-up. Camomile tea and mineral water:
this unfamiliar me, monitoring my anxious moments with calm. The play
was OK, the apartment no longer smelt stale: I even felt guilty when I
was congratulated on my abstinence, for I no longer craved.
But I'm back to craving. I'm deep kissing the existential moment; I
lust after cartons of them beside the keyboard, as if they were duty
frees and I'd just been somewhere other than the Co-Op on Great Western
Road. My pretend Manhattan, my delusory bogus sophistication. You don't
get to be Lillian Helmann, you get to be terminal, cretina, I say to
myself, lighting up.
Then I blame Italy. (If you're going to be illogical, blame the
beautiful.) That was where I began. I still cannot pronounce Marlboro
properly, but put the stress on the first ''o''. A catch at the throat
and I'm on that beach again, I'm 17, reading De Beauvoir, and
negotiating my evening-out allowance with my padre. Ah, smoking: the
rebellion you don't need a partner for. And up there in the blue sky
above me, a tiny aeroplane with a streamer of lying advertising words,
flickering like tail on a kite: ''Marlboro: La Cigaretta Pui
Cigaretta''. How nonsense-memory doth make fools of us all.
And however foolish the addiction, the self-righteous puritanism of
the anti-s, militates my spurious-decadent heart against (like St
Augustine) giving up yet. Lord, how I loathe them. To my credit when I
was not a smoker, I never did that opening of the windows, can you do it
in the garden?, crap.
I have a vehemently anti-smoking ex-inlaw who handed me an ashtray,
after two un-nicotined hours of party boredom, shaped like a coffin with
a dinky little skull at the end, and I chain-smoked for the rest of the
evening. But then she was a born-again Christian, with a deep-seated
distrust of Italian atheist papes. (I just lit up there, thinking about
it. And I'm no longer even maritally related. Bliss, short term I know,
but bliss.)
Here's a list of quotes which lighter-fuel our inexcusable addiction:
''No thanks, in love with living.''
(American accent) ''Thank you, no, I've transcended my masochist
phase.''
''No, sorry, I don't -- Sweetheart, could you get that ashtray we used
to have? Attic maybe? You were saying . . ?''
''It was yoga that helped me stop.''
''Didn't you stop for three and a half years? Was it the divorce,
dear, that relapsed you?''
''How can your lungs embrace the countryside?''
''You stopped once, I'm sure you can do it again. Once you're solvent
and everything.''
''Good God no.''
Well there it is. Good God no. My school motto was ''The Good God he
is so Good''. Tautology, smallogy, what does it matter as long as you
are going to heaven? Heaven: where the unbridled is not sinful, where
the oxygen necks with the Sobranie, and all the ecstatic atheists shout,
''Keys. We were wrong.''
All this simply means you should not but you probably will. My
daughter conflates the words ''probably'' and ''properly'' into
''properbubly'': it's a great word, moralism and kicks in the same
hedonistic admonishment. I pray to no God that she never smokes, that
her Mamma will stop again, and in the meantime her only passivity will
be my smoking. (In the garden.)

HEALTH experts say that religious rules on diet usually have a sound
medical basis. In the Middle East, for instance, under-cooked pork still
carries the risk of a horrible death from trichinosis, and there are a
host of flukes, tapeworms, and other parasites waiting to continue their
life cycle. In colder climates we know pigs as intelligent, sensitive,
and -- given the opportunity -- hygienic creatures. For nomadic tribes
ever short of fuel, however, it was far more practical to declare them
unclean, along with hares, camels, shellfish, etc, which doubtless have
their own problems. Thus it has come about that while Charles Lamb's
eulogy on roast pork has become one of the most famous of English
essays, in other cultures even the mention of a bacon butty would cause
disgust.
The sensitivity of Muslims on the subject is being recognised by a
Cleethorpes pop group called The Piggies, which on receiving an
invitation from the United Arab Emirates, to perform at a private
concert in Dubai, has decided to change its name. Liberal Jews in
America are said to be slowly softening their attitude on food rules,
but ''kosher'' is such a familiar term that it is even used in the
Pentagon to describe those who have been security-checked. The rules of
Leviticus have certainly inspired many Jewish food alternatives. Instead
of a ham sandwich, the New Yorker eats pastrami and rye, and even that
ultimate US import from Germany, the frankfurter, is now challenged by a
Jewish hot-dog made from beef. It has become so popular that when
supplies of the Hebrew National brand ran out last week, a New York
handcart closed for five days rather than offer a lesser product.
With time, and modern hygiene, it is possible that religious food
rules will ultimately be relaxed. As many Jewish writers have recorded,
the desire to taste forbidden food can be very strong. The story is told
of Ari Frosch, on a visit to a delicatessen, buying canned peaches,
bananas, and an orange. ''Um . . . how much . . . is a quarter of
bacon?'', he asked, at which there was a flash of lightning and a loud
clap of thunder. He glared at the ceiling and cried: ''I was only asking
!''

IT was hugely encouraging to read Glasgow City Council's North Bank
Project proposals envisaging regeneration of the historic Trongate area
(March 29).
We believe the creation of a Glasgow Cross Interchange station, giving
direct/same building linkage between the planned Crossrail line and
existing Argyle line, would form a key ingredient to the long-overdue
upgrading of this neglected inner-city area of Glasgow.
The interconnection opportunities between the majority of
Strathclyde's suburban lines and the Intercity status of a Glasgow
Crossrail station (on the new
Edinburgh/Stirling-Falkirk-Paisley-Glasgow-Airport-Ayrshire/Clyde
Estuary axis) would greatly improve social mobility, employment
opportunity, and offer a wide range of community benefits desperately
needed.
We are supported by growing planning and development interest for this
Glasgow Cross rail interchange, of which the jewel in the crown would be
the creation of a flagship shopping, craft workshop, leisure,
restaurant/cafe complex within the Mercat Cross building, a truly
stunning example of urban architecture. Enchancement of this splendid
property would, we have been advised, have a major multiplier effect in
the Trongate, Gallowgate, Barrowland, and London Road areas, helping to
fill long-term gap sites and improve adjoining property values.
It is sad that the present Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive's
Crossrail plans, now deposited with Parliament, would effectively deny
future generations such benefits, with their short-sighted proposals for
an unattractive, off-centre, back-of-the-Saltmarket Station, wretchedly
hemmed-in and frustrating logical interchange opportunities.
We hope that, during the forthcoming period for comments and
objections to Parliament the vision and leadership shown by Pat Lally's
colleagues on Glasgow City Council will prevail at Glasgow Cross, giving
us a transport asset and civic environment we could be proud of.

Glasgow Cross Rail Action Group,

''WE may succeed, or we may fail'' sounds either banal or the stuff of
a risky wartime enterprise. In fact it was part of the statement
yesterday from Eurotunnel's chairman about the fortunes of the company
which commissioned the Channel Tunnel and has now begun to operate it.
The company has been dogged by financial ill-luck and poor planning. Its
advisers seriously underestimated the cost of the ''chunnel's''
construction several times, and have weighted its balance sheet far too
much in the direction of debt. If it survives, the shareholders will do
well at some point in the future when the cash flow outpaces the
interest payments. But at present it is burdened by heavy debt whose
interest payments threaten to submerge the business. If it can run fast
enough to be seen to be successful, new money will be easily available;
but it is picking up speed very slowly so far.
There is little doubt that it can attract traffic, and in enormous
volume, from a demand which is growing by leaps and bounds so that the
ferry companies are still continuing to prosper, and carry even more
customers, in face of the tunnel's early challenge. That challenge is
bound to grow for the tunnel's final capacity is several times that
which has already been achieved. The questions remain: will its revenues
arrive in time to stave off bankruptcy, or will something akin to the
Seventh Cavalry, in the shape of substantial injections of new capital,
arrive in the nick of time?
In one sense the matter is technical. The tunnel itself is now in
place and functioning well, apart from teething troubles which do not
seem to be too important. Its related services and infrastructural
provisions are not all in place, especially on the very crowded English
side where the fast railway link is still on paper only, but these can
be developed more slowly at no risk to the viability of the main
project. There is no threat to that, nor to the marketing of the
operation and the arrangements for its running.
In one sense the whole affair has been an obvious success, and, if the
actual project can hardly be called imaginative in conception, there is
no doubt that its completion was a considerable feat of engineering as
well as a good advertisement for British-French co-operation. It may
also, eventually, turn out to be an example of private enterprise
managing to finance an enormous construction project without the benefit
of public funds.
Throughout its life the company has lived dangerously, so that Sir
Alastair Morton, the chairman, has come to enjoy a reputation for
brinkmanship. Yet this is hardly of his own making -- there has never
been, for long, enough cash in hand for easy living. In retrospect, it
is clear that the equity in the capital structure should have been much
larger, and that its deferred element should not have been dependent on
a share price far higher than it was even before the latest falls.
It seems unlikely that at this point the company will collapse, though
its banks have been long-suffering to the point where their performance
contradicts utterly the common view of them, that they are too
short-term in their thinking. The banks will be reluctant to pull the
plug on Eurotunnel since that would simply crystallise losses which may
never actually materialise. It will all involve much nail-biting.
Demands may be made for public money to keep the company alive. They
might be better made first in France where the state seems accustomed to
opening the public purse for prestige projects. The British Government
might then be persuaded to follow suit: given the timing and the degree
of Eurotunnel's suffering, there might be the chance of a bargain as
well as an opportunity to show that the Government is not inhibited by
dogma over the financing of railways. Of course, there remains the
possibility that the company will be allowed to fail so that, if private
funds are seen to be have been unable to save it, the two Governments
can pick it up for a song. Even if private money does appear, it can
only be at the expense of those who bravely funded this venture in its
beginnings.

MR Foster and Sir Hector Monro write constructively about the way
forward for a Loch Lomond park authority (March 24 and April 3) but do
not dig deep enough to the root cause of the dangers ahead.
The Scottish Office's method of finding the top table bosses for the
park authority is neither local democracy nor an election for the
authority.
First comes a political election for the local authority which is won
by urban majorities choosing town councillors to tackle their urban
concerns. The polling stations of park inhabitants are joined to much
larger urban majorities and thus they are gagged.
Next the park authority is chosen from among these urban specialists
in the town halls of Stirling, Dumbarton, and (now) Lochgilphead, for
whom the park is a slither of land on the furthest edge of their main
business, and often in conflict with it. The great urban central belt
reaches to the edge of the park and then has to supply its bosses, with
no help from the inhabitants.
Mr Lang's response said that the park deserves ''an approach which can
build on existing knowledge and which derives its authority from the
people of the area''. This does neither. Let him leave the town
councillors to their elected task, and work towards true local
democratic elections for the park authority by a method ready to hand.
About 5000 voters poll within the park, all on electoral registers, a
sufficient and appropriate constituency for electing the authority. If
one adds the Trossachs, the number is much larger. The postal voting of
the Electoral Reform Society is economical and efficient. The response
would be high and non-political. No-one would have to wear two
conflicting hats.
The resultant top table could not be improved by adding any number of
votes of visitors from urban life outwith the park.
The dangers that threaten the loch stem mainly from planning
applications by commercial and visitor pressures, which need the severe
application of the Silkin test (if it does not have to be in the park,
keep it out). The magnet is scarred by the very objects it attracts,
unless guarded by a strong and wise park authority. This will come from
a constituency of the loch's age-old guardians, the park inhabitants,
but cannot come from the obscene method chosen by the Scottish Office.
The total visitor dominance now endured will urbanise much of the loch
before long, with short-term (''just this once'') decisions, to the
horror of the powerless inhabitants.
We have already seen the authority pushing for a major waterside hotel
on a greenfield site purposely visible from well up the loch, and now we
hear of two helipads to be in the park, to save well-heeled visitors a
half-hour in a limousine, while the inhabitants' homes echo to the noise
pollution of the commercial air route through the park.
The Scottish Office should provide wholly central funding (towards
which English parks inexorably move) cutting the originating umbilical
cord between the local authority and the park authority. It still
controls the purse-strings when vetting budgets. Let Scotland lead,
rather than follow England.

IS this democracy? The proposed Arran Discovery Centre on the west
coast of the island on Forestry Commission ground was dreamed up by
Argyll and Islands Enterprise and Cunninghame District Council as a
development in the best interests of tourism. The centre is to interpret
the history of Arran.
Cunninghame District Council failed to consult the local people, they
failed to advertise outline planning permission, and now have failed to
advertise detailed planning permission (closing date April 14).
They are effectively steam-rolling their plans through at a cost to
the tax-payer of #500,000 (#250,000 of which is EEC Objective 1
funding).
Islanders might prefer more funding for their existing museum and for
their proposed theatre let alone for cleaning the beaches of sewage and
upgrading our inadequate road system.
Is this a satisfactory way of spending public money?

THERE will be few tears shed over the execution of British-born
murderer Nicholas Ingram. Having been convicted by a jury of his peers
of the senseless and brutal slaying of his neighbour and the attempted
murder of his neighbour's wife, there are many who will argue that
Ingram has received just deserts.
I make no moral judgment on the right of a society to exact capital
punishment on the perpetrator of such a heinous crime, whether it be due
to the misguided assumption that it will act as a deterrent to others,
or as a result of a more pausible scenario that it is no more than an
act of retribution exacted by a society thoroughly sickened by an
ever-increasing spiral of mindless urban violence.
One cannot fail to comment, however, on the impiety of a civilised
society which allows its convicted killers to languish within the
confines of death row for a period sometimes in excess of the 12 years
in which Ingram was incarcerated subject to the uncertainty of his fate.
The inhumanity of the Government of the State of Georgia is further
compounded by the barbaric circus which surrounded his last minute stay
of execution -- a glimmer of hope only to be be expunged in the searing
embrace of the electric chair. It is the imagery of nightmares. Yet far
from being an image, it is the reality of capital punishment in Georgia
today.
Ironic, isn't it, that in the heartland of America's Bible Belt the
people of the State of Georgia should still deem it acceptable in the
closing years of the twentieth century to dispatch its miscreants to the
hereafter in such a thoroughly grotesque and profoundly unChristian
manner?

YOUR summary of the local election results throughout Scotland is a
clear indicator of an opportunity wasted and lost (April 7).
One does not need the skills or university education of the political
scientist, journalist, or party spokesperson to see the unfairness of
the present voting system.
Local councils should make decisions that reflect a balance of the
wishes of the local people. The system should not allow any party a
disproportionate representation that does not even allow balanced,
alternative arguments to be presented.
It is not in anyone's interests in Glasgow for the SNP to obtain 22.8%
of the vote and one seat against 61.4% for Labour and 77 seats; in Perth
and Kinross for the Conservatives to obtain 24.8% and two seats against
41% and 18 seats for the SNP; in Angus for the SLD to obtain 6.9% of the
vote and two seats while Labour polled 15.5% and no seats. The examples
and permutations could go on.
It is said that people are turned off by politicians. One of the
reasons is that politicians have stopped listening to the arguments on
all sides and only listen to themselves.
No one person or single political party has all the answers. It is
time someone, somewhere, in power with the ability to act, had a bit of
vision to enable the voices and opinions of all people at least to be
heard.

DO I understand that a Lowlands type of English is to be recommended
as a true Scottish language? Why not that of Buchan, Orkneys, Borders --
or preferably Hebridean?
Why can the sponsors not admit that the peculiar style of our speech
is often simply basic English distorted by local accents?
Many Scottish words are simply throw backs to the years of illiteracy
-- often in official records -- altered by near-repeats over succeeding
generations.
Let us leave things alone. With our present system of education it
makes it quite hard enough to communicate in simple English.

REGISTERS of Scotland, one of the oldest public registers of land in
Europe, yesterday made a giant bound by advancing its method of working
from the seventeenth to the twenty-first century.
A computer system was launched at Meadowbank House, Edinburgh,
replacing the old system of writing property records laboriously by hand
into leather-bound tomes in the Sasine Register, which dated from 1617.
The new system, which was demonstrated during a visit by Mr George
Kynoch, the Scottish Office Industry Minister, will reduce conveyancing
costs.
Both the land register creation of text system and the digital mapping
system are expected to improve the service offered to solicitors,
surveyors, banks, estate agents, and others, expediting the production
time of land certificates.
The digital mapping system is said to be unique in the United Kingdom,
putting Scotland ahead of England in this field. It had been designed
and provided by Syntegra, the systems integration business of BT. The
cost is understood to be #2m.
Mr Alan Ramage, Keeper of the Registers of Scotland, said the digital
mapping system would allow the agency to cut costs and improve
efficiency. It was being used to draw, store, and print boundaries as an
overlay to existing digital ordnance survey maps.
Fife is the first county to which it will be applied. Preparations
have already begun for Aberdeen and Kincardine. All Scottish counties
are expected to be coered by the digital mapping system by 2003.
A personal computer-based land information system, provided by Siemens
Nixdorf Information Systems Ltd, which has won a #1m contract from
Registers of Scotland, will integrate with the digital mapping system to
record all land transactions and ownership issues throughout Scotland.

ROLLS-ROYCE staff, determined to save their skilled jobs at East
Kilbride, turned the screw on management with an overwhelming ballot for
industrial action yesterday.
The 600, mainly white-collar workers, facing redundancy will hold a
mass meeting today to consider a rolling programme of stoppages from
next week.
Shop stewards believe the company's worldwide aero-engine operations
could be crippled swiftly even without recourse to all-out strikes at
one of Scotland's best regarded engineering research and design centres.
Its closure, and transfer of work to Derby and Bristol later this
year, was announced in January.
Last night, it was understood that management now hopes to meet union
conveners today because of concerns arising from the threat of
industrial action.
In particular, Rolls-Royce's joint aero-engines project with BMW in
Germany is nearing a critical stage over deadlines. The East Kilbride
division also services and supplies spare parts for Tay, Spey, and Dart
engines, and any hiccups in operations could lead to the grounding of
commercial aircraft.
Mr Owen Thomas, chairman of the joint staff unions' committee,
described the ballot result as ''magnificent'' and added: ''We will be
going in hard to the company to save the jobs and the Scottish
division.''
Six unions took part in the ballot and more than 80% voted in favour
of industrial action.
The largest two, Manufacturing, Science, and Finance and the
Amalgamated Engineering union, whose members make up more than 80% of
threatened staff, backed the call by 92% and 93% respectively.
The other unions recorded at least 80% support, with the exception of
the Transport and General Workers' union, which has only 15 members in
the plant, six of whom voted in favour.
Seven days' notice of industrial action must be given to management,
and full-time union officials also have to approve and call the actions.
The week-long breathing space is designed to allow negotiated
settlements but Rolls-Royce -- regardless of today's eleventh-hour
meeting -- has never publicly signalled a U-turn under its relentless
drive to improve business performance and efficiency.
Options at today's mass meeting are expected to concentrate on tactics
leading up to one-day stoppages. Initial targets are expected to be
shift-working and overtime to disrupt the plant's tight schedules.
The company has sought weekend and even statutory-holiday working in a
bid to meet contracts, with up to 50-hours' overtime a week on offer.
Clearly, such flexibility to meet the healthy -- and profitable --
order book would be the first thing sacrificed in an escalating battle.
It is also likely that every worker will be involved in at least the
first action to underline the breadth of support within the complex.
Mr Thomas predicted any chosen tactic will have ''a dramatic effect''
on the company and warned: ''Action would bite on the first day.''
He added: ''There are a number of actions we can take without whole
days being involved. But we will do what is necessary to be most
effective.''
In the run-up to the ballot, management had warned that enhanced
redundancy packages could be scrapped along with any prospects of some
staff transferring to Derby or Bristol.
The unions believe Rolls-Royce will not carry out such threats in case
the current dispute is further exacerbated.
A company spokesman yesterday declined to comment on the ballot
result. He said: ''There is to be a meeting with management and shop
stewards tomorrow and it would be inappropriate to comment until after
that meeting.''
Next week sees the end of the company's 90-day consultation exercise
after announcing the division's closure. From Wednesday, April 20,
redundancies or transfers of work could take place.

What a scorcher? Not exactly, not yet, but the odd jersey was off
yesterday as Glasgow recorded its highest temperature of the year so far
of 15C (59F). About time too, with midsummer a matter of 10 weeks away.
Amid the sunshine, there was an unexpected shower as a burst water main
in Gallowgate produced a passable plaything for some of the local
youngsters. Until the man who'll soon be the Man from the Quango turned
up to turn it off.

Joanna Trollope, author of The Choir and other chronicles of
middle-class mores, took 20 years to become an overnight success. She
tells Lesley Duncan of the hard work that ensures her fame
Joanna Trollope: ''I'm not remotely interested in class per se. I am
interested in morality and psychology.''
Picture: IAN HOSSACK
HER family always refer to Anthony Trollope as ''the real Trollope''.
Joanna Trollope offers this information in an amused aside. In fact the
contemporary novelist -- a collateral descendant of the Trollopes of
Westminster (''the commercial lot'') -- threatens to outdo the
popularity of her nineteenth-century namesake.
Her latest novel, The Best of Friends, has been very well received. A
TV adaptation of The Choir is required viewing for stay-at-homes on
Sunday evenings (though Gloucester Cathedral is getting the best
notices). The adaptation of another novel -- A Village Affair -- goes
out in prime viewing time on Easter Monday.
In the course of a publicity tour for her new book, she paused briefly
at Glasgow's Copthorne Hotel one sunny morning last week. The ''blue
lake of hyacinths'' in George Square met with approval. She was,
however, indignant about something else.
Why, she demanded, had The Herald dropped Glasgow from its masthead?
This was not an outsider's idle question. The novelist of Middle
England's mores and emotions has strong connections with the city. Her
grandmother was one of the first women students at Glasgow School of
Art. Her mother in turn studied there. Her great-grandfather, James
Hedderwick, was responsible for fund-raising for the present Glasgow
Royal Infirmary buildings. Joanna Trollope herself, though brought up
mostly in Surrey, spent childhood Easter holidays in Oakfield Avenue,
beside Glasgow University.
Trollope has sometimes been evaluated rather patronisingly. Her
intellectual and academic credentials would outshine those of many
critics. She went to ''a most excellent grammar school of the kind that
Shirley Williams put paid to'' and thence to Oxford. There she studied
English language and literature. It was an era when T S Eliot was
regarded as an enfant terrible. Robert Graves was Professor of Poetry.
Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton came to town to dazzle in Marlowe's
Doctor Faustus.
Reflecting on these student days, Trollope says she has always been
''rather hampered by being conscientious''. She handed in essays on
time; attended lectures. This latter activity could be subversive, since
lecturers without a quorum of students could cancel their courses. ''I
felt my earnest bespectacled face kept them at it!''
Her student life was much involved with the theatre, talking, and
friendships. She didn't act. ''I was this height when I was 12,'' she
says, indicating her long, elegant frame, clad in honey-coloured jacket
and trousers. ''I did useful things backstage.''
After Oxford, she saw her life in conventional terms of marriage,
children, and career. The last took her into the Foreign Office. Then
she qualified as a teacher and taught for 12 years. She didn't start
writing with an eye to publishing until her younger daughter was two.
''It has taken me over 20 years to become an overnight success,'' she
says dryly.
She thinks that writers ''do need to get quite a lot of life under
their belts''. She herself has been writing contemporary fiction only
since 1987. Her earlier historical novels had, however, been very useful
as an apprenticeship. She did ''a tremendous amount of research'' for
her two favourites. The Steps of the Sun, set in the Boer War period,
involved ''a lot of crawling about the battlefields in South Africa''.
For the other, City of Gems, she visited Burma 14 or 15 years ago,
looming above the locals and no doubt doubly conspicuous as one of the
few foreign travellers there that year.
She has taken this habit of research into her contemporary novels, of
which The Best of Friends is the seventh. If she comes across a pocket
of modern life she doesn't know about -- for example working in a
supermarket -- she will go and research it. ''I want the reality of
these novels to strike the reader.''
Does she view it as criticism or compliment to be pigeonholed as the
chronicler of middle-class provincial England? ''I'm not remotely
interested in class per se,'' she replies. ''I am interested in morality
and psychology.'' Like Roddy Doyle writing about Dublin, she sets her
books in familiar territory -- to set them anywhere else would be
presumptuous.
She considers that she is writing ''traditional fiction''. She points
to the polarisation of fiction in the last 25 years: on the one hand
intellectual, literary, philosophical, prizewinning fiction -- ''much of
it absolutely wonderful'' but slightly despising narrative; on the other
hand airport blockbusters that rather despise real characterisation.
''The traditional novel makes a celebration of both.''
The reason her novels have struck such a chord, Joanna Trollope
thinks, is that readers can not only relax with them -- ''I hope they're
quite readable'' -- but can, in a sense, confide in them.
As proof of this, she receives many letters from readers. The previous
Saturday morning's post had brought three, saying what a help her novels
had been in some way or another. Trollope is quick to add: ''That makes
me sound rather smug even to quote that, but it's really a measure, not
so much of the novels themselves, as of the kind of novels they are.''
The other quality of traditional fiction, Trollope says, is to leave
you something to think about. I point out that The Best of Friends has a
surprisingly harsh, bleak ending. Joanna Trollope doesn't believe her
novels are cosy, smug, escapist. ''I think they're all quite bleak. I
haven't got a happy ending to my name!''
The most touching relationship in her latest book is between two old
people, the flamboyant Vi and neat, nautical Dan. ''I've seen the very
thing in my own family,'' says Trollope. The other endearing characters
in The Best of Friends are three teenage brothers, particularly the
lovelorn Gus. However, even he loses his idealistic attachment at the
end. Trollope remarks on ''that terrible callousness even in the
sweetest and most romantic of boys and men when their ardour has
cooled''.
Of the three generations, the emotional cantrips of the middle-aged
quartet in The Best of Friends elicit least sympathy. Trollope agrees.
''I think the middle generation are the ones who have taken advantage of
this received wisdom about self-fulfilment to an almost exaggerated
degree. I don't blame them but I can't help observing it's made a lot of
my age group behave very unattractively. I include myself in all of
this.''
She comments on the extraordinary nature of middle-aged
falling-in-love. It comes in unwanted, ''like a fireball'', making
someone very kind and reasonable suddenly deaf to all rational
suggestions and responsibilities.
The trouble about being abandoned, on the other hand, is that ''you do
need to say the same things over and over again like a stuck record''.
The tiresome Gina demonstrates this in The Best of Friends. She is also
the client of an enigmatic counsellor. Trollope thinks counselling is
desperately needed (drawing a chilling moral from the First World War),
but says of the legions of middle-aged women entering the profession,
''I'd just like to know exactly what sort of complicated psychological
baggage they're taking into this business.''
She regrets what she hopes is just the temporary eclipse of religion.
''I don't just think people suffer psychologically without it, but
aesthetically.'' She herself was born into the Church of England and has
remained ''rather peacefully and quietly'' inside it. She thinks it does
diminish humankind to be without religion. ''I'm aware this is a very
unfashionable view intellectually but there we are,'' she says, ending
with her characteristic laugh.
Trollope also thinks that religion is a good thing for anyone
creative. ''It keeps you in your place. There's no danger of the ego
turning into a loose cannon.''
It also helps to be female. ''I think the female ego is usually in
quite stern control, don't you?'' I concur. Nor do women ''have much of
an inclination to say we know best''. This, she points out, applies to
her novels too. She lays out her scenario -- moral, emotional, sexual --
without being overtly judgmental, though you may glean that she is
fonder of some characters than others.
When not traversing the country, Trollope lives in a Gloucestershire
village with her second husband, the playwright Ian Curteis, two dogs,
two cats, six hens, and a cockerel. Their family -- two stepsons and her
own two daughters -- are all in their twenties and have their own homes.
Their occupations range from fresco restorer and chef (the boys) to
barrister and ''incipient high-class charity worker'' (the girls).
Cool, articulate, surprisingly humorous, Trollope has yet another side
to her talents. She also writes, under the pseudonym Caroline Harvey,
''what I believe is known in the trade, unattractively, as period
romances.''

#15.99.

A DISTRICT council has confirmed what local people have been saying
for years.
The noise of the bells in Montrose Steeple, which chime 284 times each
night at 10pm, is a nuisance.
Angus District Council carried out tests last week and now they have
asked the local community council for a decision.
Some council members, who do not live next to the bells, want to keep
them for sentimental reasons.
Other people want the bells muffled during the night.
Across the street from the steeple, offshore oil worker Peter Fosyth,
31, the brother of Scottish Tory MP Michael Forsyth, said: ''It's like
living next to a railway line.
''If I go to my bed before 10pm, the bells wake me up. ''The bells go
mad at that time and it's a bad time of night when you are trying to get
young children to sleep. These bells are a pain. Something should be
done.''
Local hotelier Joyce Reid, of the Corner House Hotel, said: ''We have
been complaining about these bells for 25 years.
''We have spent a fortune on sound baffling and have lost a lot of
business after complaints from the oil companies.
''Now, at last, the council has conducted the tests and proved that
there is a problem. Even if they just stopped the quarterly bells, which
ring three times an hour, it would be a help.
Community council chairwoman Julie Strachan said: ''Personally, I feel
that the bells should be muffled, or stopped between 10pm and 7am if
people are having their sleep disturbed.
''The district council have said that they did not want to lose the
bells altogether, because of Hogmanay, and people are used to the 10pm
curfew bell which has sounded since the war.''

Abigail's party may
have been a drag,
but as theatre, it's
still a tour de force.
The male director
and star of a new
production talks to
JOHN LINKLATER
Picture: PHIL RIDER
Grant Smeaton as Beverly in Abigail's Party: ''I try not to make it
like a drag act. It's just exploring the female side of the
personality.''
THESE gold slingbacks are killing him. They cut into him, but he is a
trouper. He carries on without so much as betraying a wince, making it
through to the end. The moment the first dress run-through finishes,
though, Grant Smeaton seizes the chance to tear off the shoes and nurse
his raw feet.
''Oh Gawd. These shoes.'' That's what he says. Not a line from the
play, but it could have been easily. It is Abigail's Party. Grant
Smeaton is directing. He is also playing the part of Beverly. You
remember Beverly, yeah? You remember Beverly: Okay Laurence? Okay Ang?
Okay Sue? Okay Tone? Yeah? Fantastic.
As Beverly he is wearing huge fake sapphire drop ear-rings. He has a
chunky gold-link necklace. The ash-blonde wig fits over his
close-cropped, receding hairline. All of that is fine. The trouble here
is with these shoes. They are strappy high-heels, pure retro-70s. Would
tights help his feet? Nope. Jill Riddiford, who is playing Angela,
suggests not. ''If you wear tights with high heels you just slip
forward,'' she advises. ''Unless you have sweaty feet.''
In the last week of rehearsal it is usually more than just the feet
that go sweaty. ''I'm used to heels a little bit, I suppose,'' concedes
Smeaton later, ''having played Mrs Prentice in What The Butler Saw in
1990 at The Arches. That was the first one I did. I was directing it and
the actress dropped out of it, so I ended up playing her. Way back I
used to do Berlin-type cabaret with Ross Stenhouse, and me doing female
impersonations. Brecht kind of stuff. Film noir sort of stuff as well,
with bits from Double Indemnity and All About Eve. We'll be doing that
again as The Kit-Kat Club at Blackfriars during Mayfest.''
Beverly is different. When Alison Steadman created the character,
working through 1977 improvisations with her director husband Mike
Leigh, she was awesome. Television viewers of the Play For Today
production saw how the stage creature loomed even larger. There was an
argument that she was already more drag queen than dragon in an
unforgettable performance by Steadman that has cast an intimidating
shadow over all subsequent attempts to revive the role. Beverly is a big
character.
''I try not to make it like a drag act,'' says Smeaton. ''I don't do
drag us such. It's just exploring the female side of the personality.
There is that duality in everbody, I think, distinctions between
masculinity and femininity. It's interesting to explore that. Maybe it's
a bit too much for people to take. A bit too close to home. I don't
know.
''With the female side you can do things you can't with the male side.
Hidden depths. You can be more bitchy, and go to town with it. Females
can sometimes be more draggy than males. But I remember little parties
when I was growing up, with the cocktail sticks and the cheesey
pineapples. Aunties getting a bit too drunk, and doing the whole Beverly
thing.''
In 1995 the play has acquired a new and unexpected pathos. It is still
comic, still very black, but we begin to recognize a sense of passing, a
glimpse of a different society in its last spasms, in this portrayal of
lives of stuttering desperation. If it is a play about failed
communication, which of course it is, it portrays an era when people
still thought they should at least be seen to be trying. It is a
disaster, degenerating into pathetic status games, snobberies and
calculated digs, but a disaster out of an attempt.
If Mike Leigh set out to devise the same piece, from the same premise,
he would have to confront the reality that on Richmond Street off the
Ravensway, or whatever other new urban estate he chose, people no longer
pretend to conceal their isolation. Abigail wouldn't be having a party
in her mother's house. Laurence would still be at the office. Tony would
be a blue ghost in front of his computer terminal. Angela would be
sleeping through Blind Date. Sue would be reading Sun Myung Moon. And
Beverly . . . Beverly would hardly have noticed. She would be floating
around the room talking to the plants.
''It's Beverly's little act that she's doing in the show,'' says
Smeaton. ''She's the 'actress' who has to keep the whole thing moving
along. You find people like that, but they're not real. She's stuck in
there, depending on Laurence to provide her with the life she probably
doesn't even want.''
The decision to present the play in its 1970s setting was therefore
forced, but it has the bonus of throwing in an awful lot of kitsch in
costume and design: leather jackets crinkling against leather setees,
wide lapels, kipper ties, sheepskin rugs, glasstop tables and a
rotisserie in the kitchen. It's Donna Summer, Barry White and aerosol
fresheners. It's pinky red lipstick and crimsony pink polka dots. A lot
of 70s colour in there.
The show opens for 12 nights at The Arches Theatre today. It is a
first production for Tangerine, formed by Smeaton with Ross Stenhouse
(playing Laurence) and Raymond Burke (co-directing) out of the success
of Hopscotch, which has been making a growing impression in
theatre-in-education since it was founded eight years ago, and it
recently picked one of the first grants from the National Lottery. It
was for #20,000. Abigail's Party, ''a seriously black comedy for a
seriously black society'', will also go to the Gilded Baloon for the
Edinburgh Festival.
Abigail's Party at The Arches Theatre, April 11-23.

STARS of television and radio turned out in force yesterday to pay
their last respects at the funeral of Kenny Everett.
The zany disc-jockey and comedian died in his sleep last Tuesday from
an Aids-related illness. He was 50.
Among the mourners at the Church of the Immaculate Conception, in
Mayfair, west London, was Terry Wogan, who said: ''It's a happy ending
-- I just give thanks for his life and I'm sure he will be happy in the
next life.''
The coffin was carried into the church, covered in yellow flowers.
Among wreaths was one with a card saying from ''Petal Bum''.
It was an ultra-traditional funeral service, with full Requiem Mass,
for one of the showbusiness world's least traditional stars, who turned
his back on TV fame with his Kenny Everett Video Show to present a show
on the London oldies radio station, Capital Gold.
Hioowever, Kenny Everett had been consoled by his Catholic faith in
his final weeks and had approached death with integrity and courage,
said the Rev William Hofton, who conducted the ceremony.
Mr Hofton told the congregation: ''I rely on the fact that God has the
most wonderful sense of humour. Anyone who gets given the gift of
laughter and humour will be a very welcome guest in heaven.''
He imagined the comedian whispering his life story in God's ear and
bringing ''a wonderful smile'' to his face.
Chris Tarrant, Mike Read, Paul Gambaccini, and Tony Blackburn joined
members of Everett's family, including his ex-wife, Lee, for the
ceremony.
The comedian's parents, Thomas and Elizabeth, who live in Perth,
Western Australia, were unable to attend but his sister, Mrs Kate
Horgan, who made the journey from Australia to nurse him in his last
weeks, was there, along with her husband, Conor, and daughter Joanna,
who recited bidding prayers.
Many of Kenny Everett's friends and former colleagues entered the
church by the back door to avoid publicity -- his family had been keen
to keep the service low key.
His manager and friend, Jo Gurnett, who was with him when he died,
read the lesson. Hymns included The Lord's My Shepherd and songs from
the choir in Latin.
Other friends who attended the funeral, which was followed by a
cremation, included TV presenter Noel Edmonds, DJs Alan Freeman and
David Hamilton, actress Patricia Hayes, DJ comedian Christopher Biggins,
and hypnotist Paul McKenna.
The Liverpool-born DJ began his career on the sixties' pirate station,
Radio London, working at Radio Luxembourg and Radio One before joining
London's Capital Radio in the 70s. In his hit TV shows of the 1980s he
played a number of wacky characters, including busty blonde Cupid Stunt
and biker Sid Snot.
Two years before he died, he acknowledged publicly that he was HIV
positive -- but he never lost his sense of humour.
* Other high-profile figures from the world of entertainment to have
succumbed to Aids include rock singer Freddie Mercury, who lived near
Everett in Kensington, ice skater John Curry, and Chariots of Fire star
Ian Charleson.

TWO leading environmental groups yesterday backed decisions by
Scottish Secretary Ian Lang which protect Edinburgh's green belt,
currently under threat from commercial and housing developments.
The Association for the Protection of Rural Scotland and the Cockburn
Association said it was vital green belts throughout Scotland were
retained.
Over the past four weeks, planning appeals by developers to site
superstores and to build two housing developments on Edinburgh's green
belt have been rejected by Mr Lang.
However, the Cockburn Association warned environmentalists to be
vigilant over new planning applications on similar sites in their area.
It appealed to local communities to make extra checks because of the
changes in local government.
Mr Terry Levinthal, secretary of the association said: ''Communities,
especially in cities like Glasgow and places like Ayr must keep a close
look at what is happening on their green-belt areas.
''Areas round cities are always under threat and checks must be always
made, especially now with the changes under way in local government who
deal with planning applications.
''For instance, the Edinburgh green belt is one of the smallest green
belts in the UK and it is subjected to great development pressure.''
Ms Elizabeth Garland, manager of APRS, said: ''We have campaigned for
a clear commitment to green-belt protection from inappropriate
development. There is a need to ensure that the green belt around
Edinburgh is not eroded or fragmented by development that flies in the
face of adopted planning policy.''

CONSERVATIVE Party managers are actively considering launching a
tit-for-tat legal action against the BBC in the run-up to next month's
local elections in England and Wales.
A senior party source yesterday confirmed that there was a possibility
the party would seek an injuction if the corporation decides to
broadcast full coverage of the Labour Party's special conference on
Clause 4, due to take place only days before the polls.
The move is being prompted as a response to last week's broadcast ban
at the Court of Session in Edinburgh. The court upheld Labour and
Liberal Democrat demands to stop the showing of the Prime Minister's
interview on BBC1's Panorama on the eve of the Scottish elections.
A spokesman for Conservative Central Office in London said: ''At the
moment, we are not ruling anything in and not ruling anything out.
''There is not a great deal I can say about this. It will be a party
matter if anything. There are still three weeks if the BBC decide to go
ahead with it.''
Mr Phil Gallie, Conservative MP for Ayr, said he would support an
injuction against the BBC. ''It seems to me that this is a logical step
to be taken as obviously this broadcast would give the Labour Party a
lot of publicity and give great encouragement to their supporters.
''The same arguments used against John Major's interview would seem to
apply here.
''I support this without a doubt though I wouldn't be doing so had not
the Labour Party and Liberal Party taken such a single-minded view.''
Labour MP John McFall said he thought it unlikely an injunction would
succeed. ''The Tories are showing their amazing ignorance of what the
judgment in Scotland was. The court looked at the issue of balance over
the previous five weeks.
''If they look at balance within the five weeks previous in England
then I am sure the broadcast of the Labour Party conference will go
ahead.''
Mr McFall said he did not regret the Scottish court move despite the
prospect of losing coverage of the Clause 4 conference. ''I think this
just illustrates the Tories' pettiness.''
A spokesman for the BBC in London confirmed the corporation was
planning to broadcast coverage of the conference. He said he did know of
any plans to try to stop the programme.
''We haven't heard anything about it, therefore we can't comment,'' he
said.

MANUFACTURERS in Scotland favour the status quo rather than
constitutional change, according to a survey, the results of which are
published today.
On export prospects, 37% of firms said devolution would be harmful,
rising to 53% under independence.
However, 57% felt that devolution would make no difference to their
own individual operations, while 47% were of the same opinion about the
effects of a full break from the Union.
The status quo was the option least likely to make any difference to
personal prospects, according to 78% of the firms.
The Gallup poll, for international couriers DHL, also found that
export confidence in Scotland was greater than for the UK as a whole --
with more than seven in 10 having ''good or excellent expectations'' of
orders over the next 12 months. DHL described the rise in export
confidence as encouraging.
Scottish firms were more concerned about EU red tape than their UK
counterparts.
EU edicts had a ''negative effect'' on 13% of Scottish export firms,
compared with 8% for the UK, according to the survey of 827 companies,
including 269 in Scotland.
Only 32% of Scottish companies thought a European currency would help
their businesses, compared with 37% elsewhere.

NATIVE Americans yesterday began face-to-face negotiations with
Glasgow museum officials for the return of a sacred Ghost Shirt removed
from the body of one of the victims of the Wounded Knee massacre.
Delegates later expressed confidence that the Ghost Shirt would
eventually be handed over and they even hinted that they might come to
some arrangement with Glasgow about lending and borrowing museum
exhibits.
The garment was taken from the body of a member of the Lakota Sioux
after the US Army slaughtered more than 200 men, women, and children at
Wounded Knee in December, 1890.
The victims had been gathering for a Ghost Dance, a ritual to bring
back the spirits of their ancestors, the vanished buffalo, and their
traditional way of life.
The shirt came to Glasgow a couple of years after the massacre when it
was sold by an interpreter travelling with Buffalo Bill's Wild West
Show.
As first exclusively revealed in The Herald, members of the Wounded
Knee Survivors' Association began a campaign for the return of the shirt
after it was spotted at an exhibition by a Native American visiting
Glasgow in 1992.
Letters have gone back and forth since then but now the association
has sent delegates to Scotland. Yesterday, they held talks with
officials from Glasgow District Council's department of museums and art
galleries at Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, where the Ghost Shirt
is on display.
Delegation leader Mario Gonzalez, a lawyer and expert on aboriginal
rights, later described the negotiations as ''very positive'' and
stressed the ''mutual understanding and respect'' between the two sides.
The talks covered not only the Ghost Shirt but also some other items,
including ceremonial pipes, held by the museums department. Mr Gonzalez
said: ''I feel that eventually we will arrive at an agreement where
these items can be repatriated to the rightful owners.
''There are legal reasons why they should be returned but the ethical
and moral reasons are the strongest.
''We are suggesting to the museum that we may enter in to a long-term
relationship where we may exchange and loan each other items. We are
planning to build a museum of our own.''
Mr Mark O'Neill, the department's senior curator of history, described
the meeting as ''very moving and informative'' and said the delegation
had made a strong case for the return of the items.
However, he added: ''We made the point that we have an obligation to
educate our public about the history of the world through the objects we
have in our collection. Our dilemma is to reconcile the rights we
acknowledge that the Lakota have to these objects and our duties to our
citizens.''
The talks are continuing.
The delegation included another Native American lawyer, Mr John Earl,
who sparked the whole campaign after seeing the Ghost Shirt in a Home of
the Brave exhibition at Glasgow's McLellan Galleries.

THE couple at the centre of the three-in-a-bed sex allegations which
led to the resignation of Tory MP Richard Spring have been suspended
from their jobs, it was disclosed last night.
The life assurance and pension company National Provident Institution
said executive Chris Holmes and clerical worker Ms Odette Nightingale
would remain on full pay while an inquiry was held.
The move came after Mr Spring quit as parliamentary private-secretary
to Northern Ireland Minister Sir Patrick Mayhew in the wake of claims by
Ms Nightingale about an alleged sex romp involving herself, Mr Holmes,
and the MP.
Mr Spring, 48, a divorced father of two and MP for Bury St Edmunds,
was said by Ms Nightingale also to have made indiscreet comments about
the sex lives of the Prime Minister and members of the royal family.
In a statement, NPI's public relations manager John Fisher said:
''Pending a full investigation, Christopher Holmes and Odette
Nightingale have been suspended on full pay.''
The company refused to elaborate but it was thought NPI decided to act
out of concern for its public image.
Mr Holmes, 48, who has worked for NPI since 1971, is a #120,000-a-year
assistant general manager in charge of assets, a key role in the
company.
His responsibilities are being temporarily taken over by another
executive.
Ms Nightingale, 30, a divorced mother-of-two, is a clerical assistant
with NPI and also a Sunday schoolteacher.
Both were thought to have booked yesterday off in advance of the
appearance of the allegations in Sunday's News of the World.
Mr Holmes was reported to have said he feared the story could end his
career at NPI.
He was said to have told a London-based tabloid yesterday that he had
spoken to the MP on the telephone on Sunday and they had agreed they had
been allegedly set up.
He allegedly said: ''Richard is an old pal but he won't be a friend
now because he obviously blames me for all this. I would if I was him.
''He'll be thinking, 'Christ, that's my career at an end.'
He added: ''Richard rang me and asked me if I'd seen the story. I
said, 'Yes', and told him, 'It looks like we have been set up.'
''What crossed my mind was his job in Northern Ireland and security.
''I don't know whether it was MI5 who taped us but it's a possibility.
We were bugged from outside before the, you know. We were definitely set
up.''

THE managing director of an opencast coal mine was seriously ill in
hospital last night after an accident at his company's site at
Newarthill in Lanarkshire.
Mr John O'Connor, of Main Street, Bridgeton, Glasgow, was inspecting
the Cochrane Mining company's site at Mossbank Farm early yesterday when
a large boulder -- almost the size of a small van -- slid, pinning him
by the legs.
A tractor shovel was used to hold back piles of rock while 52-year-old
Mr O'Connor was released.
He was taken to Monklands General Hospital where he underwent major
surgery.
The accident is being investigated by police and safety officials.
Meanwhile, an investigation is to be held into a building site
accident after a man was trapped for more than an hour under a concrete
block.
Mr Alan Dalrymple, from Airdrie, was working on a G A Construction
site in Glasgow on Sunday, when a concrete block suspended from a crane
fell and pinned him to the ground. He was freed by a surgical team from
Glasgow Royal Infirmary and was in a stable condition last night.

A MAN arrested after Dundee United player Billy McKinlay was struck by
the match ball at Brockville will not be prosecuted.
The Scotland international midfielder was hit when the ball was hurled
back from the Falkirk fans' enclosure on Saturday.
Police detained a man -- believed to be a civil servant -- and
submitted a report to the procurator-fiscal.
Yesterday, Falkirk's depute procurator-fiscal, Mr Alastair McSporran,
said: ''I have received a report from police on the incident. As a
result, no-one will be appearing in court.''
The incident happened in the 52nd minute of the Premier League clash.
McKinlay ran to the touchline to take a throw-in after the ball had
gone out of play. A spectator said: ''The ball came bulleting back from
point-blank range and hit McKinlay.''
Referee Jim McGilvray, of Edinburgh, alerted police to the incident.
They moved into the crowd and arrested a fan yards from the playing
surface. Later, police interviewed McKinlay and team mate Dave Bowman.

<TEXT>
A SENIOR Labour MP yesterday demanded a top-level inquiry into new
allegations that Mrs Margaret Thatcher's office as Prime Minister may
have been used to further her son, Mark's, business career.
Mr Doug Hoyle, chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party, called on
Lord Justice Scott -- whose report on the arms-to-Iraq affair is awaited
-- to investigate claims of ''patronage being exercised at the very
highest level''.
He said Prime Minister John Major will face Commons questions
immediately after the Easter recess on what would be ''an absolutely
disgraceful affair'' if proved correct.
The allegations are in a new book, Thatcher's Gold, by Paul Halloran
and Mark Hollingsworth, serialised by the Mail on Sunday.
A claim is made that Mr Mark Thatcher used a handwritten note from his
mother to further his business career. The Mail on Sunday said the note,
under an official photograph of the then Mrs Thatcher when Prime
Minister, was addressed to Sheikh Zayed, ruler of Abu Dhabi and
president of the United Arab Emirates.
It read: ''I have asked my son to convey to you my personal message of
warm regards and good wishes.''
The paper said that, months after Mr Thatcher presented the note,
written in November 1980, to the sheikh, he helped secure a #300m Middle
East building contract for Cementation International, and that his own
commission was nearly #3m.
Three years later, in 1984, Mrs Thatcher was questioned in the Commons
about ''batting for a single firm in which a member of my own family had
a direct financial interest in the outcome''.
She said: ''It is quite untrue. Your complaint is unjustified . . .
and I hope therefore you will withdraw your untrue allegation.''
The Mail on Sunday reported: ''Whether Mrs Thatcher intended it or
not, the note . . . would have been a considerable asset for Mark in any
future business dealings in the Arab world, where personal status and
influence count for so much.''
Ministers' rules on the way Government business is conducted state:
''Ministers must so order their affairs that no conflict arises or
appears to arise between their private interest and their public
duties.''
The paper also reported that Mr Thatcher was a ''prime mover'' in a
plan to make Lady Thatcher president of the Arab-owned Bank of Credit
and Commerce International only months before it collapsed after one of
the biggest frauds in history.
The plan, devised in 1990 when Lady Thatcher was still in office, fell
apart when Sheikh Zayed, a co-founder of BCCI, declined to co-operate.
Mr Hoyle, MP for Warrington North, said yesterday: ''If proved, this
is an absolutely disgraceful affair and -- once again, if proved -- it
shows patronage has been exercised at the very highest level.''
* Pictures of Lady Thatcher emerging from her London home yesterday
show her looking gaunt and even slightly haggard, as though bound up
with anxiety. Some of her acquaintances say she has outwardly aged
enormously over the past six to nine months.
It is known that she has been deeply concerned about the media
spotlight which has been focusing without mercy for months on her son's
business activities and allegations of her own involvement, however
unwitting, in them -- allegations she has fiercely denied.
Lady Thatcher's appearance on the platform at the Conservative Party
conference last October shocked her supporters. For the first time
tell-tale wrinkles were plainly visible on her face and neck.
She had suddenly begun to look her age -- and more. Lady Thatcher will
be 70 next October. Yesterday's pictures will be a source of further
worry to her admirers.

BRITAIN'S major white-collar unions have won a reprieve for thousands
of staff, including more than 200 at Grangemouth who work for Zeneca,
the pharmaceutical and agricultural chemicals firm.
National officers for MSF, the TGWU, GMB/Apex, and EESA have persuaded
the company not to implement a union de-recognition policy which would
have brought an effective end to collective bargaining and substituted a
scheme of merit rises and performance-related pay.
Staff throughout the country staged a demonstration in January to
protest against Zeneca's plans.
Mr Ian Fulton, MSF's Scottish regional officer, said yesterday:
''Talks at high level are still under way. But the company seems to have
backed off for the moment. Negotiations on pay and conditions will be
conducted as usual by union officials at national level.
''Zeneca was flying in the face of public opinion. There is clear
backing for the right of people to be represented by a union if they
chose to do so. This kind of arbitrary negation of rights would not be
allowed in any other EU country except the UK.''
As reported in The Herald last week, senior officers from the Scottish
TUC are currently seeking a meeting with the management of BP to try to
end a similar programme of union de-recognition at the company's
Grangemouth refinery.

<TEXT>
A FORMER leading policeman told a court yesterday of his ''shock,
humiliation, and shame'' at being accused of shoplifting.
Mr Graham Wyn Jones, 50, one-time Metropolitan Assistant Commissioner,
said the ''absolute nightmare'' worsened when he was ''manhandled''
across the store, with one arm twisted behind his back, to the manager's
office.
Minutes later, when a store detective and a security guard at Marks &amp;
Spencer in Kings Road, Chelsea, thought he was trying to flee, he was
again grabbed, and during a struggle his trousers came undone.
''I was absolutely distraught. I was shocked. I was horrified. I
didn't know what was happening,'' he told Southwark Crown Court.
Mr Jones, who said he was shopping for a dinner party at home that
evening, denies stealing two bottles of wine, two pieces of cheese, and
a packet of chicken breasts worth #24 in March last year.
Mr Richard McGregor-Johnson, prosecuting, had earlier told the court
that when Mr Jones, of Eaton Terrace, Belgravia, central London, was
arrested, he had #1700 on him.
The barrister said the former policeman, who left his #67,000-a-year
post in December, 1993, was first spotted wheeling a couple of M&amp;S
carrier bags through the store in a trolley.
A store detective keeping an eye on him then allegedly saw him putting
the wine, cheese, and chicken into one of the bags before leaving the
store without paying for them.
In evidence, however, Mr Jones said: ''I have never stolen anything in
my life.''
He complained that, apart from his rough treatment which left him with
a sore arm and neck, no-one explained what was happening until he had
been escorted to the manager's office.
During lengthy questioning Mr Jones was asked why, when first
interviewed, he said he had paid for everything he had, but on a second
occasion suggested he might have made his purchases at a total of three
M&amp;S stores in London.
He explained that he had put forward the multiple store scenario only
as a ''possibility not a probability'' when he later recalled he had
visited other stores that day.
Although he could not remember his movements with absolute certainty,
he felt it was most likely all the grocery purchases had been made in
the Chelsea store.
He told the jury that he had embarked on his shopping trip with
different lists for different meals, later explaining: ''I am such an
ill-disciplined shopper.''
As far as he could remember, he first bought some of the things he
needed, then went through the checkouts a second and possibly a third
time after more purchases.
There could have been a fourth tour of the store while he checked
whether the things he had were precisely what he had been ''instructed''
to get. He believed that was when the store detective mistakenly thought
he was stealing.
He told his counsel, Mr Jeremy Donne, that his fears about the
publicity that would result were justified when one national newspaper
published the story of his arrest the next day with the headline: ''Top
cop held in theft quiz''.
Mr Jones told Mr McGregor-Johnson that he had not mentioned his visits
to other Marks &amp; Spencer stores when he was first questioned by police
because he was specifically trying to answer the store detective's
allegations.
The barrister put to him: ''You left the store without paying for
those goods.'' Mr Jones replied: ''I did not. All the goods in my
possession I had paid for.''
The trial continues.

SCOTTISH football's decline has prompted the return of former Scottish
Football Association secretary Ernie Walker, who will head a review body
which will recommend sweeping changes within the domestic game in an
attempt to catch up with the rest of the world.
Mr Walker will chair the Independent Review Body for Scottish Football
and will have absolute power in appointing his team, which will have a
two to three-year lifespan at the end of which a blueprint for the
future will be handed over.
''The independent body will comprise eminent people from Scottish life
and will also include a couple of people from abroad,'' said Mr Walker,
who was SFA secretary for 13 years before standing down five years ago.
He will work closely with supporters.
''In my opinion, we seem to have fallen behind most of the rest of the
world. In recent weeks, I have watched matches involving Barcelona,
Paris St Germain, and AC Milan and, compared with what we saw at Hampden
on Saturday, we are watching two different things.
''It was clear one was a football match and the other was a contest of
some description.''
Neither Hearts nor Airdrie, who played out a typical Scottish Cup tie,
will be charmed by Mr Walker's words but personal feelings will not
prevent him from doing his job.
The SFA members might not be safe either, because Mr Walker's group
could recommend strict pruning of that body which has been in existence
for 122 years. ''It's like a tree that has grown many different
branches,'' he said. ''It probably seems to be choking and needs
ventilating. It may be we will decide the council itself has to go or
that the chief executive should be sacked if he is not seen to be doing
the job.''
The SFA's chief executive, Mr Jim Farry, was sitting further along the
table.
Mr Walker, who recently stood down as chairman of the Scottish Health
Education Council, will begin work as quickly as possible.

A SCOTTISH Office plan to give bingo enthusiasts the chance to get
their eyes down on a Sunday afternoon for the first time in nearly 30
years provoked an angry response from senior Church officials yesterday.
The decision to allow the practice from later this year did not
''clickety click'' with representatives of the Church of Scotland and
the Roman Catholic Church, who argued that it amounted to ''a further
erosion of Christian traditions in Scotland''.
Since the introduction of the Gaming Act 1968, Scotland's licensed
bingo halls have been permitted to open on Sundays only between 7.30pm
and 11pm, unlike their counterparts south of the Border which are
allowed to stage Sunday afternoon and evening bingo sessions.
Before 1968, it is understood bingo halls were allowed to open at
their own discretion.
Scottish Office Minister Lord Fraser of Carmyllie yesterday announced
the Government's intention to lay before Parliament an Order under the
Deregulation and Contracting Out Act, 1994, which will allow 91 licensed
bingo clubs in Scotland to open on Sunday afternoons.
The exact date of the change and new hours of opening are not expected
to be confirmed until the matter has been before Parliament.
The decision follows just four months after Scotland's supermarkets
and off-licences were allowed to sell alcohol on a Sunday for the first
time following the relaxation of Government legislation.
Lord Fraser said the views of a wide range of people in Scotland,
including local authorities, churches, police, and other interested
parties, had been sought before the decision affecting bingo clubs was
reached.
He added: ''The Government sees this proposal as a further step
towards achieving a reasonable balance between the freedom of the
individual to enjoy Sunday afternoon in the way he or she wishes and the
equal right of others to enjoy the traditional Scottish Sunday.''
However, the convener of the Church of Scotland's Board of Social
Responsibility, the Rev Bill Wallace, said yesterday that he very much
regretted that the Government had ignored the Church's representations
by allowing bingo halls to open on a Sunday afternoon.
''This is a further erosion of our Christian traditions in Scotland,''
he said. ''It is something we find very disappointing but not surprising
given the Government's determination to remove legislation that
preserves Sunday as a special day.
''We made our views known to the Government on the relaxing of the
legislation but once again our views have just been ignored.''
Father Tom Connelly, press officer for the Roman Catholic Church in
Scotland, said: ''I find the decision hard to fathom given the
Government's supposed support for family values.
''Quite clearly many people who previously may have had the afternoon
off will be obliged to work in bingo halls on a Sunday.
''It is a pity that on this one day, when families might have had the
opportunity of being together, another outside attraction is introduced
to drive them away from each other.''
Predictably, the Scottish Office announcement was welcomed by the
Bingo Association of Great Britain.
Its general secretary, Ms Joanne Matt, said: ''Afternoon bingo
sessions generally attract older people, many of whom are reluctant to
go out at night, especially during the winter. This decision will go a
long way to pleasing them.''
Mr Graham Kerr, managing director of Paramount, which recently opened
a #2.5m bingo hall in Possilpark, Glasgow, appeared unperturbed by the
Church reaction and the possibility that the Scottish Office decision
could lead to a further erosion of Christian traditions.
''That is not for me to consider but is more importantly a
consideration for the people of Scotland,'' he said.
''It is quite clear from the reaction to changes in Sunday retailing
in Scotland over the past 20 years that people have decided the kind of
Sunday they want to have. This is simply a very small part of the same
process.''

A LOTTERY ticket holder who missed out on a fortune has shot himself,
it emerged last night.
The death of Mr Tim O'Brien, who picked the same numbers every week,
is thought to be the first such suicide.
Camelot, the organisers, described the case as a ''tragic story''.
Mr O'Brien, 51, who has two sons, apparently killed himself when he
realised that his numbers had come up at the weekend -- but his advance
purchase had expired so he did not have a valid ticket for a share of
the #8m jackpot.
On Sunday afternoon, neighbours heard a gunshot at his home in
Liverpool.
He was found lying dead in the attic with a gun beside him.
It is understood that Mr O'Brien, who worked for 20 years as an
engineer at Imperial Metals in Kirkby, had bought tickets five weeks in
advance, with the same numbers -- 14, 17, 22, 24, 42 and 47.
His tickets ran out a week earlier on April Fool's Day, denying him a
share of the jackpot.
Mr O'Brien lived with his wife Maureen and teenage son. The couple's
elder son is at sea.
Merseyside Police spokesman confirmed they were investigating the
shooting, but added: ''We are not looking for anyone else in connection
with the man's death.''
Camelot has no plans to change the way advance tickets are sold in the
wake of the shooting. An inquest will open today.
Mr Colin Parry, spokesman for Imperial Metals, said: ''During his time
with the company he proved himself to be hardworking, honest and loyal
to both his workmates and the company.
''Having died in such tragic circumstances this company wishes to
respect the privacy of his family and particularly his wife, Maureen,
and children, in the hope that they can begin to come to terms with this
very sad event.''
As news of the tragedy emerged, punters who did have valid tickets
were celebrating their share of the jackpot.
A family syndicate who scooped nearly #3m revealed how their win had
brought an end to years of bad luck.
Car accident victim Paul Titchmarsh, 27, and his wife Tina, 33, from
Hothfield, near Ashford, Kent, scooped the biggest share of the family
syndicate win, nearly #900,000.
Mr Titchmarsh's mother Alberta, 52, and father Michael, 54, a county
council construction foreman, won #300,000 and plan to buy a bungalow
with the winnings.
Another syndicate winner, Ms Barbara Wicham, 40, is also planning to
move out of her council house and buy another home with her #150,000.
However, syndicate organiser Steve Hudson, 29, took stock of his
fortune before announcing he was off for a job interview this morning as
a retail assistant at a kitchen showroom.
A public-house syndicate was also toasting its #2.7m share of the
jackpot with several celebration drinks.
Thirty-two regulars at the Rifleman's Arms, Glastonbury, Somerset,
will average around #84,000 for each #1 entry.
The winning numbers were picked randomly by student Ian Pitman, 28,
and his friend Dan Brooke, 23, as they drove seven miles from Mr
Pitman's home at Keinton Mandeville to Glastonbury to place the weekly
syndicate investment.
Mr Shaun Renaud, 32, was the third punter to win a share of the
jackpot.
Mr Renaud, from Bracknell, Berkshire, will travel to London today with
his wife Jo, 26, four-year-old son Calum and daughter Shanna, two, to
collect the #2,691,547 cheque.

A HIGHLAND estate regarded as one of Scotland's last great wilderness
areas, that of Knoydart, is likely to be sold following an imminent
take-over of its present owner, the Dundee-based Titaghur jute company.
An investment management group based on the Isle of Man is on the
verge of acquiring a controlling interest in Titaghur, which is in
severe financial difficulties, and it has been advised to dispose of the
company's UK interests.
Titaghur's principal UK asset is the 16,500-acre Knoydart sporting
estate on the peninsula north of Mallaig, which has a resident
population of fewer than 50. It earns a modest income from deer
stalking, boat hire, and hydro-electric power.
It was purchased by Titaghur two years ago for #1.7m but its future
has been in doubt since the company disclosed it lost #345,000 on the
venture last year.
Although registered in Dundee, Titaghur's main operations are in India
where it owns six jute mills in Calcutta with a workforce of 18,000. At
a chaotic annual meeting in Dundee last month, the company reported
debts of #35m and accumulated losses of #67.5m. Its shares, which
reached almost #17 in 1989, are now worth only a few pence.
A source close to the financial reconstruction negotiations told The
Herald yesterday that the investment group seeking to acquire 51% of
Titaghur was unlikely to retain the Knoydart estate.
''It is not regarded as an integral part of what is essentially an
Indian jute company,'' he said. ''The prospective new directors have
been advised to dispose of the estate in a friendly and constructive
manner as soon as possible.''
Mr Peter Addison of English Trust, a merchant bank acting as financial
advisers to Titaghur, confirmed the view that Knoydart ''does not seem
to sit comfortably'' with jute processing in India. ''We do not envisage
it would have a long-term future with the reconstructed company,'' he
said.
The source said an announcement on the take-over of Titaghur was
expected this week but that no firm purchase offers for Knoydart had
emerged so far. However, he said interest in the estate had been shown
by Mr Reg Brealey, the chairman of Titaghur who will be required to step
down by the new regime, and by an English property developer.
They could face competition from some residents of the peninsula who
have been discussing a community buy-out, possibly in association with a
conservation group.
It was Mr Brealey, who is also chairman of Sheffield United Football
Club, who initiated a controversial ''back to basics'' scheme at
Knoydart for deprived youngsters. The project aroused strong opposition
in the remote community -- notably from absentee English property owners
-- which caused it to be shelved after two short courses for a small
number of youths.
However, as The Herald discovered in a visit to Knoydart last week,
not all residents are against the scheme. Mr Mike Reynolds, a retired
Army officer appointed by Titaghur to manage the Highland estate, is
hopeful the new owner would allow the adventure training to go ahead.
''It is a very worthwhile idea, which I believe will benefit both the
young people and the local community.''

<HEADLINE>Court rejects appeal as developers ordered to keep housing work 'within limits' Sheriff hammers noisy building firm</HEADLINE>

A NOTICE ordering a building firm to curb its noise has been upheld in
Dumbarton Sheriff Court in what is thought to be the first legal
judgment of its kind in the UK.
Bearsden and Milngavie District Council ordered Adam (Scotland) Ltd,
of Sandyford Place, Glasgow, to carry out any noisy building work during
restricted daytime hours.
Environmental health officers acted in response to complaints from
residents about heavy machinery being operated early in the morning and
at weekends. The council also carried out its own investigation.
However, the firm failed to comply with the notice -- issued under the
Control of Pollution Act 1974 -- and appealed against the council order.
It is believed to be the first time an appeal against Section 60 has
been launched.
The written judgment of temporary Sheriff Kenneth Mure QC accuses the
builders of being unco-operative and failing to respond to complaints.
The legal dispute concerns a housing development at Henderland Road,
Bearsden. Work started on the 15 houses and two blocks of flats in July
last year.
The sheriff said there had been a large number of reports about
''intrusive'' noise.
Residents in the quiet suburb complained about noise levels,
particularly at weekends. Neighbours said they were forced to turn up
the volume on televisions and speak louder. One said she had to go for a
drive in her car to escape the racket.
Staff at Canniesburn Hospital nearby told Sheriff Mure that terminally
ill and intensive-care patients were also likely to be disturbed by
noisy machinery.
The district council wrote to the developers urging them to control
the noise but the builders failed to do so and a Section 60 order was
issued. It barred Sunday work and limited working hours to 8am-7pm
during the week and 8am-1pm on a Saturday.
The company, under managing director David Nelson, challenged the
order, claiming an upper noise limit should be set and adding that it
would be difficult to organise ''inaudible'' work.
The sheriff said Mr Nelson's arguments were ''strained and contrived''
and the local residents were ''reasonably minded''. He said the locals
had not asked for work to be stopped altogether but merely at certain
times.
The sheriff concluded: ''The notice was, in my view, both reasonable
and necessary.'' He added: ''There had been complaints about noise.
There had been no effort to consult by the builders and, indeed,
evidence of a lack of co-operation by them.''
He said the council had attempted to consider both the builders and
the local residents in framing the notice.
Sheriff Mure added: ''Given that the works will continue for a fairly
lengthy period, it must be highly desirable that the residents in the
locality should have some respite from the effects of noise during the
weekend.''
The assistant chief environmental health officer for Bearsden and
Milngavie, Mr James Reilly, welcomed the sheriff's judgement.
He said it was only the third time the council had issued an order
under Section 60 and the first time one had been challenged in Scotland,
and possibly throughout the UK.
He said: ''It is important that the appeal was rejected because it
backs up our decision to cut down on noise pollution from this
construction site. The sheriff said we had acted in a fair way to both
the builders and local residents. We have set a legal precedent, not
just in Scotland, but possibly in the whole of the UK.''
It is understood that the company, which could not be contacted
yesterday for further comment, may face the bill for court costs. It is
not known if it plans to appeal.

A MISSING schoolboy was found safe and well at a seaside resort
yesterday, police said.
A search was launched after Christopher Fleming, 11, disappeared from
Warrington, Cheshire, last Friday.
A man in his 40s, who was with Christopher in Rhyl, north Wales, was
arrested, a police spokesman added.
Christopher, of Gregory Close, Old Hall, Warrington, was reunited with
his parents, James and Andrea.
Earlier, police said they wished to interview Mr William James Hall,
49. He had been seen with Christopher three or four times before the two
disappeared.
Police would not confirm that Mr Hall had been arrested and was being
interviewed at Warrington Police Station after a 50-mile journey from
Rhyl.
Mr Hall, who is unemployed, had not been seen since Friday afternoon.

A POLICEMAN convicted of punching a teenager who threatened to throw
his baby out of a train has won his appeal.
Constable Richard King said after yesterday's decision at Chelmsford
Crown Court: ''I am greatly relieved.'' He faced disciplinary action on
top of a #150 fine and costs.
Allowing Mr King's appeal, Judge Peter Greenwood said: ''This court is
in no doubt whatsoever that the accused believed reasonably that his
nine-week-old daughter was in danger and he used force which he believed
was reasonable.''
Mr King, 30, a member of the City of London Tactical Firearms Unit and
a former royal bodyguard, had been holding his daughter Jessica on a
train at Southend when he heard Mr David Hobbs, 19, say: ''Let's have
hold of your baby and I'll throw it out of the f. . . . . window.''
The policeman, from South Benfleet, punched Mr Hobbs on the jaw as he
sat with five friends. He then arrested him and ordered him off the
train.
Mr King, whose conviction for assault caused an outcry, said outside
court: ''The public has been absolutely fantastic in their support and I
am so grateful to them.''
His wife, Tina, 31, added: ''We can have our lives to ourselves again
for the first time since this happened 11 months ago. It has been very
traumatic.''
Sergeant Roger Harbige, a Police Federation official, said Mr King had
been facing disciplinary action for having a criminal conviction but the
charge would now be dropped.
''It has been a day of common sense,'' he said.
Mr Hobbs, a car cleaner from Benfleet, told the court he had made the
remark as a joke.
''I thought I said it quietly,'' he said. ''It was a joking remark and
I did not mean it. I said sorry at the time and I still am.''
Outside the court, Mr Hobbs said: ''I did not and would not threaten
to throw a child out of a train window and I still feel that PC King
completely overreacted to the situation, despite the decision of the
court today.''

''TOYBOY'' Philip Roe was jailed for seven years yesterday for the
manslaughter of his five-times married wife.
Roe, a water foreman, smothered his 56-year-old wife Dulcie, who was
15 years older than him, during a drunken row at their caravan near the
end of a three-week leave from his job in Saudi Arabia, Teesside Crown
Court was told.
Violence erupted after Mrs Roe -- said to have drunk most of a large
bottle of Bacardi -- upset her husband by talking about her interest in
young men and taunting him about his sexual inadequacy before further
annoying him by watching a video of her favourite singer Michael Bolton,
it was alleged.
Outside court, close relatives of the victim spoke of their outrage
both at the leniency of the sentence and the way Mrs Roe, a fire station
cook, was portrayed during the hearing as a mini-skirted swinger
obsessed with young men.
Angry sisters of Mrs Roe said her husband, who fled to Bangkok after
the killing, should have been given a life sentence and claimed the
image painted of his victim was totally wrong.
Roe, now 43, and described as of previous good character, originally
was charged with murdering his wife at the caravan in Elton House Park,
Stockton-on-Tees, Cleveland, in May 1993.
However, the prosecution accepted his plea of manslaughter on the
grounds of provocation during a brief hearing last week which was
adjourned.
Roe showed no emotion in the dock yesterday as details of his 18-month
marriage were revealed.
Mr Stephen Williamson, QC, prosecuting, said the couple met at a
singles club while Mr Roe was on leave from his Middle East job. His
previous marriage had broken up.
After Roe became her fifth husband in October 1991, she lived alone
most of the time except when he was home on leave.
However, problems resulted in rows eventually developing and during
their final dispute on the night of May 7, 1993, he killed her.
Next day, he paid #2400 for a first-class flight to Bangkok, where he
remained until he was arrested and then extradited to Britain last year.
It was not until May 14, a week after the killing, that police went to
the caravan after concern about Mrs Roe not being seen. They found her
body in bed and noticed signs of a struggle.
Mr Williamson added that in the caravan Roe had written the word
''sayonara'' -- the Japanese word for goodbye -- but it was also
possibly a play on the other name, Cy, by which he knew his wife.
A post-mortem examination found Mrs Roe had 199 milligrams of alcohol
in 100 millilitres of blood -- about two and a half times the
drink-driving limit -- and it was believed this meant she was less able
to defend herself during the struggle.
After being flown back to Britain under arrest, Roe was interviewed by
police and eventually admitted he had ''just snapped'' and accepted he
''must have smothered her''.
He told police how he loved her but when she had a lot to drink she
said things which annoyed him.
Mr Aidan Marron, QC, defending, said despite Mrs Roe's greater age, it
was her husband who felt insecure in the relationship and she kept
reassuring him in her letters.
Howeer, on the night of the final row she became abusive to a degree
he had not experienced before, with references to toyboys and his sexual
inadequacy.
Sentencing Roe, Mr Justice Butterfield, said: ''You are a man of
hitherto good character, responsible and hard working. The relationship
was, I accept, an intense one and you bore for each other genuine
love.''
However, the intensity of the relationship and age difference had no
doubt ''contributed to the explosion of violence you inflicted on her''.
Outside the court, Mrs Roe's younger sister, Mrs Brenda Briggs, 55,
said: ''He took Dulcie's life and he should have been given life.''

ROCK singer Rod Stewart yesterday stopped off in Glasgow only long
enough to put the boot in to one of Scotland's favourite bands -- and
singe, if not scotch, rumours of his impending retirement.
The London-born born-again Scot kicks off his forthcoming British tour
in Aberdeen, and was asked at yesterday's press conference why he had
chosen Runrig to play the concert.
''I thought we were playing Pittodrie?'' he queried of the
unsurprisingly blonde Californian press agent sitting next to him.
The press corps took some delight in explaining that he was indeed
expected to turn up and perform at the home of Aberdeen FC, but that his
''special guests'' were the well-known Celtic rock combo, Runrig.
''Never heard of them,'' revealed the candid Rod, adding that they
didn't mean much in Los Angeles.
Runrig's manager Marlene Ross later reacted bullishly to the slight,
while admitting that the band is ''not a massive entity in America''.
''Obviously Rod was not party to the information he should have had.
But we are not playing Aberdeen to entertain Rod, but to entertain our
fans,'' she said.
Rod's candour has also precluded him from taking any action against
the reports of his retirement in yesterday morning's tabloid newspapers.
He began by insisting that this would not be his final tour and that he
had been misquoted when he was cornered in Cannes at the weekend.
''I was asked if I was going to retire and I said 'one day, yes' --
they just missed out the 'one day'. But obviously I'm not going to do
this forever.
''I don't know what I'd do if I was not able to make records and
perform -- it would be like cutting off a leg.''
Would he be suing those who said he was hanging up his boots, wondered
a chap from the electronic media? ''I'd had a few bevvies that
afternoon,'' confessed Rod, making us wonder if the tabloids had not
been right all along.
If Stewart, at 50, is really down to his last blonde -- mother-of-two
Rachel Hunter -- and is considering a future as a family man, the two
Scottish performances in June may yet turn out to be his last in his
adopted homeland.
So fans should know that the alleged real purpose behind yesterday's
photo opportunity was to explain a shift of the Glasgow performance, at
Ibrox stadium, by a week from June 3 to June 10. One the following day
at Gateshead also moves back a week, while the Aberdeen show (on June 8)
is an addition to his itinerary.
Rod blamed the progress of work on his new album, No Rest for the
Wicked, and problems over venues.
It did seem odd he should be doing a whistle-stop tour of the venues
trailing rumours of retirement simply to announce a one-week
postponement.
''This was not done as a cheap promotional trick to sell tickets,'' he
insisted, although no-one had suggested it. ''I would lose respect by
retiring and then coming back and then retiring again.''
Tell that to Frank Sinatra, the biggest star to have played Ibrox,
Rod.

A YOUNG man ended up a near vegetable after being attacked by a 6ft
7in drug addict, a court heard yesterday.
Mr Peter Henderson, 23, was in a deep coma for 18 days after the
assault and was not expected to live.
Now, six months after his brutal beating by Darren McCole, 20, his
speech and memory are affected and he is partially paralysed.
McCole was found by police with bloodstained hands and shoes after the
attack, in a boarding house in Mossgreen Street, Kelty, Fife. He was
crazed by drink and drugs, the High Court in Glasgow was told.
Defence advocate Miss Frances McMenamin said McCole had mixed drugs
and Buckfast wine before the assault.
Lord Johnston ordered McCole to be detained for five years in a young
offenders' institution.

THE future of the Channel Tunnel might hang on how well it competes
with the ferry companies this summer, after Eurotunnel co-chairman Sir
Alastair Morton warned that the company was ''at risk'' and that debt
service ''may overcome us''.
There was some panic in the City and the shares tumbled 24p to 218p,
falling to 209p at one point.
Later, Sir Alastair said: ''Our statement today is not some kind of
farewell note. We are not going bust.''
The 31-mile project carries around #8000m of debt and has been harried
by delays throughout its construction. It is only now nearing full
capacity, two years behind schedule.
Last Friday, the company signed an agreement with its 225-strong
banking syndicate for a #300m loan to tide it over until October. It has
to meet the banks in September to bring them up to date on whether it is
meeting the revenue and traffic targets it has set itself.
Sir Alastair was speaking after Eurotunnel confirmed that it had
incurred losses in 1994 of #387m.
It is facing intense competition from the ferry companies which have
sold almost all their capacity for the next three months through
newspaper offers.
However, the survival of the tunnel itself is assured. It is in
no-one's interest to close it after so much has been spent and when it
is seeing revenue rising rapidly at present.
Chief executive Georges Christian Chazot said Eurotunnel's history was
one of a powerful survival instinct, never more evident than when
threatened.
He added that this summer remained the critical test of the ability to
provide a service that would increase Eurotunnel's share of the short
Channel crossing market.
Profitability has been hit by higher than expected interest rates in
the last year in both Britain and France. There have also been delays in
the commissioning and availability of rolling stock.
The target now is to get the operation back on course to reflect the
revenue levels forecast in May last year when Eurotunnel asked
shareholders for #834m through a rights issue.
A new timetable was introduced on April 3 which has considerably
increased capacity of both tourist and freight operations.
Around 174,000 cars were carried in the first three months of this
year and the frequency is doubling to four departures per hour in the
peak summer periods.
The route carried 3371 cars last Saturday and the company is claiming
a 20% market share of the short cross-Channel business and 18% of the
freight activity. In contrast, movements through Dover are beginning to
decline.
However, Eurotunnel is pledged to raise its passenger market share to
40% by the end of this year and to 50% a year later and freight to 30%
and to 40% in 1996.
The Eurostar train service is running six trains a day between London
and Paris and three daily to Brussels. Last weekend, the Paris trains
were virtually full.
Eurotunnel is claiming a total of #2300m from the British and French
railways because of lower than promised train scheduling.
It is also seeking to stop the duty-free concession offered to ferry
customers, which it claims is effectively a subsidy worth #150m a year.

FRESH from its victory in the single tier elections, the Labour Party
in Glasgow has excluded current city council group leader, Councillor
Pat Lally, from its list of people who should assume power in the new
shadow City of Glasgow Council.
It has instead backed a power grouping between former district council
group leader, Councillor Jean McFadden, and current regional council
leader, Councillor Robert Gould.
However, the party's slate has only the status of a recommendation to
be considered by the new council's Labour Group later this week, at
which a faction led by Mr Lally hopes to announce a deal with Mr Gould.
Pivotal to the situation is the long-running and bitter factional
warfare between supporters of Mrs McFadden and Mr Lally.
The party's temporary local government committee, said to be dominated
by McFadden sympathisers, appeared to have opted for an arrangement
whereby Mrs McFadden would be convener of the new council and the ruling
Labour Group, but Mr Gould would be group leader, responsible for
driving policy issues.
According to informed sources, the party's rationale is that it would
be healthier if convenership of the Labour Group and the group
leadership were separated. It is hoped this arrangement would go some
way to defusing the internal arguments which have brought the party into
disrepute in recent times.
However, the Lally camp, who had two observers at last night's party
meeting, is still confident of doing a deal with Mr Gould.
Mr Gould and his regional colleagues would in theory bring 19 votes to
the negotiating table, but it is understood that only twelve of these
are natural Gould supporters. The remainder would possibly be happier in
the more intellectually-based McFadden camp.
Other recommendations from the party include regional councillor
William Harley as deputy convener, and district councillor William
Butler as deputy group leader.
Chief whip would be regional councillor Douglas Hay, with the post of
junior whip going to district councillor Liz Cameron.
All this is bad news for the Lally camp. Although the slate represents
an equitable mixture of regional and district members, all of the
district hopefuls are McFadden supporters.
The Lallyites, who have historically not paid a great deal of heed to
city party activity, seem to have lost out badly both last night and in
the selction of candidates before the election.
One party insider said: ''If you neglect city party politics you lose
control of the process.''
However, it may well be a case of deals real and imagined.
On the face of it, the McFadden faction appear to have triumphed, but
even senior party officials were at a loss to predict the outcome of the
new shadow authority's first Labour Group meeting.
Mr Lally himself had apparently hoped for the straightforward deal
giving himself the Lord Provostship of the new authority (convenership
in the shadow year) and the group leadership to Mr Gould.
Unfortunately, his depute on the district council, Bailie Gordon
Macdiarmid, is insisting on running for the new authority group
leadership himself against Mr Gould. That, it seems, has been the major
stumbling block to a deal being struck between Mr Gould and Mr Lally.
Equally, it appears some of the regional councillors who have been
elected to the new authority are none too happy with Mr Butler as deputy
group leader to Mr Gould.
The situation is extremely fluid. Predicting the outcome could well
mean egg on the face.

MR Jonathan Aitken, putting himself at the head of a crusade to defend
the Government against the ''cancer of bent and twisted journalism'',
yesterday attacked sleaze allegations with the full backing of Mr Major.
The Treasury Chief Secretary summoned the press to dismiss as ''wicked
lies'' allegations concerning his involvement with the Middle East, and
to announce he had launched legal action for defamation against the
Guardian.
He threatened to take similar action against ITV's World in Action if
it broadcast last night's programme -- Jonathan of Arabia -- in which
further allegations are made. Granada, however, went ahead with the
programme, and the Guardian stood by its story.
In the latest Government-approved attack on the media, Mr Aitken
declared ''I have done nothing wrong''. It was time, he said, to strike
back against those journalists bent on destroying ''honourable
institutions and individuals''.
Marking a clear intention on the part of the Cabinet to put an end to
the steady drip of sleaze stories that have so far claimed the careers
of at least 17 members of the Government, Mr Aitken cast himself as a
crusading knight prepared to do battle on Mr Major's behalf.
''If it falls to me to start a fight to cut out the cancer of bent and
twisted journalism in our country with the simple sword of truth and the
trusty shield of British fair play, so be it, I am ready for the fight.
The fight against falsehood and those who peddle it. My fight begins
today,'' he said.
Mr Aitken won immediate support from at least one Tory MP, but Labour
promised to table ''a string of questions'' on the allegations, and the
Liberal Democrats called for his suspension as a Minister.
In his statement Mr Aitken admitted that he had made mistakes in his
career, but said he had been decent and honourable. He was, he added,
prepared ''to defend it not only before the jury of the courts but
before the wider jury of all fair-minded people''.
Evidence of the support Mr Aitken is receiving at the highest levels
of the Government came with the announcement yesterday afternoon that he
would make a statement to the press on the latest allegations against
him.
Instead of having to summon journalists to his front doorstep, Mr
Aitken was accorded all the facilities of the Central Office press
machine.
His wife Lolicia and teenage daughter Veronica sat in the front row.
They smiled throughout as Mr Aitken attacked his critics. Afterwards the
three walked the two hundred yards to Mr Aitken's Georgian townhouse
hand in hand, surrounded by scrambling photographers and cameramen.
In their collaboration yesterday, the Guardian and World in Action
focused on Mr Aitken's relationship with Prince Mohammed bin Fahd, the
son of King Fahd of Saudi Arabia.
They allege that Mr Aitken ''tried to arrange girls for a sheikh and
the prince's entourage'' at the Inglewood Health Hydro in Berkshire, of
which Mr Aitken was a director until 1992. Yesterday's Guardian said a
former matron at the farm, Ms Jo Lambert, had been asked by Mr Aitken if
it was possible to find some girls.
Mr Aitken described the allegation as ''an outrageous falsehood''.
Prince Fahd had never stayed at Inglewood, he said, and had only visited
it once for lunch. ''No girls were present and I made no suggestion that
they should be present or available to him or his friends''.
He added that the matron was dimissed for dishonesty following a
police investigation. ''Criminal charges against the matron and another
person were not pressed following the return of a large quantity of
missing property.''
They also claim that Mr Aitken was on the board of a Lebanese-owned
arms company called Future Management Services and that he failed to
declare the connection in the Commons Register of Members' Interests.
They allege that while he was Minister for Defence Procurement from
1992 to 1994 Mr Aitken maintained relations with the two brothers who
ran the company, Fouad and Ziad Makhzoumi.
Mr Aitken said this was another ''outrageous falsehood''. When he was
approached by the brothers in late 1992 about possible arms sales to
Lebanon, he acted with ''scrupulous propriety'' and handed the matter
over entirely to MoD officials. He had not registered the
non-remunerated directorship because there was no requirement to until
1993.
Mr Aitken also attacked the Guardian's latest instalment in the Ritz
affair. Last year the newspaper claimed Mr Aitken had had his bill for a
stay at the Paris hotel in September 1993 paid for by a business
associate.
''Nothing in the Guardian article this morning shakes my conviction
that my stay in the Ritz Hotel did not breach the rules governing the
conduct of Ministers as laid down in Questions of Procedures for
Ministers,'' he said.
Mr Aitken's action for defamation, which he is paying for himself and
which has the support of the Prime Minister, is against the Guardian,
its editor-in-chief, Mr Peter Preston, and the journalist involved, Mr
David Pallister. Last night the newspaper said it stood by its story.
''The total picture of the Guardian's report is therefore one of
deliberate misrepresentations, falsehoods, and lies, and is clearly part
of the paper's long campaign of sustained attempts to discredit me,'' he
said.
''Here in Britain we have both the best media in the world and the
worst media in the world.''
He added: ''The malignant cells of that bent and twisted journalistic
cancer include those who hold grievances or grudges of their own and are
prepared to give or sell false testimony about others to further their
own bitter agenda.''
Tory MP Alan Duncan, who resigned as a Parliamentary Private Secretary
over a council house purchase, said Mr Aitken was a good and honourable
man. ''I think he has struck a rich vein and good for him for taking a
stand. There is not enough courage around and he has shown he's got
it.''
Labour trade and industry spokesman, Mr Brian Wilson, promised to
table ''a string'' of Commons questions on Mr Aitken's involvement with
Future Management Services, and the extent to which the Department of
Trade and Industry monitored the company's activities.
He said: ''It is increasingly clear that Mr Aitken still has a great
many questions to answer, and every avenue will be used to explore them.
This is after all a Minister who was brought into Government with
responsibility for overseeing the propriety of arms sales.''
The Liberal Democrats called for Mr Aitken's suspension as a Cabinet
Minister pending an independent investigation into the allegations. MP
Alex Carlile said Mr Major had a duty to take action.
''If a police constable was accused of an impropriety he would be
suspended on full pay while the matter was investigated. If an executive
was accused of impropriety he too would be suspended,'' he said.

A DEMONSTRATION was held in a Fife village yesterday after the Saltire
was ordered to be taken down from a school being used as a polling
station, following a complaint to election officials that it could have
political overtones.
The St Andrew Society is to demand an explanation and apology.
About 50 villagers, including pupils and Mrs Liz Mogg, the senior
teacher of Carnock primary village school, held the flag up outside the
polling station in protest yesterday after learning of the decision.
The order to remove the Saltire was taken by Dr John Markland, Fife
region's chief executive and chief returning officer for the area's new
unitary authority, after a complaint by regional council Labour Party
officials.
The school won the Saltire in a competition run by the St Andrew
Society last November. It was raised last Friday, in a specially
arranged ceremony, after planning permission was granted. The national
award was seen as a ''great honour'' for the village, which has a
population of 600, and lies six miles west of Dunfermline.
Mrs Mogg said the pupils and many villagers had worked hard to secure
the award, given in recognition of their efforts in producing an
original Scottish cookery book which had been sold throughout Fife to
mark St Andrew's Day.
She learned that the Saltire had been removed when pupils called at
her home yesterday and asked: ''What's happened to our flag?''
''They were mystified and disappointed,'' the senior teacher said.
The chief executive had argued that the matter was ''trivial,'' and
that the flag would be replaced the following day.
However, Mrs Mogg, who has worked at the school for the past 20 years
and has been senior teacher for the past five years, told Dr Markland:
''The matter is not trivial to me or the people of Carnock.''
Colonel Muriel Gibson, chairman of the St Andrew Society, said she was
''absolutely outraged'' to learn of Dr Markland's decision.
Dr Markland was not available for comment last night. Local Labour
candidate, Mr Alan Kenney, emphasised that he was not behind the
complaint.

THE Transport and General Workers' Union last night rejected Tony
Blair's rewording of Labour's controversial Clause 4 -- and agreed a
snap election for the TGWU general secretaryship.
Labour's largest affiliate is therefore set to vote against the Blair
line at the special Labour Party conference on Clause 4.
0 Assuming that it is not overturned by TGWU delegates to the special
conference on April 29, the decision will mean the union's block vote,
worth 14% of the conference total, being cast for the status quo.
Only if Unison takes a similar decision with regard to its 11% block
vote next week will there be any possibility of the final vote being
anywhere near close.
Yesterday's decision followed discussion over the shock revelation by
general secretary Bill Morris that he was putting himself up for early
re-election.
Last night, there was a feeling that Mr Morris, 57, who by general
consent has not performed well in his first four years, was seeking to
''bounce'' an early election in order to out-manoeuvre any opposition.
