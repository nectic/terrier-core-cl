IN most seaside resorts, a room with a view means a window looking out
to sea. In Troon, the views referred to in estate agents particulars
often mean sight of a golf course, in particular Royal Troon, one of the
hosts to The Open.
The name comes from 'troone', meaning nose, which refers to the craggy
hook of land thrusting into the sea, with a lighthouse on the end.
The town, five miles south of Irvine, was once Ayrshire's third port
and a centre of shipbuilding and ship-breaking. Now it is famous for its
two miles of beaches and five excellent golf courses.
As well as the private clubs of Royal Troon, and Portland, there are
three municipal courses at Fullarton, Lochgreen and Darley. A lot of the
housing in Troon either faces or backs on to a golf course.
As a resort town, Troon has crazy golf, tennis, trampolining, and a
fine concert hall. At the edge of town on the Fullarton Estate there are
walks, picnic areas and splendid spring displays of snowdrops and
daffodils
The Troon Marina is very popular with yachting enthusiasts and
anglers. Sailing is available all year, and there is small dinghy
sailing at Prestwick, which is close by. For the more adventurous
outdoor sports enthusiast there is windsurfing at the South Beach.
You can join a local leisure club at the Marine Highland Hotel, which
has a steam room, sauna, squash courts, swimming pool and games room.
There is an excellent new municipal swimming pool in the town.
For young and old, Troon is easy to get about, being fairly flat, and
there's a good selection of privatelyowned shops to walk to. There are
also thriving community churches, including St Ninians Episcopal with
its oak doors embellished by Robert Thompson with a carved mouse.
While many people choose to retire to Troon, others choose to relocate
in the town because of the schooling. Marr College is a good State
school and there is the choice of private schooling nearby at Belmont
House, Drumlea House and Wellington School.
Glasgow is 40 minutes away by train from Troon Station, and while it
takes a relatively short time to commute to the south of Glasgow by road
- 30 minutes to Newton Mearns - the journey time to the city centre can
be doubled at peak times. Hugh Robertson, Scottish chairman of the
National Association of Estate Agents says: 'The M77 extension will
enhance the property market in Troon, Ayr and Prestwick, as the main
bugbear has been the length of time it takes from Newton Mearns to the
city centre - the same as from Troon to Newton Mearns.'
There is no poor or undesirable area in Troon, having a quiet
small-town atmosphere, and the 'best' area is the Southwoods, with its
large mansions in their own grounds. South Beach, where many properties
have sea views, and Ottoline Drive are also sought-after. Many of the
homes in these areas fetch more than #200,000, and sometimes attract
American buyers.
There is new-build by Wimpey, Lynch and soon Mactaggart and Mickel
about two mile sfrom the town centre. Prices start around #45,000 for a
terraced house..
In the town centre and to the south of the town the properties are
more traditional.
Irene Graham, proprietrix of I D Graham, who has been selling property
in the town for over 25 years, says: 'Troon is always a busy market, and
wasn't badly hit by the recession. Prices are realistic, from #27,000
for a small flat to #500,000 for a large mansion.
'The town attracts people who are retiring, and those who work in
outlying areas. We also have a community of commuters.'
Jane Begg, negotiator at Slater Hogg &amp; Howison, says: 'Troon is a much
more attractive place to raise a family, or retire to, than one of the
more industrial towns nearby, such as Kilwinning, Irvine and Kilmarnock,
and its property costs a little more .'
Maureen Eaglesham, sales negotiator at
J C Roxburgh, says: 'At the moment, the market is very good and there
are no rough areas. Our largest mailing list is for Fullarton Crescent
with properties at #70,000-#100,000.
'We also find that new homes like those by Lynch at Logan Drive on the
Marr Estate sell very quickly at prices from #49,000.
Peter Gillespie, regional manager at SEAL, adds: 'In summing up the
Troon market, the right house, at the right price, in the right
location, will always sell well.'

There is no reason why the Scotland's private rental sector should not
be able to achieve the 25% market share frequently found on the
continent, according to a new group ing of Scottish rental agents. The
recently-formed Scottish arm of the Association of Residential Letting
Agents has set its sights on eroding the dominance of owner occupation
and public rental housing in Scotland.
At its inaugural Scottish meeting in Perth on Monday Robert Jordan,
chairman of ARLA's governing council, said: ''It was obvious that we
needed a council dedicated to the needs of private rentals in the
Scottish housing market.''
The National Council for Scotland has been formed in recognition of
the differences between the English and Scottish Housing Acts of 1988
which govern the private rented sector. The organisation aims to
spearhead the drive against ''cowboy' letting agents and bad landlords,
as well as to stimulate the private rented sector in Scotland.
Currently, private renting only accounts for 6.3% of all Scottish
housing against over 10% in England and Wales and up to 45% in Germany,
France, America and Canada.
''There are substantial differences between the English and Scottish
Housing Acts,'' said Ian Potter, chairman of the new ARLA National
Council for Scotland. ''This requires us to tailor the ARLA training
programmes, the literature and the advice given to members to pass on to
the Scottish public. We are able to draw upon the results of ARLA's
efforts in most aspects of legislation including fire, gas and
electrical safety in privately rented accommodation and their experience
gives us a blueprint for an ethical, professional and self regulating
private rented sector able to protect the public.''
Membership is only open to those agents who have been in the business
for at least two years and abide by a code of practice, including
holding separate client accounts and professional indemnity insurance to
levels that comply with the requirements of the ARLA Fidelity bond.
''These strict requirements and the investigation and interview of all
applicants for membership are the basis for ARLA's success in the rest
of Britain,'' said Ian Potter. ''We want to build on that in Scotland.
These standards, the training for members an d the education of the
public are the big guns in ARLA's drive against unprofessional or
dishonest agents and bad landlords. That is why our priority is to set
the standards for Scotland and get the quality of the Scottish
membership right,'' Richard Burnett, a director of the Property Managers
Association, is the representative for his association on the ARLA
National Council for Scotland. He said: ''ARLA's presence in Scotland
has demonstrated a positive approach to the specialised needs of the
residential lettings market. As our two organisations are working on
parallel tracks, I am sure we will prove to be of mutual benefit

TWENTY-FIVE years have barely left a mark on this spacious, thoroughly
modern villa. Or so it would seem. In fact Brian Collins' home at No.7
Demorville Place, Beith, has changed dramatically, but definitely for
the better.
''With the help of a very good architect, we gutted the house,'' says
Brian. Even the roof was raised to add a large and beautifully fitted
out main bedroom and en-suite bathroom. And after living in the house
for some years, Brian knew exactly what would make it an ideal living
space. Now there is even a shirt cupboard in the bed-room.
''I hate shirts all folded up in a drawer,'' he says, echoing the
feelings of more than a few men who have to push for hanging space in
the wardrobe.
Downstairs, the kitchen has been carefully chosen for convenience and
character. The result is warm and welcoming with a hob set in dark green
tiles. The work surfaces and walls have been treated to the same tiled
finish, while all the cuboards are in a honey-coloured wood that makes a
beautiful combination of timber and ceramic. The microwave, cooker and
fridge freezer are all built in, and over the hob the extractor hood is
hidden beneath an attractive wooden canopy to match the cupboards.
The same wood is used in the double doors that lead onto the garden,
and in fact the warm glow of natural wood greets you almost everywhere
you go.
The house is centrally heated and completely double glazed, while most
of the frames and sills have been left in natural wood finish.
THroughout the ground floor a plain carpet in a pretty shade of blue
has been fitted to add continuity, and the hall wallpaper is a matching
stippled blue. The sitting room has white walls and a wide window that
looks over an apple tree in the front garden.
The living-flame fire has a timbered surround in a rich, warm shade of
pine.
A separate dining room has been created off the hall with a wide
archway giving it an unusually spacious entrance. The walls have been
panelled in natural timber as a change from paper.
Two double sized bedrooms are tucked away at the back of the house,
ideal for giving teenage kids their own space according to Brian.
''Go for it'' must have been the principle guiding the decoration in
the bathroom. An uncompromising partnership of black tiles and carpet
with a white bathroom suite has given the room a really glamorous look.
The separate shower cubicle with its smoked glass door and the gold taps
add a luxurious finish. But, as Brian, says nothing but gold would look
right in such surroundings.
Up the open pine stairs the main bedroom boasts that shirt cupboard as
well as a huge fitted double wardrobe with sliding glass doors. The
walls have been given a rich terracotta, stippled paper with a slight
sheen, which perfectly matches the plain peach carpet. The room has its
own en-suite bathroom with pine timbered walls and a champagne suite.
Next door is the fourth bedroom, which has its own large built-in
wardrobe like the other rooms, and space for a double bed.
There is an integral garage to the side of the house and a porch with
room for a couple of sun chairs. During the day the rear garden is a sun
trap but in the evening the sun has moved round, making the porch a
pleasant place to catch the last of it.
Situated in a quiet cul-de-sac on the edge of Beith, the view across
the nearby fields is uninterrupted. In the distance, the sleeping
warrior on Arran is clearly visible. He's a sight for which it's well
worth raising the roof.

A SPECIALIST builder is offering the chance for a purchaser to design
his or her own internal room lay out.
Span Homes, the individual housebuilding division within Span
Construction Group, is marketing the last remaining greenfield site to
be developed in the heart of Aberdeen's Ferryhill area.
Located on a 0.2-acre site, the house will be built to an individual
design and the interior will be specifically designed to meet the
customers requirements.
Span Homes' operations and sales manager, Eddie McInnes, said:
''Although the style and exterior design of the house has already been
determined to comply with planning requirements within the area, the
customer will have considerable scope in deciding up on the interior
plan and design throughout.'' A price of around #185,000 has been set
for both site and house.
Elsewhere, Span Homes currently have two other similar developments in
Newburgh, near Ellon, which are expected to become available in spring
1995.

THE Grampian town of Inverurie is one Scotland's fastest-growing
communities, with demand driven by the North Sea oil industry centred in
nearby Aberdeen.
Barratt Construction is about to start work on a #4.95m housing
contract in Inverurie on behalf of developers R B Farquhar Ltd. The site
for the development was formerly used for industrial premises. It is
bounded by the old Aberdeen-to-Inverurie canal, which gave rise to the
area's name of Port Elphinstone.
Demand has consistently outstripped supply of housing within Gordon
District and has resulted in rapid increases in house prices to levels
beyond the means of local people with moderate incomes.
The new 113 houses project will go some way to redress the balance. In
partnership with Gordon District Council and Scottish Homes, the
national housing agency, R B Farquhar will provide 51 new homes for sale
to purchasers prioritised and grant-aided by the District Council.
The balance of 62 new homes will be grant aided by Scottish Homes
through housing association who will offer affordable rent or shared
ownership options to council nominees.
There will also be landscaped canal and riverside walks to provide an
attractive leisure resource

A MENU of home-buying incentives has been cooked up Lynch Homes,
Ayrshire's largest private homebuilder. Sales manager Al Linden said:
''We realised that the majority of our competitors were simply offering
a single-dimensional proposition -- full carpeting, or mortgage subsidy,
or assistance with legal fees. We felt that the choices available were
too narrow and that we could do something different.''
Called First Gold, Extra Gold and Solid Gold, the Lynch Homes package
offers an array of incentives designed to address each buyers individual
requirements and provide assistance to make a home-move as painless as
possible.
The company is building in Ayr, Troon, Loans, Coylton, Mauchline,
Paisley, and East Kilbride. Prices start at #48,995.

Brian Wilson MP is absolutely correct in demanding an inquiry into the
damage sustained to Millport pier. His call for expert advice is also
correct, especially on the aspect of the decking being bolted to the
framework of the pier, which can clearly be seen in your photographs
(January 18). He is seeking to safeguard the proper use of public funds.
I can recollect an autumn storm more than 30 years ago, when the pier
was submerged, the turnstiles and George Hotel were awash, and the water
flowed through and entered the small harbour from the top. On this
occasion the pier was also affected. The decking disappeared completely,
but the framework remained intact.
Since the planks were laid only in recesses, they simply floated away,
but thanks to local knowledge all but a few were recovered from various
spots round the island, the bulk of which ended up in Balloch Bay.
Reinstatement was only a life-size jigsaw.
It is obvious that the engineers of old knew a thing or two and had
listened to local knowledge (unlike the present redesign of the harbour
at Port William) and the inquiry ought to bear this in mind.

In your article on Scotland's Business (Is Scotland's new tourist
identity a turn-off? -- January 26), Tony Gerlings comments that: ''The
(Scottish) tourist board's big failure is . . . that it doesn't provide
basic amenities such as guidebooks and information in other languages.
That discourages Europeans from trading with Scotland.''
It is unfortunate that the Scottish Tourist Board operates under
constraints which may not allow for the production of foreign language
brochures -- but from your article there is a danger that readers assume
that no foreign language brochures are available whatsoever.
In Shetland we place considerable emphasis on marketing in Europe,
since Europe historically accounts for some 40% of our visitor numbers,
and our brochure, Shetland -- The Natural Choice, is available in eight
languages -- Norwegian, Swedish, Danish, German, French, Italian, Dutch,
and British.
Bear in mind, too, that Shetland lies as close to Bergen in Norway as
it does to Aberdeen, so Northern Europe, and particularly Scandinavia,
is a crucial market-place for us.
With the slender resources which we have available we are working hard
to capture a greater share of the European market, and I believe that
what we are doing dovetails with the broader initiatives of the STB.

I would like to express my deep concern over the proposed closure of
wards 7 and 8 at Cowglen Hospital in Glasgow. These form a special unit
for young long-term patients -- multiple sclerosis, progressive
illnesses, severe accident injury, coma patients, etc, and the
professional care and nursing they receive there is of the highest
standard.
Where there are relatives they too receive much support and
encouragement in dealing with the trauma and sense of loss caused by
serious accident or illness of a loved one.
Now this unit is threatened with closure because ''community care'' is
cheaper. None of the decision-makers visited the unit to see the special
care these patients receive, or to ask the patients themselves about
their anxieties and concerns for the future.
I would like to ask the Greater Glasgow Health Board not to close this
place where love, joy, and medical care unite to give comfort and hope
to people whose needs are so great.

I have been reading with interest lately that Scottish Power are
wanting to build pylons across south Ayrshire and to build an
interconnector between Scotland and Northern Ireland.
One can only hope that they can build it better than the electricity
that is fed into Milton of Campsie.
I have lived here for two years now and have never experienced so many
power failures in the other 44 years of my life. The last power failure
lasted six hours on January 21 and we still have the rest of the winter
months to contend with.
It must be at least 12 times in the past two years if not more, and
there is no room for complaint from Scottish Power; this is, after all,
1995, and if they can find the money to build this new project, then
Scottish Power can find it to renew the machinery that feeds Milton of
Campsie.

While in sympathy with Ms Roff's exposure of proposed radiation
experiments in the United States in the 1950s which most of us would
consider highly unethical (January 24), I feel it is necessary to point
out that the accompanying picture with its byline about Dr Pirie is
misleading.
The illustration shows a Coolidge tube used to produce X-rays in the
early 1900s, currently part of the exhibition from the Medical History
Museum at Ninewells Hospital, to commemorate the 200 years since the
laying of the foundation stone of Dundee Royal Infirmary.
Rontgen discovered X-rays at the end of 1895 and many of the early
pioneers in the application of X-rays in clinical medicine developed
tumours on their hands because in these early years the doctors used to
hold their own hands in the path of the X-rays in front of a fluoroscope
screen, in order to test if the image was clear enough. It was years
before the danger of this procedure was recognised.
The tumours which formed were specific to X-ray exposure and are
rarely seen nowadays. The radiation from radioactive compounds,
including radium, is different in character from X-rays. It is not
helpful to equate X-rays, which are artificially produced by sending a
stream of electrons through an evacuated tube on to a target, with the
natural radioactivity emanating from radioactive elements decaying to a
more stable isotope.
It was due to the practice of the early X-ray pioneers, like Dr George
Pirie of Dundee and Dr John McIntyre of Glasgow, that the danger of
long-term exposure to X-rays was recognised many decades before the
recognition of the dangers of radium and radioactive fallout.
In this centenary year, it is worth remembering that as early as 1936
a memorial was built in Hamburg to the early X-ray pioneers who suffered
injury during their work. Of the original 169 names from 15 nations, 11
were from Britain, seven including Dr Pirie from Scotland. The citation
reads: ''They were heroic pioneers for a safe and successful application
of X-rays to medicine. The fame of their deeds is immortal''.

Like your diarist, the members, service users, and staff of the
National Schizophrenia Fellowship (Scotland) are not devoid of a sense
of humour. We also agree with his point that schizophrenia is not a
laughing matter (January 18).
People affected by schizophrenia have enough to contend with without
also having to be the butt of cheap -- and ill-informed -- jokes. It was
therefore all the more disappointing to come across just such
ill-informed comments ''inspired'' by our job advertisement in The
Herald on January 13.
Attitudes like these serve only to compound the difficulties faced by
people with schizophrenia and those around them. If any of your readers
-- or, indeed, Ken Smith -- would care to contact our headquarters they
can be assured of accurate information about the nature of this serious
and sometimes devastating mental illness, its effects, and the effects
of ignorance and prejudice on individuals seeking to overcome their
illness.

I read with interest Brian Smith's letter on the pleasures of the West
Highland Line (January 17). I agree with some of the points he raised,
in particular about the growth of trees and vegetation in a great many
sections of the line which completely spoil the view.
I do not know who owns the trees, but I am aware that there are a
great many rules and regulations which make felling difficult. It would
be a long and costly exercise, and no job for community workers, as he
suggests.
If the route is advertised as one of the top scenic routes in Scotland
something will require to be done in some of the worst parts quickly
before a case is made out for wrongful description. No-one wants a four
or five-hour journey, which is full of anticipation, to be endured like
an extension to the Queen Street tunnel, and it could come to that.
The weather is another factor which is beyond control, especially the
low cloud and mist prevalent in that part of Scotland.
There are some very big problems ahead for any owner of the line, not
only financial.

The Readers Digest Touring Guide to Britain is currently being
promoted by mail-shots, prize draws, etc. When I received my copy on one
week's approval I naturally turned to the two-page entry on Glasgow. I
was dismayed and amazed to find that The Burrell Collection and Pollok
House have been omitted from the places of interest worth visiting.
Of lesser importance perhaps is that the item on The Hunterian Art
Gallery contains no reference to the Whistlers. They cannot be included,
surely, among either ''Scottish Artists'' or ''Old Masters''!
I am informed by the Glasgow Tourist Board that there are around half
a million visitors to the Burrell every year. If other locations in the
British Isles are treated in similar fashion the Guide is obviously
unreliable and not worth purchasing. As for Glasgow, the city has been
sold short and some acknowledgement and apology is due from the
publishers.

IT remains one of life's mysteries that the words Britain By Train
have never truly roused commuters to platform rebellion. Maybe we should
blame outrage fatigue but somehow, when confronted by the shambles of
British Rail, a sort of comatose condition settles on disgruntled
travellers. Instead of any rampant pugnacity, we sleepwalk through the
chaos, and choose to call it stoicism.
But if ever a day had been right for revolt it was last Friday when at
Liverpool Lime Street snow elsewhere threw everything already in the
station off track. Those of us gathered for the 14.22 to Newcastle were
in a bit of a sulk anyway, the distance between the cities being
scarcely 190 miles yet this train, the best direct link of the day,
contriving to stretch that journey to four hours. Four hours, that is,
with the wind in the right direction and no leaves clogging the
arteries.
Even before our expedition began there were intimations of delay.
Blizzard conditions had upset the inner workings of the indicator board,
sending notices of departure times haywire. It also soon became useless
to badger the rail staff for information as a jammed valve in the horn
of a stationary train was now fracturing all available air space in the
concourse. For almost 45 minutes its blaring High C solo silenced
conversations, scared infants and pensioners, and muted the show-off
rantings of those who wear mobile phones as ear accessories.
Anxious to make the best of it we sought out our location's finer
points only to discover that poor old Lime Street -- a name which has
travelled the world -- must always have a wintry aspect because it has
been largely by-passed in the grand scheme to transform major rail
centres into bijou emporia. No Tie Rack here, no Sock Shop, no dried
flower barrows, delis, or continental coffee shops. And if Lime Street
has Super Loos, or that disconcertingly named facility, the Baby
Changing Room, then it keeps them pristine by ensuring they stay
entirely out of sight.
On this concourse there did not seem to be a single litter bin. As a
result empty burger boxes, Coke cans, and pizza trays were left stacked
on metal chairs, as if the detritus of consumerism now merits the same
comfort as customers themselves.
The demon meddling up our schedule was an electrical failure in an
oncoming train now blocking access to the station for several others.
One hour late by now, and with that horn solo continuing its punishment,
we would have climbed aboard any vehicle that moved -- a luggage trolley
had one been handy -- in order to escape. But no-one stormed off to see
the station manager; no-one let fly at a passing guard. The passivity of
non-persons had descended on us. Better to induce a carbohydrate coma
with one more doughnut than gird up the persecution baggage and
complain.
After a further half hour we were on our way although the weather was
worsening and noise still proved the fiercer enemy. Is there anything
that sets fellow passengers' teeth on edge as much as the high-spirits
of a school outing on its journey home? We had hardly left Lime Street
when worldly teenage girls began baiting the male students in their
class. With a shrieking repertoire of silly lewdness, they subjected the
mortified lads to the kind of anatomical scrutiny still practised by
leery judges at beauty competitions. Here, indeed, was She-Devil
revenge.
At Stalybridge the party exited but before that three passengers had
moved further down the Sprinter because the bedlam was now threatening
them with migraines. Through it all a wan smile had played about the
features of the pupils' teacher. She had the settled, miserable fatigue
of someone who long ago abandoned hope of discipline, and now seemed on
the verge of giving up the domini's ghost altogether. ''Matthew's
missing,'' observed one of the girls as they disembarked. ''Matthew's
always missing,'' replied the school mistress, unimpressed by the dodges
of an accomplished truant.
By six o'clock it was clear we would not reach Newcastle until 8pm. A
man, driven close to famine by that thought, decided to change his
destination and jump the rods at York. That way, he said, he could treat
himself to toasted tea cakes in a celebrated cafe called Betty's. Many
of us might well have done the same if loyal people had not been waiting
at the other end, for by now the refreshments trolley carried all the
appeal of jailhouse catering. ''Why is there no proper buffet car on a
journey that lasts a minimum of four hours?'' moaned one traveller to
her companion. ''Because we live in the undeserving sticks and are
saddled with a Sprinter,'' came the reply. ''On this route they should
give us an InterCity, with first class for those who want it. But that's
considered too sophisticated for the provinces.''.
''People's Charter, it's a load of codswallop,'' another woman
intoned. ''If I get off at Durham a return ticket from Liverpool costs
me #41. If I stay on to Newcastle, the price rises to #64. Where's the
fairness in that?'' Yet as we wheezed and lurched through the falling
snow, these splutterings of rebellion came to nothing.
In one carriage the irritation voiced about the Sprinter's broken
cardphone had subsided into community singing. So, we arrived at
Newcastle, waving not rioting, stepping down into a station which again
had received only the minimum of refurbished promise. But at least we
were on foot now, marching under the  Way Out arrows which pointed us
far from dismal rail tracks, and up and onward into Heaven.

DEVOLUTION or independence. A slice of bread or a loaf. One slogan as
good as another. The shame about the current debate, if it can be
dignified by that name, within the Scottish National Party is that it is
fought on the ground of high principle but is better suited to a low and
distinctly muddy swamp. The target of much of the invective is party
leader Alex Salmond who talked to a Scottish Sunday newspaper on the
subject of party policy on devolution. Mr Salmond was clear on this
policy, as indeed he should be because it was adopted at the same party
conference which elected him leader. In essence it states that the SNP
is against devolution, but that if a devolved parliament is established
the SNP would campaign to gain seats within that parliament on the
platform of independence. It would continue to press for full
independence as a basic and central plank of policy. Unfortunately for
Mr Salmond there are a number of SNP activists who do not know their own
party policy or, more likely, who do not wish to acknowledge those
aspects of policy with which they disagree. The fact that the Sunday
newspaper in question appeared to believe that it was reporting a shift
in SNP policy, from pure independence to devolution, confused matters
more than a little. Hence we have the great SNP debate on devolution, a
bogus and quacking affair if ever there was one.
The charge (for certain activists are fond of such language) was led
by Mr Jim Sillars, a card-carrying SNP member but no longer an official
executive of the party. Mr Sillars is careful at the outset to quote the
original article, though he draws the quite unsubstantiated inference
from it that Mr Salmond has somehow set Labour free by implying that the
SNP had surrendered on the issue of independence. Mr Sillars then threw
caution to the winds by referring to ''. . . the new Salmond policy''
which, as we have already described and as he already knows, is neither
Salmond's policy nor new. The rest of his views on the issue constitute
little more than low invective, although Mr Salmond displays his own
lapse of taste in his description of Mr Iain Lawson, whose views on the
matter can be found on our Perspective page, as a cross which must be
borne.
Mr Lawson's interpretation is interesting, if predictably
anti-Salmond. He appears convinced that a shift in policy has taken
place, but more important than this is the way in which he attempts to
place a wedge between the party in the North-east, characterised as
rural softies, and the party in the hard-nosed, realistic central belt.
To take this view of matters is to opt for the purest, head-banging
silliness. On this way of thinking it is a worthwhile exercise to
attempt to split the party on an issue of accepted policy, not just on
policy lines but on geographical lines as well. For his part Mr Salmond
remains suspiciously calm over the whole affair. He can hardly be happy
at being misrepresented but he has the solid foundation of party policy
on which to recline. More probably he has another agenda. It is always
helpful to have those who oppose you display utter determination to make
fools of themselves; no doubt he will take advantage of this.

THE political future of Yitzhak Rabin, Prime Minister of Israel, is of
secondary importance to the success of the Middle East peace process.
Unfortunately, Mr Rabin and the current and faltering momentum towards
peace are inextricably linked. The simplistic analysis is to say that
the growing opposition to the various accords within Israeli public
opinion, and the parallel resistance to Mr Rabin and his views, is
largely because of the activities of the fundamentalist bombers who have
inflicted their amoral politics on Israeli society in recent weeks. The
suicide bombing last week which killed 21 Israelis at a bus stop for
young soldiers seems to have been something of a watershed in this
process. Most of those who died were killed as they ran to give aid to
those caught in the first blast, but the horror quotient of the outrage
is not really the point. In a nation accustomed to feeling and
expressing deep anger, the bus stop bombs have gone deeper. The latest
polls show that at least half of Israelis consulted are now against any
further continuation of talks with the Palestine Liberation
Organisation. Even President Ezer Weizman, who is by no means a hawk on
this issue, has agreed with the calls to halt negotiations.
Mr Rabin's response to this growing public disquiet has been to
insist, correctly, that there are no magic solutions to terrorism and no
such thing as 100% security. Summoning up the considerable reserve of
rumbling gravitas, which is his substitute for an almost complete lack
of political or personal charisma, Mr Rabin argues that to delay or
disconnect the peace process would be to give in to the bombers, to let
them know that they can bomb peace from the Middle East agenda. Again he
is right. To halt the process would be to let the bombers know that they
had won. Worse, it would spur them to further efforts. Yet this is not a
comfortable message, and it is one which can be delivered successfully
only by a leader who has the widespread trust of his people and who
conveys the impression that he is in control. Mr Rabin has none of this.
In the past few days he has swithered hopelessly on the domestic issue
of tax on stock profits, reversing a firm decision to introduce the
measure, then blaming his Finance Minister for the mess. Mr Rabin is
seen, then, as irresolute, prone to shifts of opinion, and general
instability. Unfortunately, this merely reinforces old rumours about his
steadiness and reliability in a crisis which have dogged him since his
days as a respected, but latterly unconvincing, military general. The
key problem in all this is that if Rabin loses power to the right-wing
Likud coalition the entire peace process will be suspended and the PLO
will be left hanging on a wire, prone to easy pot-shots from the
fundamentalists. Rabin, in short, must survive for the good of the peace
process. Whether his latest subtle hints on the adoption of separation
from Palestinians, as opposed to the economic interdependence envisaged
in the accords, will succeed in restoring his position must be open to
the gravest doubt.

THE International Football Board, which consists of the four home
countries and FIFA, will meet at Turnberry next month, and among the
issues to be discussed is a move to make the most radical changes in the
history of the game.
Time-outs, 11 substitutes, four of whom can be used, and dug-out
changes are being proposed, and while there was a quick reaction from
Scottish authorities, booting out the changes last night, Brazil, the
home of the world champions, already have the new set-up in place.
The alterations in Brazil, which also is the home of FIFA president
Joao Havalange, were introduced last weekend and could have
far-reaching, world-wide consequences. The world's ruling body have
approved changes in the fast recovering domestic game in Brazil, with
basketball-type time-outs introduced and the traditional dug-out made
redundant.
And coaches now are able to strip a complete team of substitutes, with
four of the 11 players available to be introduced in the match, as part
of the most innovative package ever approved.
The first programme of the league season was played on Sunday, when
the changes were given a positive welcome in a country where the sport
is making a dramatic comeback.
Reaction to the proposed changes was immediate as well as passionate
among the Scottish football hierarchy. It was as if the Monday Club was
asked to approve Tony Benn as president elect.
Talking about the board meeting in Turnberry next month when the
changes are to be discussed, Jim Farry, the SFA chief executive, said:
''You can be sure it is already a raging certainty they will be opposed
by Scotland. We will not be following the boys from Brazil.''
Farry went on to demonstrate why the alterations would meet with a
great deal of opposition in European circles, and especially in the UK.
''You have to remember that Brazilian football has gone to pigs and
whistles, with cameramen on the park during the game, allegations of
corruption, and reports that presidents of clubs have been threatening
each other with guns.''
This may be true, of course, but we are only talking about time-outs
here and they do not exactly represent the advent of Armageddon.
However, as Farry pointed out, the radical changes in Brazil would
need major support from Britain if they were to be adopted in the world
in general. The kind of changes sanctioned in South America would not be
allowed in Europe, for instance, without the approval of the
International Football Board, which consists of the four home countries
in Britain, who each have a vote, and FIFA, which has four votes.
It looks equally sure that England, Wales, and Ireland will vote
against, and that would be enough to veto any chance of the Brazil
revolutions taking place here.
However, the influence of Havalange can never be minimised, and the
fact that the country where the world champions come from is willing to
go for change ought not to be dismissed.
None the less, like Farry, Scottish League secretary Peter Donald is
puzzled that the changes have been allowed in Brazil. ''It seems they
are outwith the laws of the game as they stand, and could be approved
only by the international board, although perhaps FIFA have given
special dispensation.''
For the last two decades Brazilian football has been in decline with
high inflation cutting attendances, and the many stars that represented
the country in successive World Cup finals, departing for Europe.
But that trend now has been reversed, and with this change in pattern
has come a new live television deal and an upsurge in attendances.
''We have to be aware of upgrading the game in such a competitive
world, and this package of new ideas was welcomed by coaches, players,
and the public,'' said a Brazilian spokesman.
The time-out is the most far-reaching innovation, for it will allow
coaches the opportunity to change the course of the match at an
intermediate stage, prior to the half-time.
In the five-minute period following the twentieth minute of the game,
either coach can call for a time-out period lasting up to three minutes,
in order to reorganise his team.
The thought of Walter Smith calling a halt to an Old Firm match with
Celtic a goal ahead and pressing, and the subsequent reaction of the
fans, is mind-boggling.
The team of substitutes was not used extensively in the opening
matches but observers believe that, as the season moves into a more
critical period, the option will be more popular.
FIFA agreed with the Brazilian proposal that the dug-out is oppressive
and pressure building for coaches so a wider, deeper area from where
they can observe the match has replaced them.
The trackside zone can take the coach closer to the touchline and
their players, and the hope is that this new freedom will defuse tension
and limit the number of explosive dug-out incidents of recent years.
But the ruling body red-carded perhaps the most interesting of this
batch of changes. For the Brazilians wanted to introduce a blue card to
the barrage of colour which brightens the modern game.
This would be used when a player had incurred two yellow cards for
more innocuous offences, such as dissent. The punishment would still be
dismissal, but the offending player could be substituted, leaving the
team, and the game unblemished.
That suggestion was vetoed, but there is a feeling that its
introduction will be persisted with for although unwilling in the short
term, FIFA are responsive to radical change.
This season in Brazil will be closely monitored and if successful, the
Havalange influence on the world game will surely see pressure for the
measures to be repeated further afield.

SUCH a cliche, this concept of the House of Lords being full of old
buffers who don't know whether it's Wednesday or Westminster. The upper
house is nothing like that. Well, maybe just a wee bit.
The Scottish Sports Council recently organised a lunch at Westminster
for the Scottish all-party parliamentary group on sport.
While the rest of the group turned up for the lunch at the Commons,
Lord Haddington (educated at Ampleforth, family seat, Mellerstain, near
Kelso), reported to the Scottish Sports Council's offices at The Gyle,
Edinburgh.
He arrived clutching a suitcase and signed the visitors' book. But
lunch there was none. For his lordship's information, Parliament is that
big building beside the Thames, quite handy for Westminster tube
station.
* And who says their lordships are not interested in the big issues
which affect everyday life in Scotland.
Take the iniquitous threat to our Highland rail services.
Lord Rankeillour has tabled a written question protesting at the plan
to axe the sleeper service from London to Fort William. Rankeillour
lives on an estate near Spean Bridge where he doubtless pursues his
stated hobbies of shooting, architecture, grand-scale landscaping, and
inventing agricultural equipment.
He should know the value of the Fort William-to-London sleeper better
than most. As one of our unelected peers, he qualifies for a free #266
hurl on it whenever he wants to go to London.
Own goal
THE first edition of a new monthly football video features Eric ''Ooh!
Ah!'' Cantona on the cover. Presumably it is destined for the same shelf
as other nasties. The series of videos is titled Net Busters. At least
they got the busters bit right.
Onward Christie
AS Clause 4 is about to become as distant a memory as Keir Hardie's
bunnet, we note the title of a speech to be made later this year by
Campbell Christie.
The general secretary of the Scottish TUC will give a Town and Gown
address at Strathclyde University on Trade Unions and the Challenge of
the New Human Resources Management Environment.
No doubt there will be storming of the capitalist battlements, after
the wine and canapes.
Cub reporter
FURTHER to our mention of scouting in a recent Diary, a memory has
flooded in from Jim Nicol of Lenzie. He recalls the night his young
brother attended his first night at the Cubs.
The khaki chap in charge asked of his new charges gathered round the
60-watt coloured bulb campfire: ''Does anyone know the name of the
person who founded the Scouting movement?''
''Buffalo Bill,'' confidently replies Nicol Minor.
Go Westwood
PRINCE Charles's Scottish Youth Business Trust is looking for likely
young entrepreneurs to benefit from their grants and other financial
support mechanisms.
The trust is advertising for people to ''be the next Vivienne
Westwood''.
Westwood is the punk fashion designer who turned up to meet the Queen,
sans knickers, and went on to portray Her Majesty on a Sex Pistols
T-shirt with a safety pin through her nose. Mummy will be pleased with
the kind of company Charles is keeping.
Swear by it
SEE the information you readers send in for further dissemination?
Like the parish bulletin of St Gabriel's church in Merrylee Road,
Glasgow.
The bulletin contained an item thanking parishioners for making
donations to an organisation called Play In School Hospitals. It then
informed the readers that ''P*** is now in the happy position of being
funded . . .'' The asterisks in the acronym are ours. It may be OK for a
parish magazine to be so blunt but it would never do in a family
newspaper.
Kicked into touch
FOR years we knew legendary rugby Lion Gordon Brown as Broon frae
Troon. Then, when he got his vowels done to become an ITV commentator,
we looked up to him as Brown from Trown. Now, the latest advertising
campaign by Irvine new town development corporation claims Gordon as one
of their own. He was born there and grew so big because of the sea air,
they say. All very well, but Broon frae Irvine does not exactly trip off
the tongue.
Low-tech
AN anguished phone call from reader Fiona Raitt of Eaglesham. Could we
please explain something technological to her mother. One of mum's
Christmas presents was a music centre (as apparently radiograms are now
called) with a CD player. And a few of her favourite tunes are on CD
records.
She is fair enjoying the quality of the sound but is complaining that,
for the life of her, she can't get any music from the flipside of the
CDs. All we can think is that she is using the wrong kind of needle.

RUGBY League's top Scot has quit the international scene -- because he
cannot stomach the prospect of playing for England. Leeds player Alan
Tait made the decision after pulling out of the squad to face Wales in
Cardiff tonight.
He said: ''I am qualified to play for England because I started my
Rugby League career here after moving from Kelso. But now I realise that
I just couldn't live with myself if I played any form of rugby in an
England jersey.''
Tait added: ''The highlight of my career was pulling on my Scotland
gear and running out on to Murrayfield. To wear an England rig-out might
take the shine off that memory.''
He won eight caps at centre for Scotland after making his debut
against France in the 1987 World Cup in New Zealand. He moved south to
Widnes after having helped Kelso to clinch the first division title in
1988.
Tait hit hit back at his critics at the time by saying: ''I'm good at
rugby and I want paid for it.''
After switching to full back, he won 18 Great Britain caps -- but the
prospect of an England one was obviously too hard to bear. ''I was
picked for them once before, but I had to withdraw after picking up an
injury,'' he said.
''This time I was told I was definitely going to play against Wales,
and that's when it really hit home hard. I just couldn't go through with
it.
''I've written to the Rugby League to tell them I am opting out
totally at international level. I'll be 31 soon and I've told them they
should start planning for the future.''
Tait made it clear that he would love to return north of the Border --
on a paid basis.
''Rugby League has only just been established in Scotland and a
fledgling international team has been formed,'' he said. ''I'd be
honoured to represent them.''
* TWO Scots on the fringe of this season's international team have
signed provisional registration forms for West Hartlepool for next
season.
Shade Munro, of GHK, who was capped against all the Five Nations'
Championship countries last season, and also played in the two
internationals against Argentina, could join fellow Scottish
internationalists Rob Wainwright and Derrick Patterson at the County
Durham club.
Rowen Shepherd, who has played at full back, centre and stand-off for
Edinburgh Academicals, could be used by the English club at full back,
Shepherd's preferred position, as they may lose their present incumbent,
Tim Stimson, to Leicester.

ALVIN Martin's controversial sending-off against Sheffield Wednesday
last week has been overturned.
The threat of a three-match ban was yesterday removed from West Ham's
former England defender, who collected the fourth red card of his career
for a ninth-minute challenge on Wednesday striker Mark Bright.
Leicester referee Paul Danson decided he had mistakenly brought out
the red card when Martin tumbled, bringing down Bright near the half-way
line in a match they eventually lost 2-0.
The sending-off has been replaced by a caution for ungentlemanly
conduct.

TO dare to suggest one is even less than wildly enthusiastic about
rugby in general, and Scottish rugby in particular, embracing the creed
of professionalism is to be regarded like the chap who inherited a title
on the eve of the French Revolution. ''Have you lost your head?''
demanded his lady wife upon hearing the news.
Paying players, paying everybody it would appear, will be good for the
game, will have enormous advantages and bring instant happiness to all
concerned.
Only, I do not believe a word of that.
I have peered into the future outlined by Mr Eddie Tonks, chairman of
the New Zealand Rugby Football Union, and I am not much inspired by it.
He favours professionalism along the lines of NZ cricket, where players
are on performance-based contracts with a sliding scale of retainers
based on their Test experience and status.
As my friend Mr Sean Lineen, himself from Tonks' country, rather wryly
put it: ''This has not exactly done wonders for New Zealand cricket.''
And he, still one of the finest centres in the Scottish game, accepts
the principle of payments.
So, at the highest level of rugby, do I. For at least a decade I have
been arguing that internationalists, upon winning each and every cap,
should have their trust funds boosted by, say, #1000. Gavin and Scott
Hastings would be walking away with #100k -- and good luck to them, they
deserve every penny.
But I fail to see the advantage, or even the practicality, of
attempting to professionalise rugby below this level.
Performance-related pay? Does that apply to the team or to the
individual? If it is the latter I would be rather inclined to go for the
line myself than pass to my winger, wouldn't you? A sliding scale of
retainer would be something Mr Jim McLean might be able to advise us
about!
Mr Tonks and his committee are fearful because they have lost a number
of All Blacks to rugby league. You may have spotted one of them, Va'aiga
Tuigamala, scoring a brace of tries for Wigan on Saturday. New Zealand's
claim to him as one of their own is somewhat tenuous as he is Western
Samoan, but let that pass.
Wales have lost just as many to the other code and are not suggesting
everyone hands in their amateur certificates.
Scotland, in recent memory, have seen two players of any note, Ally
Tait and George Graham, disappear down this route, hardly a cause for
national mourning. Scores more, including Andy Irvine, John Rutherford
and Gary Armstrong, have looked at professional offers and said ''no
thanks.''
But if we don't pay we will, it is alleged, lose all our players to
English clubs who are already doing so. Maybe. Scots have been heading
south for greater glory since James V1 swopped crowns, but it has not
halted sport as we know it.
The truth is some will take the shilling, some will not, and if
England wants to have a fully professional game -- and that verdict is
still awaited -- then let them.
I can't quite see why the likes of Craig Joiner, studying to be an
engineer, or Stewart Campbell, doing the same in architecture, or
Edinburgh University student Gregor Townsend or farmer Kenny Logan would
want to be either full-time professionals or residents of England.
So who longs for this professional circuit? Not the Scottish clubs.
They have told the SRU to vote against any further erosion of the
amateur principle. Given these club stalwarts may not know as much as
some ex-internationalists, but ''ye ken wha's mair likely to be heatin'
up the pies'' as they say in the Borders.
I think rugby is a magnificent sport. We have a largely clean game,
free of cheats feigning injury to gain advantage, without bribery or
corruption, a social activity enjoyed as much by spectators as players,
a sport which is at the heart of many small town communities. We should
be very careful before we throw all that away.
What we must do is attract more working-class support, is the cry.
Yes, of course, we want rugby to be a classless activity and in the
Borders it most certainly is.
What we can live without, however, is masses of spectators chanting
songs of hate or fans howling abuse at players.
Ask yourself this: if amateur rugby is so awful why is it that
sponsors are queueing up to be part of the action? Is not one of the
attractions for them the very difference between this and other sports?
For such sentiments I shall be branded as a member of the King Canute
Club or the Flat Earth Society.
Professional rugby, like death, may be inevitable. That does not mean
to say we have to look forward to it.

STEWART Campbell, the Dundee HS FP lock who makes his Five Nations'
debut against Ireland at Murrayfield on Saturday, has already had one
wish come true.
Campbell, a strapping 6ft 6ins and 16st 8lb, is no rugby lightweight,
but in international terms he is but a callow youth.
The international lineout, where the Dundee University architecture
student must earn his corn, is a no-holds-barred amalgam of all-in
wrestling and guerrilla warfare. For good reason the lineout has been
called rugby's ''illegitimate child.''
Small wonder, then, that Campbell permitted himself a wry smile when
the news came from Dublin that his opposite number Neil Francis, injured
against England, would not be recovered in time for the Murrayfield
clash.
''Yes, I'm quite pleased the boy Francis isn't playing. He's been
around the paddock a bit. He's a real streetwise individual and he'll be
a big miss for the Irish.''
Campbell and his second-row partner Damian Cronin made hay while the
rain poured at Murrayfield against the Canadians 10 days ago. They
cleaned up on the touchline where Campbell's athleticism paid dividends
for Scotland with a lavish supply of quality ball.
Like all debutant internationalists the young lock found the step up
to full international rugby an enlightening experience. ''Yes, it is
true what they say. It is so much faster and more intense. Canada cut
loose near the end and I was pretty knackered. The conditions were
atrocious too. I've never seen Murrayfield so bad.''
Three Scotland 'A' caps had been preparation of a sort but, as
Campbell conceded, the only preparation for international rugby is . . .
international rugby.
As a son of Fintry, Campbell began his rugby education at Balfron HS
under the tutelage of Bobby Telfer. He progressed to under-18 rugby with
West of Scotland from where he gained Scotland under-18 honours.
The academic move to Dundee saw him enlist with Dundee HS FP where,
under the stern eye of the then High School coach David Leslie, Campbell
progressed to outings with Scotland under-19 and under-21.
Campbell acknowledges the help which the Scotland 1984 Grand Slam
flanker has provided as he has climbed the representative ladder.
''David has been great. It's good to take advice from a guy who has been
there and done it all,'' he said.
Leslie was a real kamikaze pilot of a wing-forward. ''It's all about
sacrificing your body,'' he used to say. Human sacrifice is not yet on
the Campbell menu, but he is grateful for the motivatory spirit with
which Leslie imbued his Tayside team before giving up hands-on coaching
duties.
''David certainly makes his thoughts known. He's a great motivator
and, because he is an architect and I spent a year with his practice
last year, he's been good for me in my academic work as well.''
Campbell looks forward to Saturday's Five Nations' debut with relish.
''Ireland will be completely different from Canada. Murrayfield was only
half full but it will be jam-packed with the Irish. The atmosphere will
be magic.
''I think the Irish will be more fiery than the Canadians. I'm really
looking forward to it but, to be quite honest, I'm trying to keep it at
the back of my mind. If I start to think about all the implications --
you know, Murrayfield, Five Nations, Flower of Scotland -- then I'll
start worrying.
''My college work helps to keep my mind off it until we're all
together as a squad, and then it'll be the only thing on my mind.
College and rugby is quite a good mix. One is using the brain and the
other is . . . well, lot's of running about.
Then, no doubt with an eye on the national coaches' exhortations for
total and intelligent rugby, Campbell added quickly: ''Of course there's
more to it than that but you know what I mean . . .''

THE staging of future Commonwealth Rowing Championships has been put
in jeopardy by a Commonwealth Games Federation ruling.
Following the success last summer of the inaugural championships in
Canada, the next event was due to take place in Kuala Lumpur in
conjunction with the 1998 Commonwealth Games. But the CGF have decided
that single sport championship events will not be given official
sanction or recognition if they are staged within six months of the
Commonwealth Games.
It seems unlikely that any practical decision can be made about where
and when to stage the next Commonwealth championships until the
governing bodies meet at the World championships in Finland in
September.
However, one possible rescue is being considered. If Canada win the
right to stage the 1999 World championships, they would offer to stage
the Commonwealth championships as a warm-up event.

MARK Ramprakash has 48 hours to prepare himself for a whole new ball
game. The 25-year-old batsman looks set to step into England's side for
Friday's final Test against Australia in Perth.
From facing spinners on slow pitches in India, the twenty-second
player called into England's senior squad this trip will find himself up
against a pace dominated attack operating on one of the world's fastest
wickets.
''All my preparation for this winter's A tour was on low, flat
pitches,'' said Ramprakash, who now finds himself in Australia because
of the tour-ending injuries suffered by Graeme Hick, Alec Stewart and
Neil Fairbrother.
''I saw plenty of spinners in India, but we hardly came up against a
seamer. It's going to be totally different in Perth,'' said Ramprakash.
''It's going to be hard if I am picked, but I'm sure I will adjust,
even if that means a lot of extra work in the nets beforehand.''
Whether he plays or not, England will be glad to have Ramprakash
around as they bid for a series-levelling victory over Australia.
In 1993 he helped to beat the Old Enemy at The Oval by scoring a
best-yet 64 after taking the place of broken finger victim Graham
Thorpe, and on Monday he was on the field when England completed their
amazing fourth Test victory in Adelaide -- acting as a substitute
fielder for John Crawley, who was troubled by a stiff neck.
''I've become a bit of a lucky mascot against Australia,'' said
Ramprakash.
* DAVID Hemp emerged as English cricket's new hero yesterday, when his
superb unbeaten 99, plus a captain's innings of 65 from Alan Wells, gave
England victory by five wickets against India A. The victory also
clinched the three-match series 2-0.
Hemp's joy, however, was tainted a little by the news -- conveyed to
him as he was halfway through his second celebratory beer in the team
hotel -- that he had been denied a fifth first-class century.
He and partner Dominic Cork had scampered back for a third run, taking
Hemp to 100 not out on the scoreboard. But, as England's target of 254
had been reached when the pair completed two, the umpires later ruled
that the third run was invalid.
Hemp was disappointed at the way cricket's laws had been invoked to
the letter, but added: ''The most important thing is that we won. Some
of the gloss had been taken off -- but I should have hit it for four!''
* A RECORD unbroken fourth-wicket partnership of 247 between the
Flower brothers, Grant and Andy, saw Zimbabwe recover from three early
blows on the opening day of the first Test against Pakistan in Harare.
While opener Grant ground his way to a undefeated 88, brother Andy
powered to an unbeaten 142, his second Test century, as Zimbabwe reached
289 for three by the close.

TRADING down from a larger property when the family has flown the nest
often poses a problem. You want fewer rooms, but you still want plenty
of space within the rooms.
Finding a smaller home which offers the space for your large scale
furniture can be difficult, but agents Slater Hogg &amp; Howison believe
they have the answer with a large apartment at No.3 Mannofield in
Bearsden.
This is one of only three ground floor apartments of its size. With
virtually level access (only one step up), the accommodation internally
is unusually spacious and offers the convenience of bungalow-style
living, but with added security and without the need to maintain the
garden.
Mannofield is a development of ten luxury apartments centrally
situated off Chesters Road within the Thorn area of Old Bearsden and set
in around two acres of lawn and wooded grounds.
The development is self-factored with annual costs of around #500 per
annum which covers building insurance, window cleaning and garden
maintenance.
There is a security door to entrance hallway, and the accomodation
consists of a reception hall, 17ft by 15ft lounge, separate dining room,
new dining kitchen with appliances, main bedroom with five-piece
bathroom en-suite, two further bedrooms and bathroom. Single garage.
Features include gas fired central heating, double glazing, patio doors
on to a terrace, dining kitchen, two full bathrooms and extensive fitted
storage space.
Slater Hogg &amp; Howison is looking for offers over #135,000.

CELTIC have promised that all supporters who applied for shares in the
club will receive them. More than 10,000 supporters responded to the
share offer, with applications for shares received amounting to more
than #9.8m -- #4.4m above the target.
Managing director Fergus McCann promised: ''All unsuccessful
applicants who applied before 10am on January 24 will be offered the
shares in full that they have applied for with all shareholder rights
and benefits.''
Around 8000 applicants who have already received their shares will
have the chance to attend an extraordinary general meeting on February
24 to give the go-ahead to increase the share capital.
* THE postponement of last night's Tennents Scottish Cup third-round
tie between Hamilton and Rangers at Firhill, because of a waterlogged
pitch, means the first division club face the prospect of playing three
matches in five days.
That situation comes about because the SFA, despite a request from
Rangers to have the match played next Wednesday, are sticking rigidly to
the rules.
The match will go ahead at Firhill on Monday, and a replay would go
ahead at Ibrox 48 hours later. Hamilton are scheduled to meet St Mirren
at Firhill on league business on Saturday.
Hamilton would welcome the extra revenue, but a replay would have
players virtually on their knees. Rangers also face the prospect of
three matches in five days -- they meet Dundee United in a league match
at Ibrox on Saturday. With their resources, though, it would be less of
an irritation.

Falkirk 0, Motherwell 0
match abandoned
THE lights went out, the fans went home and nobody had a good time.
Now Falkirk and Motherwell will have to play their Tennents Scottish Cup
third-round tie again next Monday night.
The floodlights opposite the main stand failed seven minutes after
half-time, but after 18 minutes had gone by and Brockville was still in
a twilight zone the game was abandoned.
The supporters of both clubs in the crowd of around 6000 were issued
with vouchers for the replay. Fortunately, neither team had gained an
advantage.
There were many who felt the game could have continued. The far side
of the field could be seen from the stand, but referee Jim McCluskey
felt that was not good enough to continue. He was supported by
Motherwell manager Alex McLeish.
0 Ironically, Falkirk, who had been ouplayed in the first half, were
beginning to get their act together when the far side was plunged into
darkness. Their manager, Jim Jefferies, said that water had penetrated a
main cable.
''It shows how much we need a new stadium,'' he said. ''Hopefully we
will get one started this summer, but there are still problems to sort
out with the site.''
Fakirk have not had much luck with this tie. It was postponed on
Saturday only a couple of hours before kick-off, and then the local
police refused to allow the teams to replay on Sunday.
Motherwell secretary Alan Dick was delighted with the patience shown
by the Motherwell fans as they queued up for their vouchers. The club
had paid for coaches to bring 3000 fans and will probably do so again on
Monday. Meanwhile, Hibs wait to see who they meet in the next round.
FALKIRK -- Parks, Hamilton, McQueen, Oliver, Weir, McGowan, May,
Henderson, McDonald, Fulton, McKenzie. Substitutes -- Rice, James,
Lamont.
MOTHERWELL -- Woods, Shannon, McKinnon, Krivokapic, Martin, McCart,
Lambert, Dolan, Coyne, Arnott, McMillan. Substitutes -- McGrillen,
Philliben, Howie.
Referee -- J McCluskey (Stewarton).

A CAMPAIGN is being launched today to highlight the dangers and
injuries caused by shaking small children.
Shaking babies can kill or cause torn blood vessels, blindness,
paralysis, and convulsions, according to the National Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Children.
The Royal Scottish Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Children is
backing the campaign.
Out of 16 babies admitted to intensive care at Liverpool's Alder Hey
Hospital with injuries that could be attributed to shaking, seven died
and nine became severely disabled.
One baby girl was admitted as a suspected near cot death, but X-rays
revealed fractured ribs and that her brain was swollen and bleeding. The
girl survived, but is completely blind, deaf, and paralysed from the
neck down.
Dr Anne Stafford, social policy research officer for the Royal
Scottish Society, said: ''Rough handling by adults, even in play, can be
very dangerous -- especially for babies but also for small children.
''Sometimes adults are provoked into it because the child won't stop
crying. Every parent knows this can be very difficult to cope with, but
there are ways, and help can be provided if it is a continuing problem.
''We hope that, by helping people to understand how the damage is done
and how serious it can be, we will help prevent the tragic consequences
of this kind of injury.''

A 44-YEAR-OLD man took a drink and drugs cocktail before carrying out
a rape, the High Court in Inverness was told yesterday.
Donald Ross asked his victim's forgiveness before being jailed for
six-and-a-half years.
The court heard that Ross grabbed the 26-year-old by the hair, took
her to an upstairs bedroom in her home, and threw her on a bed.
He put his hands on her throat then raped her, warning: ''If you don't
let me do what I want to do, I will do you in.''
During the ordeal, Ross, unemployed and formerly of Rosehill,
Aberdeen, also punched the woman, leaving her bleeding heavily from her
nose.
Advocate-depute Ian Bonomy, QC, said the woman was so terrified she
remained in the house until morning when she went to a neighbour's and
called the police.
The defence counsel said Ross had been drinking heavily, had smoked
cannabis, and had taken medication for alcohol-related problems on the
day he carried out the attack.
He said Ross was ''devastated'' about what he had done to the woman
and hoped she would find it in her to forgive him.
Ross admitted rape on June 7 and 8 last year at a house in Alness, and
failing to turn up for trial set down for the High Court in Inverness on
November 4.
He also admitted previous convictions.
Lord MacLean said that in jailing Ross he was ''doing justice and
acting in accordance with mercy''.

JUST when they were showing the rest of the UK industry the way out of
recession, Scotland's builders are being squeezed between interest rate
increases and the spiralling cost of land. Early last year development
land in Edinburgh cost around #200,000 an acre, but by September a price
of #700,000 was reported.
That price was achieved for an especially good site, but with ten
bidders throwing their hods into the ring the size of the winning offer
shook the industry to its roof slates.
In the West of Scotland prices have more than doubled. It's the same
in Grampian Region where a flurry of turf wars have broken out as
developers fight each other for any available sites and values have
risen from #150,000 to #300,000 in less than a year.
Some 14 bidders competed against each other for sites in East Kilbride
and Renfrew recently. ''There is no evidence from the first few weeks of
this year that land prices won't keep on rising in 1995,'' says Sid
Fowler, chairman of the Scottish House-Builders Association.
Despite the land rush, last year saw 17,330 new housing starts in
Scotland -- a 22% increase on the previous year and a figure which
outperformed every other region of the UK.
The Scottish industry is hoping to maintain that momentum this year,
but the shortage of land and continuing uneconomic certainty will ensure
a jittery year. The builders claim that planning hold-ups are pushing up
the price of land, a claim disputed by Strathclyde Region's planners.
Sid Fowler says: ''The home of our dreams starts off with a very high
cost -- the price of land. On a house valued at #100,000, the outlay on
the land element alone will be around #20,000, before a turf is cut.''
Having outbid their rivals, there are three ways in which builders can
make an expensive development site stack up financially. Some are
pushing up the prices of their homes, but there is a limit as to how far
this can go. Others are pressurising the planners to allow them a
greater density of dwellings on the site -- or to reduce room sizes and
specification in a bid to decrease the construction costs.
One Scottish representative of a national volume builder said that his
board had firmly instructed all managers not to talk about land prices
to the press.
''I can tell you about how well our sales are doing, but if I talk to
you about escalating land prices every farmer with an available field
thinks that he is going to make more than #250,000 an acre. Prices are
far too high, and talking about them just fuels the fire.''
He conceded that the industry had to take its share of the blame for
the upward spiral. ''I've no idea how some of these builders can make
the the sites work at the prices they have paid. In fact, it's becoming
clear that there are sites where the builders simply won't get their
money back because they paid too much.''
As a result, some builders are trying to buy their land in off-market
deals, avoiding the need to bid against each other. CALA Homes builds
its landbank by offering landowners options to purchase. Cash does not
have to be paid upfront and the company can take its time in acquiring
consent for residential use.
Land is only paid for when it has its planning consent and when the
market is ready for it. As a result, the company avoids the worst
effects of the land price rollercoaster -- and has options on 7500 plots
throughout the UK.
All structure and local plans are supposed to to maintain a five-year
''effective'' land supply, that is land which is suitable for housing
development and which is owned by a builder or a willing seller. Many
builders claim that this five-year supply is not being maintained,
triggering the price spiral.
Regional planners say that many of the problems arise in local
districts where councillors bow to local NIMBY pressures and oppose any
new developments in their area.
Changes in local government next year are likely to exacerbate that
situation. More than 5000 new homes are required in Strathclyde by 1997
if targets agreed by the Scottish Office are to be met. As builders
struggle to stake out their share of the development high ground, prices
will continue to rise, unless a new land supply can be found.
Yet such a supply already exists in embarrassingly generous quantities
throughout the central belt of Scotland. It's called ''brownfield''
land, locations which have been previously used for industrial or
commercial purposes.
It has been estimated that some 5000 acres of land in Glasgow is
derelict -- some 9% of all the land within the city boundary. If every
residential or commercial development currently proposed for the city
was built on those sites, Glasgow would still be swathed in vast
stretches of weedy terrain.
Yet the green belt is under intense pressure. This pressure could be
reduced and derelict land throughout the central belt turned over to
housing if the government was prepared to help pay the cost of site
preparation.
South of the Border, public money is widely available for the cleaning
up and improvement of such sites. The Scottish Office recently announced
that the Glasgow Development Agency would be given #3m a year for three
years to carry out this sort of work. It's a start, but the green belt
will continue to suffer creeping development unless such finance becomes
much more widely available. And the market will respond. When L&amp;C Homes
developed the former Stewarts &amp; Lloyds tube works site at Tollcross in
Glasgow's East End (not known as a site of outstanding natural beauty)
the company sold more than 400 houses in four years.
Many of the purchasers were people who had been forced to move out of
the area to places like Cumbernauld but wanted to come back. They were
not put off by the idea of living on a former industrial site.
Volume builder Bellway Homes specialises in developments on derelict
land. Director Ian Mahon says: ''There is absolutely no resistance from
buyers to former brownfield sites. We're seeing very strong sales levels
on such sites at Drumchapel, Garthamlock and Blantyre.''
When the company organised meeting for potential buyers at the
Drumchapel site many people had to be turned away, such was the level of
interest.
With almost a tenth of its landmass lying derelict, Glasgow needs
these sort of schemes. A higher spend on decontamination and site
preparation would unlock new sites, strengthen urban communities and
ease the pressure on the green belt. And we would not need so many
motorways.
Failure to improve the supply of land could have dire consequences for
the property industry. Sid Fowler believes Scotland's cautious approach
during the Eighties helped to avoid the massive write-downs in land
values and negative equity which burned a hole in the South of England's
property market.
''But if we are to avoid the consequences of such extremes, then the
supply of land must be maintained at an acceptable level. To many
observers the private housing industry must appear never to learn from
its experiences.''

DUNDEE United manager Ivan Golac is convinced Brazilian striker Sergio
can help move the Taysiders up the premier division at Firhill tonight
-- if the game beats the weather at the fourth attempt.
There are fears that the game will be called off yet again, but Golac
remains confident that his boy from Brazil will spark a United revival
if the game gets the green light.
He made his debut against Motherwell in a 6-1 win 10 days ago, but had
to sit out the goal-less draw with Clyde in the Scottish Cup last
Saturday.
The United manager said: ''The difference between the two results
speaks for itself as far as Sergio is concerned.''
Also back in the United squad is unhappy midfielder Jim McInally, who
was forced to sit out the Clyde game because of back trouble.
United yesterday received clearance for Portuguese defender Quim, who
has been on trial for the last week. the #400,000-rated Vitoria Setubal
player will be able to play in tomorrow's reserve game against Hearts at
Tannadice.
Golac had insisted he would not make any signing move for the player
unless he had been able first to watch him in a competitive match.
Former Hearts player Scott Crabbe will also face the Tynecastle second
string as he continues his comeback after breaking a leg 11 months ago.
Thistle will have striker Roddy Grant back after suspension, but Rod
McDonald is doubtful and manager John Lambie says he will give Chic
Charnley a rest, because he has been carrying an injury.

SO the Government's Minister for Sport has confidence in football's
desire to investigate its own people and to take whatever action may be
necessary to rid the game of any wrongs, does he? Ian Sproat, the
minister in question, probably still believes in the tooth fairy.
What a naive little minister he must be. You can just hear him: ''Eric
Cantona slipped and fell into the crowd, that's all . . . Vinny Jones?
He's just a tad slow in the tackle.''
It is all very simple. Where there are millions of pounds sloshing
around from one business to another and when sundry characters of
colourful reputation are involved in wheeling and dealing, the chances
are a shilling or two might disappear somewhere in the process.
Football is a business in which perks and huge signing-on fees are as
much a part of the fabric as inconsistent referees and rotten players.
The game's star performers are wealthy and where there are large sums of
money, there will be those around anxious to deal in temptation.
Inevitably the human condition leaves us all prone to greed.
Labour MP Kate Hoey was entitled to call the other night for an
independent inquiry into certain aspects of football's finances, and it
was wrong and foolish of Sproat to suggest the game could be entrusted
to clean up its own act. Football, especially south of the Border, is
reeling from a succession of incidents and accusations which have
severely tarnished the image.
However, it would be wrong and naive to Sproat's extent to believe
only English football is prone to questionable practices. The Scottish
game will have its share of cases worthy of closer scrutiny. Greed
doesn't stop at the Border.
In fact, Celtic's current board had to reach agreement in principle
with the Inland Revenue to pay #175,000 in relation to transfer dealings
under a previous regime, which suggests irregularities.
There is a growing belief among the supporters that they are paying to
watch a sub-standard product played by people who are more concerned
with improving their salaries rather than their abilities. Also, the
most recent incident involving Cantona has done nothing to convince the
public that football does not consider itself to be above the law.
Perhaps some powerful outside influence is precisely what football
requires instead of relying on the report which the FA Premier League
Commission will produce within a fortnight. Does anyone believe the game
will rat on itself?
The fact that football felt compelled to launch its own sleaze inquiry
suggests the administration are not satisfied with current procedures.
Why then should they be so alarmed at the prospect of an independent
inquiry? Could they be afraid of what an outside agency might uncover by
delving into a transfer business with a turnover of #70m a year?
Hoey referred specifically to the transfers of John Jensen, from
Brondby to Arsenal, and Teddy Sheringham, from Nottingham Forest to
Tottenham Hotspur. She pointed out that in the Jensen case, Brondby were
given only #900,000 of the #1.57m Arsenal were supposed to have paid.
This meant a large sum was paid into a Guernsey firm, Interclub, which
the MP said is run by Norwegian agent Rune Hauge. Arsenal's manager,
George Graham, of course, has been under investigation and has admitted
receiving ''a gift'' of #285,000. A gift, if we wish to call it that,
which he has given back to Arsenal.
Sheringham's move, Hoey reminded everyone when she initiated a House
of Commons debate into corruption within football, went through at a
time when Brian Clough and Terry Venables managed Forest and Spurs
respectively, and she asked if any evidence of fraud had been uncovered
over allegations of bribes involving this transfer.
Hoey also mentioned Liverpool, Manchester United, and Oldham as well
as referring to a deal between Aston Villa (when Ron Atkinson was
manager) and Real Sociedad.
The Vauxhall MP's concern is shared by many people, but not Sproat or,
apparently, the FA, which is a pity. A full and open investigation would
help clear the air, perhaps even throw a brighter, whiter light on the
game. Surely that would do no harm in these days when a player (Cantona)
can attack a fan and another (Arsenal's Paul Merson) is wheeled before
the world to admit to drug and alcohol addiction.
Scattered around the more glaring testaments which prove football is
so deeply into a mire of impropriety it would need a five-inch stud to
stay upright, are many other less appalling cases, but anyone who
believes football is above corruption i a fool, or the Minister for
Sport.
Although football has moved into the modern world with attention to
all-seated stadiums, the transfer of assets, ie players, remains a
shady, secretive area. Many deals are still done in corners where middle
men, who are not in any way benefactors of the game, whisper promises
and the greater the sums of money involved, the greater the chances of
corruption.
It is the nature of the business, but one which must be changed. The
fans deserve as much.

A DOCTOR and nurse have been suspended and disciplined after the death
of a second patient in two years at Ninewells Hospital, Dundee, from an
identical drugs overdose.
A hospital spokesman said last night that an inquiry was to be set up.
It would chaired by the chairman of Dundee Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust
and include a pharmacist and nurse from outside Dundee.
Mr Derek Young, 34, died last week after being given six times the
recommended dosage of morphine. Instead of being injected with 5mg of
the pain-killer, he was given 30mg.
The spokesman said a fatal accident inquiry into the death of another
patient at Ninewells in similar circumstances had found the procedures
at the hospital were ''adequate''.
He said: ''It is extremely distressing that procedures were not
followed in this case and condolences have been offered to the patient's
relatives.''
Staff in Ward 16 where Mr Young died have been interviewed by police.
His mother, Agnes, of Laird Street, Dundee, said the family had been
told by hospital authorities that ''a terrible mistake was made''.
In February 1992, Mrs Georgina Dawson, a 71-year-old widow, died after
two nurses failed to follow procedures for administering medicines from
the locked dangerous drugs cabinet.
They selected the wrong carton of morphine ampules and failed to read
a label warning that the 30mg ampules were in excess of the usual
dosage. A fatal accident inquiry found her death had resulted from staff
error.
Labour's Scottish health spokesman, Mr John McAllion, last night
called for changes in drug administration at Ninewells and accused
management of failing to learn the lessons from Mrs Dawson's death. He
said: ''Are we to believe that exactly the same staff error has been
made for the second time in two years? Now, with the deaths of two
patients, there are clearly grounds for serious concern.''
The public affairs manager for the hospital, Mr Malcolm McInnes, said:
''Following the death of a patient at Ninewells Hospital, the
procurator-fiscal has ordered an investigation into the circumstances.
''In addition to co-operating with the procurator-fiscal, an internal
hospital inquiry has also been established. Pending the outcome of these
investigations it would be inappropriate to speculate on the
circumstances involved.''

THE USA won the three-match women's hockey Test series with Great
Britain with a 3-1 victory in the final match in San Diego, and so the
Americans took the honours by two matches to one.
There will undoubtedly be questions asked of the players and team
coach Sue Slocombe, because when the British defence was under pressure
in the early stages nothing was done to rectify the situation.
Full back Jill Atkins managed only one pass in six attempts during a
nine-minute period in the first half, while Lucy Cope at left back, who
was preferred to Scotland's Susan Fraser, struggled throughout the first
half to close down the American right flank.
At the outset, Diane Renilson managed to take a penalty corner effort
in the first minute off the line from Barbara Marois. Then, at the other
end, Atkins had a shot saved on the line, and Pauline Robertson hit the
side netting.
The USA took the lead in the twelfth minute, when Kris Fillat found
the target, but the British girls felt her shot had been hit from
outside the circle.
The umpire ignored their complaints, but justice was done after the
interval when Slocombe readjusted her side. Fraser was brought into the
game while Susan MacDonald was reunited with her Scotland colleague,
Rhona Simpson, in the vanguard of the attack, and within two minutes the
visitors were back on level terms through an opportunist goal by
MacDonald.
However, the joy was short-lived, for within a minute the Americans
had regained the advantage from another corner conversion by Eleanor
Stone, and in the fortieth minute a shot from an acute angle by Marcia
Pankratz gave the USA a two-goal cushion.
The British girls worked tirelessly to regain the initiative, but by
then the USA had settled into their rhythm.

CROESO gartref, Elenid -- that's the message waiting for
five-month-old Elenid Rhys Williams when she goes home in a fortnight
thanks to a life-saving four-week stay at the Royal Hospital for Sick
Children in Glasgow.
Brothers Alun, eight, and Gwion, four, are waiting in Caernarvon to
say welcome home to the baby sister they have hardly seen outside
hospital.
Elenid -- born in Bangor Hospital, North Wales, 15 weeks prematurely
-- made the journey to Glasgow after a viral infection, RSV, developed
over Christmas into broncheolitis.
She was flown by air ambulance from Liverpool after doctors at the
Alder Hey children's hospital decided Yorkhill's pioneering ECMO machine
was her best chance of survival. Now she is to spend a final two weeks
back in Liverpool before going home to Wales.
The baby spent 17 days on ECMO -- extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation
-- which takes over the functions of the lungs. Blood is drawn off,
cleansed of carbon dioxide and re-oxygenated, reheated to body
temperature and passed back.
Mr Karl Davis, consultant paediatric surgeon on the ECMO team, said
yesterday: ''Her lungs had suffered a degree of damage. The machine let
us rest her lungs while the infection ran its course. Without the
machine I doubt if she would be alive today.''
Elenid and her parents, Cledwyn, 47, a contruction lecturer, and
Rhianwen, 43, a former policewoman, will set off today back to Alder
Hey, where doctors will decide when she can go home to Caernarvon --
probably in a couple of weeks.
Mrs Williams said: ''We have been overwhelmed by the skill and
dedication of the staff here. We would like to say thank you -- but how
do you thank this dedicated team of doctors and nurses for saving your
child's life?''
Her daughter weighed 1lb 15oz when she was born on August 28, but Mrs
Williams said: ''She is now 7lb 3oz and has given us her first smile.''
Yorkhill is one of five centres in the UK providing ECMO.

SCOTTISH squash champion Peter Nicol has been given the chance to gain
revenge over British champion Peter Marshall in a #2000 winner-take-all
challenge match in Edinburgh on March 15.
The match between the best of British -- at No.2 in the world,
Marshall is ranked three places higher than Nicol -- is to mark the
official opening of the recently upgraded Heriot-Watt University
facilities.
Now recognised as Scotland's national squash centre, the #500,000
improvements include an exhibition court with theatre seating for 180,
plus four glass-backed courts with a spectators' gallery.
In addition, a tournament administration area also is expected to help
in Scotland's big quest to host future world tournaments.
The organisers are hopeful of enticing television coverage of the
Nicol v Marshall contest, which will take place on the exhibition court,
and tickets for the encounter are certain to be in great demand.
It will certainly be a rare chance for the local supporters to witness
Nicol's talents against such a top-class opponent.
Marshall's is the only world top-10 scalp still to be claimed by the
Scot in major tournaments.
Last year, the pair met in the final of the British championship and
the semi-finals of both the Portuguese Open and the World Open.
However, Nicol did break the hoodoo with a win in an exhibition match
in Aberdeen last March, and he will be hopeful of a repeat in front of
the home crowd in six weeks' time.
Next month, the Scottish National Junior championships and the
Scottish Junior Inter-area championships are both scheduled to take
place at Heriot-Watt.
* OGMORE Valley Dragons may have squeezed Lingfield out of the
end-of-season play-offs, thanks to a 3-0 win in their Super Squash
League clash.
The Dragons now have 16 points in fourth place, five more than
Lingfield.

Nicosia, Tuesday
THE trial of three British soldiers charged in Cyprus with killing a
young Danish woman tour guide was adjourned for two more weeks.
Hearings will resume on February 15 with the participation of new
Attorney General Alecos Markides.
''It will give the new Attorney General time to study the case further
and be ready to appear before the court,'' said prosecutor Petros
Clerides.
The Supreme Court will hear legal arguments on a criminal court's
decision in November to grant a pre-trial hearing and complaints over
the composition of that court.
It will then decide if prison warders violated the soldiers' rights by
taking away the written notes of two of the accused.
Alan Ford, 26, from Birmingham, Justin Fowler, 27, from Falmouth,
Cornwall, and Jeff Pernell, 23, from Oldbury, West Midlands, are accused
of the abduction and manslaughter of Louise Jensen, 23, last September.
Her battered body was found in a shallow grave near the resort town of
Paralimni.
The three soldiers, who served at a British base on the Mediterranean
island, are detained at Nicosia Central Prison.--Reuter.

EARNINGS in Scotland are drifting down from those in the rest of
Britain and Scots are more likely to be made redundant, it was claimed
yesterday at the launch of a joint campaign, Let's Get Working, against
unemployment by the Labour Party and STUC.
Mr John McFall, Labour's Scottish economic spokesman, said wages
plunged from 99.6% of the British average to 92.6% last year. Scots had
a 6.2% chance of becoming unemployed compared to 5.7% in England and
Wales. However, Scots males had a 7.9% chance of facing redundancy
compared to 5.9% in London.

Bucharest, Tuesday
A ROMANIAN gymnastics coach was jailed for eight years today for
beating to death an 11-year-old girl during a training session.
A Bucharest court found Florin Gheorghe, 25, a former trainer at the
capital's elite Dinamo sports school, guilty of manslaughter after the
November 1993 killing of gymnast Adriana Giurca.
Under Romanian law the charges carry a maximum jail sentence of 10
years.
Gheorghe, who has been in detention since February 1994, was not
present in court, and neither were Giurca's parents, who issued the
lawsuit over their daughter's killing.
After learning from lawyers of Gheorghe's sentence, the girl's mother,
Maria, said the court had been too lenient.
''That trainer hit my daughter like a beast and her death was more
than manslaughter. It was murder and he should have been punished for
that,'' she said.
The court also set ''moral damages'' at 10 million lei (#3733), which
Gheorghe will have to pay to the Giurca family.
''The money is nothing for me and my husband. No money can bring our
daughter back to life,'' Maria Giurca said.
The Giurcas said they would sue the Dinamo school, which they accused
of ''irresponsibility'' in employing what they called ''a criminal
trainer''.
The court heard testimony that Gheorghe had flown into a rage during a
training session on the balance beam, throwing the tiny girl to the
ground and beating her. Adriana died in hospital several hours later.
''If sports performances are built on physical and moral ordeal, all
the gold medals that Romania won throughout the years mean nothing,''
Adriana's father said.
Romanian sports officials have rejected accusations that beatings were
used in training to turn Romanian gymnasts into top performers.
Commenting on Adriana's death, Romanian Gymnastics Federation
president Adrian Stoica called it an ''unfortunate event''.
''Such behaviour is unusual in our gymnastics schools,'' he said.
He added: ''It was an accident.''
However, the girl's team-mates told the court corporal punishment was
''normal'' in their school whenever they failed to perform to their
trainers' exacting standards.
''We accepted the beatings and the pain because we were convinced that
this would open the door to top performance for us,'' a young girl
gymnast told a court hearing last week.
Octavian Bellu, chief trainer at Romania's Olympic gymnastics centre
in the Transylvanian city of Deva, said that despite changes in Romania
since the 1989 fall of communism, what he called ''an iron discipline''
was still the best way to attain top performances. -- Reuter.

SNP leader Alex Salmond moved yesterday to isolate critics of his
stance on a devolved Scottish parliament, pointing out that attacks on
him related to a firm party policy passed overwhelmingly five years ago
by annual conference.
He said he was entirely relaxed about the furore over a Scotland on
Sunday report, which he claimed wrongly suggested that there had been a
change in SNP policy towards the plans by Labour and Liberal Democrats
for a parliament in Edinburgh with limited powers.
However, an indication that he would use the heated exchange to
isolate long-standing critics Jim Sillars and Iain Lawson came when he
took the opportunity on BBC Radio Scotland to condemn the former as ''an
old volcano where each eruption was less significant than the last'',
and described the latter, a fellow member of the national executive, as
''a cross that everyone in the SNP has to bear''.
Mr Lawson argues in The Herald today that there has been a policy
shift by Mr Salmond on the SNP stance towards a devolved parliament, and
he points to what he sees as a geographical schism in the party in which
a leadership based on support in the North-east fails to understand the
problems of activists taking on Labour in their Central Belt heartland.
The SNP hierarchy stressed that policy had been unchanged since a
motion passed at Perth in 1990 which stated: ''This conference supports
Independence in Europe, not a devolved assembly, but recognises that if
an assembly should be set up, elections to that body would provide an
alternative to a UK General Election and an SNP victory would constitute
a mandate for independence.''
Nothing Mr Salmond had said contradicted or deflected that, said the
party's chief executive, Mr Michael Russell, who confirmed that SNP
support at Westminster for a devolved assembly would depend entirely on
the detail of any Bill. They would not, however, campaign in support of
such a Bill but might table amendments designed to strengthen what was
on offer to make it in effect a sovereign Scottish parliament
controlling all matters Scottish.
Mr Salmond said he was disappointed by Mr Lawson's continuing
criticism because he had understood that he now accepted that the
newspaper which started it all had got it wrong.
''I am extremely relaxed about all this,'' he said. ''When you get
into a dispute -- such as the Tories on Europe or Labour on Clause 4 --
the advantage is that you get wall-to-wall publicity. The bad side is if
there is an underlying dispute. The beauty of this for us is that we get
the publicity when there isn't actually any dispute.''
The Shadow Scottish Secretary, Mr George Robertson, sought to
capitalise on the SNP row by writing to parliamentary leader Margaret
Ewing to say their attitude to devolution ''has descended into complete
anarchy''.
She responded by pointing out that the policy had been unchanged for
five years, and she challenged Labour to publish its proposed Bill for
an assembly and guarantee that all Labour candidates at the next General
Election would back it.

DUTCH Prime Minister Wim Kok yesterday pledged new measures to
strengthen dikes along rivers as tens of thousands of people fled
low-lying homes in some of the worst flooding this century.
Kok, speaking amid the second major flood alert in 13 months, tried to
quell outrage over the persistent delays in reinforcing the water
defences which have kept the Dutch dry for hundreds of years.
Bureaucracy and zealous environmentalists were blamed for the delays,
and the Environment Ministry called for co-ordination with Germany,
France, and Belgium to regulate development and curb the risk of
flooding in the first place.
''Now is not the time for accusations,'' Kok told parliament in a
nationally televised address. ''The Netherlands has a long history and a
great reputation for its defences against the sea. We must show what we
are worth.''
He pledged progress towards a scheme such as the Delta Project which
followed massive floods in 1953, when more than 1800 people died as a
storm whipped up spring tides and sent North Sea waves crashing over sea
defences.
The government then built a huge storm-surge barrier. However, in the
1990s, with the threat coming not from the sea but from the swollen
Rhine, Maas, and Waal Rivers, Kok said that many had underestimated the
danger from rivers.
With more than two-thirds of the Dutch living below sea-level, it is a
matter of national pride as well as survival to ensure defences are
reinforced conscientiously and regularly.
''Something must be done with the mountain of paperwork that is
delaying dike-strengthening,'' wrote the mass-circulation daily De
Telegraaf in a leader column.
''When it comes to the battle with water, the safety of the people
must come first.''
Newspapers say plans to reinforce dikes can now take up to five years
to cross all the hurdles, including compensation for nearby landowners
and environmental and planning rules.
Some areas, including the Land van Maas en Waal isthmus between the
Rhine and Maas -- known as the ''bathtub'' -- lie almost 20ft below the
winter dikes.
''If those dikes break, things happen very suddenly. The water pours
in,'' said a spokesman for the Transport and Waterworks Ministry.
''We advise people not to settle there -- but if they want to, that's
up to them.''
Deforestation, settlement, and road-building in nearby areas have also
been blamed for decreasing the land's absorbency.
''This is not just a Dutch problem, it's a European governmental
problem,'' Environment Minister Margaretha de Boer said on Dutch radio.
''We have in places lost the absorbent effect of the land so the water
comes far quicker to us.''

TWO sisters described as Britain's most wanted pensioners were
yesterday holed up in a cottage after a three-year police search finally
caught up with them.
Mrs Winifred Bristow, 76, and Mrs Joan Payne, 74, refused to show
their faces and shouted to reporters through the letterbox: ''We've
nothing to say.''
The two had been the subject of a bizarre hunt since they disappeared
from their home in East Grinstead, West Sussex, in May 1992, after
telling relatives they were taking a short holiday.
They were finally tracked down yesterday to a rented holiday cottage
in the Suffolk village of Hessett, near Bury St Edmunds, when their car
was spotted by a neighbour.
The two grandmothers were immediately questioned by detectives, but
remained in the two-bedroomed cottage.
Their friend, 51-year-old Mrs Angela Dodge, wanted for alleged fraud
and deception in several counties and in Scotland, was not at the house
when police arrived.
Detective Constable Barry Woodley, of Hampshire Police, said the
sisters had been ''dumped'' by Mrs Dodge.
''She has ditched them and gone off with her daughter Kate. She will
probably go to ground and, without the old ladies in tow, she will be
very difficult to find,'' he said.
''The old ladies are not being particularly co-operative, but they
said she got a bus to Cambridge last Thursday.
''I think things were getting a bit too hot for her so she decided to
go it alone. We have no plans to charge the elderly ladies.''

Tiel, Tuesday
MORE than 250,000 Dutch today had either abandoned their low-lying
homes or were under instruction to do so in their country's biggest
civilian evacuation since 1953.
The disaster, building for more than a week and putting dire pressure
on the Netherlands vast system of river dikes and sea defences, today
claimed its first Dutch life.
Dutch television said two people were pulled from the River Waal at
the village of Winssen, and one of them died. The other was taken to
hospital in a serious condition.
Authorities recommended today that about 140,000 more people be
evacuated, joining more than 100,000 who have fled since the weekend.
Many of those who received advisories were around Nijmegen on the
River Waal near the point just inside the Dutch-German border where the
Rhine splits into the Waal and the Rhine on the final stage to the North
Sea.
''The situation is not so threatening that people must leave
immediately but they must be gone by Thursday morning,'' Jan Terlouw,
Queen's Commissioner for stricken Gelderland province, told a news
conference.
Huge areas have been declared ''no-go zones'' by authorities worried
that they may be suddenly inundated if dike walls burst.
Inhabitants of Tiel, about 45 miles south-east of Amsterdam where the
Amsterdam-Rhine Canal meets the Waal, and nearby Culemborg face forcible
evacuation if they have not left by Thursday. Both communities are west
of Nijmegen.
A national disaster fund was opened for citizen donations to help
flood victims. The Government said it had no immediate plans to announce
emergency laws.
About half the Netherlands is below sea-level, but the areas most
affected -- near Maastricht in the south through the Maas (Meuse) and
Rhine valleys near Nijmegen -- were at risk from rivers swollen by
melting snow and heavy rain in France, Germany and Belgium.
''If those dikes break, things happen very suddenly. The water pours
in,'' a spokesman for the Transport and Waterworks Ministry said. ''We
advise people not to settle there -- but if they want to, that's up to
them.''
Transport Minister Annemarie Jorritsma urged people to keep calm but
urged those who could help to do so. ''There is no reason for panic, but
everyone who can help, should,'' she told reporters.
Hordes of people took to the roads, causing traffic jams as they
loaded possessions and furniture on to cars, coaches, trucks, caravans,
tractors, trailers and bicycles. Shops and businesses rushed to remove
what goods they could to safety.
Prime Minister Wim Kok, speaking to parliament in The Hague in a
televised address, expressed profound sympathy for those affected and
said Queen Beatrix would visit flooded areas tomorrow and Thursday.
''We live hour by hour with the fears, worries and emotions of tens of
thousands of citizens,'' Kok said. ''People are leaving their homes and
possessions without knowing how and when they will get back to them.''
At Lobith, where the Rhine enters the Netherlands from Germany, the
water level rose to 54ft 7in above sea level by this evening, above the
crest of 53ft 9in during floods in Christmas 1993.
It was forecast to peak at 54ft 11in tomorrow.
''The dikes at the moment are in a good condition, but there is a
chance they will become saturated which over time could pose a risk,''
said a spokeswoman at the Arnhem-based regional crisis centre.
It was the Netherlands' largest civilian evacuation since massive
flooding in 1953 when more than 1800 people perished after sea walls
collapsed in the south of the country.
The Dutch Government, desperate to avoid a repetition of those great
floods, promised action soon to prevent a recurrence of the catastrophe.
The south and east were hit by heavy flooding just 13 months ago.
''We must . . . speedily address the structural problems,'' Kok said.
''The Netherlands has a long history and a great reputation for its
defences against the sea. Now the danger from the rivers seems greater
than many had thought.''--Reuter.

A SNACK bar proprietor has been fined #750 for failing to carry out
improvements to his take-away premises in Paisley. Alistair Morris, of
Clare's Place, Neilston Road, pled guilty at Paisley Sheriff Court to
contraventions of the Food Safety Act. The court heard how environmental
health officers from Renfrew District Council visited the premises and
issued a notice requiring Morris to upgrade a ventilation system and
improve washing facilities. Despite warnings, he failed to carry out the
work within the time allowed. Sheriff Rita Rae ordered the accused to
pay the fine by instalments of #20 a week.

Algiers, Tuesday
THE death toll from the suicide bombing of Algiers police headquarters
rose to 42 today as President Liamine Zeroual pledged to ''exterminate
the monsters'' behind it.
Another 286 people, many of them children, were injured in yesterday's
attack. Before visiting the wounded, the president said: ''The whole
world knows that the Algerian people and state will not yield before
barbarism.
''This type of operation gives us more strength and effectiveness in
pursuing our struggle against these monsters until they are
exterminated.''
Reports today said a suicide bomber driving a stolen white Fiat packed
with more than 200lb of TNT had carried out the bombing, the deadliest
attack in three years of civil war in which some 30,000 people have
died.
The driver was a ''terrorist kamikaze'' who drove straight into the
building, local newspapers said.
The government blamed militants fighting to establish a hardline
Islamic state. Prime Minister Mokdad Sifi said the militants would kill
anyone who stood in their way.
Violence erupted after Algeria's rulers cancelled a General Election
in January 1992 which the now-outlawed Islamic Salvation Front was
poised to win.--Reuter.

Some refugees said the emperor was being used to deflect anger with
the Government's response to the January 17 disaster, which has been
heavily criticised.
''The emperor should use his head,'' said a shopkeeper who lost one of
her two stores. ''He's being used by politicians and isn't going to
accomplish anything by coming here.''
However other refugees were thrilled by his encouragement. ''The
emperor is still very important in Japan and his visit here today is
giving some people the spirit to continue and rebuild their lives,''
said 28-year-old construction worker Haruo Akira.--Reuter.

A report by the Advisory Committee on Pesticides has led to action by

residues found in some carrots after the use of organophosphorus
preparations to control carrot fly.
Residues were found to be generally below permitted maximum levels but
it was found that there could be wide variations between individual
carrots -- even among those taken from the same row.
Discussions are to be held with the agrochemical manufacturers and
with growers to identify ways of minimising residues. These could
include limiting the number of applications to three per year and
continued monitoring of both home produced and imported carrots.

LABOUR MP Tam Dalyell today will challenge Foreign Secretary Douglas
Hurd with a list of unanswered questions about the Lockerbie bombing in
what will be the first direct confrontation with the Government over new
evidence in the case.
He will ask Mr Hurd to account for a growing list of discrepancies --
which Lockerbie campaigners claim cast serious doubts on the
Government's case against two Libyans, who are wanted in connection with
the crime which killed 270 people in 1988.
The Linlithgow MP believes pressure for the Government to accept new
evidence in the case is irresistible, and believes pressure for a
reversal is coming from Tory back benchers:
''Quite a number of Conservative back benchers are acutely
uncomfortable about the Government's position,'' he said.
Mr Dalyell's questions detail information which has come to light in
the years since the American and British governments announced the
bombing was the work of Libyan intelligence and issued warrants for the
arrest of two men, who remain in Libya.
Relatives of the victims and others, including Mr Dalyell, reject the
Government's case and claim the attack was the work of Palestinian
terrorists working on behalf of Iran.
They also argue that American intelligence is guilty of complicity in
the attack for allowing the bomb on board the plane in Frankfurt,
thinking it was part of an undercover drug surveillance operation.
Mr Dalyell has notified Mr Hurd of the questions he plans to ask. All
cast doubt on the official version of events. In particular, he will
confront Mr Hurd with the recent publication of an American intelligence
document which claims the bombing was ordered by Iranian extremists for
a reward of $10m.
He will also ask Mr Hurd to account for the presence of American
officials at the scene of the crash in the hours after PanAm flight 103
was blown out of the sky over Lockerbie, and if drugs purporting to be
part of an American intelligence operation were found in the wreckage.
Families of some of the Lockerbie victims will be present in the
Commons gallery for the brief debate.
Mr Dalyell will say: ''Do the prosecuting authorites regard themselves
as being free now to close their eyes to any new leads, and decline to
investigate any potential evidence, which runs counter to the
allegations? Do they really assert that the sole responsibility for
investigating any such evidence rests on those entrusted with the task
of representing the relatives, if and when a trial takes place?''
''And ending with the relatives, six long years later, they want to
know exactly why US personnel were withdrawn from the flight, and
exactly what officials of the US government knew. This was not made
available to the youngsters going to their deaths.''

<HEADLINE>Scottish farming income shows 31% rise to #381m</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SCOTTISH farming income is estimated to have risen by 31% last year to
#381m -- an increase described by Scottish Office Agriculture Minister
Sir Hector Monro as ''further clear evidence of growing confidence in
the agriculture sector''.
A major factor in the improved position was a dramatic increase in the
potato sector with an estimated income of #117m, double the 1993 figure
with little or no change to acreage planted or yields. Figures for
oilseed rape were #61m compared to #46m last year and #35m in 1992.
Acreage planted, yields and prices all showed increases.
Cropping revenues generally showed considerable increases and
livestock and livestock product revenues were marginally up compared
with 1993. Total direct subsidy payments rose from #296m to #332m.
Both farming income and ''total income from farming'' (which includes
payments totalling #73m made to farmers and their families) are shown,
in real terms, to be the highest in the last decade. Total income from
farming is estimated at #454m -- an increase of 25%.
In UK terms, farm incomes rose by 4.4% last year, illustrating a much
less volatile scenario once figures for the much more broadly-based
industry south of the Border is taken into account.
Scottish farming income was #166m in 1992. It rose to #291m in 1993
and, according to yesterday's forecasts from the Scottish Office, will
reach #381m for 1994. Livestock farms in the less-favoured areas are
expected, however, to show reduced incomes and it is the improved 1994
harvest and the significant increase in potato prices which account for
the susbstantial increase.
According to the farm accounts survey, covering 600 farms, the big
earners for 1994-95 are in general cropping, dairying and mixed farming,
with estimated average net farm incomes in these sectors of #64,059,
#31,778 and #20,214 respectively.
At the other end of the scale were specialist sheep farmers in
less-favoured areas with projected incomes of #8422 -- a decrease of
24%. Decreases of 3% are forecast for LFA specialist beef farmers, whose
incomes are expected to average #12,591 and LFA cattle and sheep farmers
at #14,837.
Cereal outputs, including area compensation payments, are estimated to
have risen by #24m (10%) and the value of oilseed rape is estimated to
be up by #15m (33%). On the livestock front the value of finished cattle
output is estimated to have risen by #29m (6%).
Increased prices for clean sheep were offset by lower prices for ewes
and rams with the result expected to be a fall of #14m (5%) in the value
of the output. A higher level of marketings from a larger pig population
outweighed lower prices to give a small increase of #4m (5%) in the
estimated value of pigmeat output.
The importance of subsidies is highlighted in the case of farmers in
the less-favoured areas. The projected #8422 income figure for
specialist sheep producers is achieved only with a subsidy payment of
#21,000. For LFA specialist beef operators the subsidy was #17,295 and
for combined cattle and sheep farms the figure was #26,000.
In other sectors the average subsidy figures are estimated at #24,400
for general cropping; #5500 for dairying; #22,500 for cereals; #20,900
for mixed cattle.
Mr John Ross, president of the National Farmers' Union of Scotland,
described the Scottish Office income figures as ''excellent news''. In
most sectors there was a mood of confidence.An estimated #176m in
capital investments had been ploughed back into farm businesses last
year which was good for Scotland's economy and would help to secure jobs
in the countryside.

A LIGHT and airy room with its own distinctive character, a
conservatory makes a spectacular living room or dining room. Specialist
companies designing and building conservatories to suit modern homes and
lifestyles can combine the advantages of a summer house with the comfort
of a conventional room in summer and winter.
Conservatories became very fashionable in the late nineteenth century.
They were mass produced from wood or cast-iron and could be bought
through mail order catalogues.
Modern double glazed panels can provide as much insulation as a brick
wall, creating a comfortable living space while providing an ideal
environment in which to grow and show exotic plants. Some specialist
firms can design and build fully insulated conservatories with walls and
floors which prevent heat loss, and tiled or slated roofs, so there's no
noise on rainy days.
The modern conservatory has all the benefits of a normal apartment,
and can be used all year round. In addition, the homeowner has a
particularly attractive extension which adds to the appeal of the
exterior of the home, which is light and airy in summer, and which makes
the most of sunshine and warmth throughout the coldest months of the
year.
In recent years the popularity of conservatories attached to the house
has soared. Adding a conservatory is one of the easiest and most
economical methods of home extension, and modern conservatories are so
versatile. A place to relax, a bright and stimulating work room,
somewhere for the kids to play on dull days, and a spectacular setting
where you can welcome and entertain guests. Today's custom-built
conservatories are virtually maintenance-free and will bring warmth and
light to your living space, making a delightful and practical addition
to any design of home.
Some styles are based on the restrained good looks of the traditional
Edwardian designs, with an elegant simplicity which looks well with many
types of modern homes. The ornate and charming Victorian-style
conservatories which are built with the benefits of modern materials and
technology have delicate good looks which disguise hard-wearing
practicality. From the comfort of a modern conservatory extension you
can watch the seasons come and go, enjoy the winter scenery after heavy
snow, see the first signs of spring, enjoy the late autumn sunshine, and
shelter from summer storms.
In the mid-nineteenth century, many mansion houses had large
conservatories to cultivate and show off exotic plant collections, and
to provide the out-of-season fruit and vegetables so highly prized at a
time when there were no freezers.
By the late nineteenth century, conservatories had become very
fashionable, and were considered an essential part of everyday life by
well-heeled Victorians. Winter gardens were built in public parks to
house tropical palms, desert cacti and succulents and displays of
brilliantly coloured camellias and rare scented orchids. The First and
Second World Wars saw a decline in large privately owned glasshouses and
conservatories, due to a shortage of material for their construction and
maintenance, and a lack of fuel to heat them.
Mass produced greenhouses became widely available in the 1950s, and
were snapped up by keen gardeners anxious to get vegetables off to a
flying start in spring, and by homeowners who wanted to cultivate
decorative plants and cut flowers for the house. Now the conservatory is
enjoying a resurgence in popularity unprecedented since Victorian times,
as advances in building design and materials bring the practical
advantages of owning a conservatory in line with modern living.
Lifestyle changes mean more demand is made on the space and resources
in our homes -- the home is now our principal place of leisure, and
specialist professional firms can build a conservatory which will double
as a new dining room, lounge, playroom, or home office. Choose a
reputable firm with a track record of creating well designed,
imaginative, low maintenance conservatories, and your new room will be
practical and versatile.
A conservatory can dramatically improve the value and appearance of
your home, and give pleasure to every member of the family. Most banks
and building societies will lend the cash required for extending and
improving your home, and specialist companies can construct
conservatories which match and enhance the architecture and appearance
of any house.
The modern conservatory has all the benefits of a normal apartment,
and can be used all year round.

From Carluke to the land of belted earls for Brooks
ONE of the most radical career moves in the world of the club
professional golfer for some time will take Andrew Brooks, aged 48, and
the incumbent for almost 17 years, from the modest environs of Carluke
to Royal St George's, which apparently likes to think of itself as The
Royal and Ancient Golf Club of England.
So why this culture-shock removal from Lanarkshire to Kent relatively
late in life by one who was born and raised in the town where his family
has an established business of drapers and house furnishing shops, with
which, however, Brooks is not directly connected? The answer came: ''I
wanted to be stretched a bit more.''
''I was always planning to look around for a better sort of job,''
Brooks explained. ''My daughter's married now, the club has just
celebrated its centenary year, and I felt I'd been here long enough. But
it's come as a real surprise to get a job at the top like this one.
''I've long been friends with Niall Cameron, the present professional
at St George's,'' Brooks added, ''and when he received the offer of an
amazing job in the Bahamas he persuaded me, after a half-hour telephone
conversation, to go for it.'' Brooks did and won the appointment from 90
other applicants.
Thus Brooks maintains a strong Scottish connection with his new club,
where he will start work no later than June. The driving force behind
its foundation in 1887 was the ex-patriot Dr Laidlaw Purves, golfer and
eye specialist, who ''spied the land with a golfer's eye'' from the roof
of a church tower in Sandwich.
The club steward and stewardess are both from Kirkcaldy and one of the
leading greenkeeping staff members also is from Scotland. When Brooks
moves with his wife and son Michael to the house provided for them they
will not lack for familiar accents.
Brooks had a lengthy competitive career.As an amateur, he played for
Scotland at boys, youths and senior level, culminating in selection for
the 1969 Walker Cup match against the United States in Milwaukee, where
he won two-and-a-half points out of three.
Then he turned pro and played on the African and European circuits
from 1970 to 1977, gaining numerous top five and top 10 placings. In
Scotland he won the old Skol tournament at Williamwood and many pro-ams.
His all-round experience qualifies him to comment on the contemporary
Scottish scene.
Brooks noted: ''There are so many good young players around -- Euan
McIntosh, John Wither, and Craig Ronald, for example. In my day
professionals used to be criticised for playing in so many pro-ams that
they weren't hungry enough for the bigger tournaments.
''Now, they've become a genuine breeding ground for the aspiring
tournament professionals. But for some reason, although they play well
locally, the Tour school kills Scots. Perhaps it's the pressure, perhaps
it's held so late in the year as it's been several weeks since we
stopped playing. Perhaps it's because it is held abroad.''
The club professionals, Brooks believes, have one over-riding problem
-- competition from the High Street. ''We are struggling to retain the
loyalty of members we once took for granted,'' he said.
Brooks continued: ''In summer, 185 members will play in the Carluke
Saturday medals, but by October the number is down to 40. They just
disappear until the following Spring when they turn up again, often with
new equipment bought elsewhere. Last December, usually the busiest
trading month, my turnover was down by 50%.''
Brooks will be catering for a very different membership -- stiff with
belted earls, retired military officers, and ''somethings in the city.''
That he survived a two-hour interview with six of them suggests an
immediate rapport.
''The members generally will be older than I'm used to,'' Brooks
concluded. ''But I'm expecting to spend much of my time playing golf
with them and I'm taking over a great shop from Niall with its stock and
fittings.'' This Anglo-Scottish combination of saintly names seems about
to form a compatible alliance.

Ross Finlay road tests the prestigious Lexus LS400
MOST kinds of ''best car'' awards are things I regard with suspicion,
after trying one Italian prize-winner which was the only vehicle I have
ever had to pull over to the kerb while feeling car-sick as the driver.
It is a different matter when the people whose opinions are canvassed
are the ones who actually bought a car, and now have to live with it.
J.D. Power and Associates runs a highly regarded ''initial quality
survey'' which involves quizzing owners of every production car model
sold on the US market. In 1990, its first full year on sale, the Lexus
LS400 took first place on the J.D. Power list, and it has remained there
ever since.
Lexus is an artificial make, although you gain no bonus points from
Toyota, which brought it into being, for saying so. Its function is to
demonstrate that Toyota -- of which Lexus is officially a division --
has design abilities well above the general run of mass-market Corollas
and the like.
Just what colossal amount of investment was poured into the Lexus
design project, with its 24 separate engineering teams, is probably
impenetrably hidden in Toyota's general accounts. But it has certainly
paid off, at least in prestige on the target US market, where the Lexus
easily outsells its great rivals from Stuttgart and Munich.
There is a much bigger range of Lexus models in the US than Toyota GB
imports here. We have the recently revised LS400 and the smaller GS300.
The new LS400 costs #44,475 and, on a first drive, seems to offer even
higher standards of refinement than before.
Front-end styling is feeble. The Lexus has no individual ''presence''
like its luxury car rivals from Stuttgart, Munich and Coventry. On the
other hand, panel fit, paintwork and general body finish are excellent.
Lengthening the wheelbase and easing out some extra interior width has
made the new model roomier. Rear-seat space is almost limousine-like,
although there is the inevitable trade-off that luggage volume is not as
lavish as you might expect.
The four-litre, four-cam V8 engine redefines refinement. This is
simply one of the smoothest 260bhp power units on the market, and there
is nothing close to the Lexus's probably subsidised price which really
approaches it. With the standard automatic box the LS400 wafts to 60mph
in under seven seconds, and should nudge a test track 155mph. The torque
spread, for response and power across the speed range, is even more
impressive than before.
The transmission provides lovely slurred changes. I liked the fact
that the P-R-N-D positions are on a different line from the 3-2-1 slots.
If you want to slip the car into 3 to avoid a change up into top, you
simply touch the lever sideways.
Ride quality is top class, and the suspension has been modified a
little to help high-speed handling. Suspicions that there must be a
loss-leader element somewhere in the Lexus pricing system are redoubled
when you examine the mind-boggling list of standard -- not
optional-extra -- items, which include a majestic audio system. Similar
specification tables for its German rivals are almost laughably higher
priced.
Mechanical noise levels are at an absolute minimum. I admire the Lexus
engineers for improving the car while reducing its weight. The very low
Cd figure is the result of painstaking attention to the aerodynamics.

MARK Dwyer is to appeal against the ban he received at Fairyhouse.
The jockey was suspended for two days, starting next Monday, after
having been adjudged guilty of using his whip ''with excessive
frequency'' on Nuns Royal in a hurdle race on Sunday.
Dwyer said: ''I felt I was a little hard done by and I think I have
got a fair chance of getting the ban overturned.''
If Dwyer loses his appeal, he will miss the ride on Arkle Chase

FOLLOWING his joint fourth-place finish in the Johnnie Walker Classic,
Andrew Coltart confirmed from Manila that he will defend his title at
Dalmahoy in the Tartan Special Scottish Professional championship.
He has opted to miss the Spanish Open, the clashing European Tour
event on May 18 to 21, believing the Scottish tournament is being held
at a good time for his schedule. ''By that time I'll have played in more
than a dozen European Tour events, and it's good to get home for a week
or two every now and then,'' he said.
Coltart won last year at the same venue in a play-off against Gary

<TEXT>
ANOTHER sighting of a puma-like animal has been reported to police in
the Highlands.
The latest report was of a black jaguar or puma bounding across the
A82 Inverness to Fort William road, three miles north of Fort Augustus.
The animal was spotted by delivery driver Colin Mackay, 51, of
Tenafelle, Muir of Ord. He said yesterday: ''It gave me quite a shock. I
was driving my lorry about dawn when I saw this large dark-coloured
animal leap out from the bushes on the loch-side of the road, about 100
yards ahead of me.
''It didn't stop and just bounded across the road before disappearing
into the forest. I slowed down to have a look but it was gone.''
Mr Mackay is sure it was a large cat. He added: ''I have been driving
in the Highlands for 12 years and have seen a lot of things on the road,
including large dogs, deer and the like. But never anything like this.
''It was so unusual, I thought I had better report it to the police. I
have read the newspaper reports about other similar animals being seen
in other areas and thought it best to let the authorities know that I
had seen something similar in the Fort Augustus area.''
On several occasions last month, a similar animal was spotted in the
Huntly area and mutilated animal carcasses have been found.
In the 70s and early 80s, there were frequent sightings of similar
cat-like beasts throughout the Highlands, as well as skeletons of deer
and sheep, stripped of their hide and meat.
However, only one was ever caught, and it was caged at the Kincraig
Wildlife Park until it died eight years ago.
A Northern Constabulary spokesman said: ''The Forestry Commission in
that area has been informed of this sighting and the force's Animal
Wildlife Liaison Officer, PC Ronnie Dempster, who is based in Alness,
has also been alerted.
''Although it is not clear exactly what kind of animal is involved
here, no search is planned. But we would still advise the public to be
vigilant and cautious if confronted by any such animal.''

TORMENTED Kevin Moy, 32, who threw his two-week-old son to his death
from a bridge because he thought the child was the Devil, was ordered to
be detained in the State Hospital at Carstairs yesterday after a jury
found him not guilty of murder because he was insane at the time.
The High Court in Glasgow heard how Moy came to believe he was the
anti-Christ and that his son was Satan.
Moy was sure the Devil had put a birthmark on the boy's head and that
he and the infant were to blame for the Gulf war.
He also feared they would destroy the world by infecting mankind with
a virus.
Later he told police he had to save the world by killing both his son
and himself. Moy was also obsessed by the number six, traditionally
linked to the Devil.
The court heard that Moy had worked as a lab technician until he
contracted ME eight years ago and suffered depression.
But there was no sign of the tragedy to follow when he visited his
wife Eileen and son, born last September 26, in hospital.
She returned home with the baby, but Moy stayed with his parents
because he needed care for his depression.
But tragedy struck when Moy and his wife took Eoghan for his first
outing on a sunny day last October.
As they stood at Overtoun Bridge near a Dumbarton beauty spot, Moy
suddenly dropped the baby to the wooded banks of a burn 42ft below then
tried to throw himself over, but was dragged back by his screaming wife.
Bystanders scrambled down the steep banks, where Eoghan lay fatally
injured. He died in hospital next day.
Moy was taken to nearby Overtoun House, where he grabbed a kitchen
knife and tried to slash his wrists before he was arrested.
Mr Kevin Drummond QC, defending, told the jury: ''The tragedy of what
happened here is beyond all comprehension.'' The jury was told that it
was agreed by both the prosecution and the Crown that Moy, of Alexander
Street, Dumbarton, had dropped the baby over the bridge.
But the 11 women and four men on the jury had to decide whether they
accepted the evidence of four psychiatrists that Moy was insane at the
time of the killing. They returned a unanimous verdict.
The judge, Lord Mayfield, ordered Moy to be detained in the State
Hospital.He will remain in the hospital until doctors think he is fit to
leave, but the final decision will rest with the Scottish Secretary.
Mr Craig Scott, prosecuting, told the jury that it was not in dispute
that Moy had dropped his baby over the bridge.
What they had to decide was if they accepted the evidence of four
psychiatrists who all agreed that Moy was insane at the time and was
suffering from an acute alienation of reason, and he suggested they
would have no difficulty in reaching the same decision.
Mr Drummond said: ''Nobody is in any doubt that the accused is not a
criminal, but is a very seriously ill and sick young man.'' He said Moy
and his family were due sympathy.
He told the jury: ''This case either represents evil of such depth
that it is beyond comprehension, or alternatively it represents an
illness which is also beyond the comprehension of ordinary human
beings.'' He said that Moy was an intelligent, decent man from a good
family background, and the tragedy had deeply affected the families on
both sides.
Moy sat staring ahead with a nurse from the State Hospital sitting
nearby during the two-day hearing.

<HEADLINE>Warning on tougher job rules for ex-Ministers</HEADLINE>

<PAGE>6</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>980074661</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
TIGHTENING up the rules on what jobs Government Ministers can take
after leaving office could deter people from becoming MPs, the Nolan
Inquiry into standards in public life heard yesterday.
Leader of the Commons Tony Newton also said that Ministers needed to
know that they could support their families in the aftermath of losing a
Government job.
He was concerned at the suggestion that ex-Ministers should face
tougher restrictions on jobs they could take, possibly along the lines
of rules for retiring civil servants.
Unlike a career in the Civil Service, politics was an ''inherently
insecure'' way of life, and Ministers could find themselves out of
office and perhaps out of Parliament at very short notice, he said.
Asked about the possibility of an outside official ruling on the
behaviour of individual MPs -- to tackle criticism that MPs act as
prosecutor, judge and jury in their own cases -- Mr Newton said the idea
would meet ''some sensitivity''.

THE Scottish Labour Party conference at Inverness next month is being
offered the opportunity to take a decision which could have a decisive
impact on Mr Tony Blair's controversial bid to reform Labour's
constitution.
Cunninghame North Labour Party has submitted an amendment which will
ask the party to give its support to the alternative to Clause 4
composed by its MP, Mr Brian Wilson, a Commons Trade and Industry
spokesman.
In doing so, it offers delegates a specific form of words along the
lines that Mr Blair is thinking.
This remedies what Blair supporters have admitted has been a grievous
weakness in their campaign so far -- the lack of an alternative to the
existing historic clause for which to argue.
Mr Wilson, who penned his version on a London-to-Glasgow sleeper,
restricted himself to exactly the same number of words -- 55 -- as the
original. He has found his effort welcomed by a wide range of MPs and
others in the party.
He said yesterday ''An extraordinary range of people have expressed
approval, including some who might not have done so if you'd put them in
the same room.''
Mr Blair's team of advisers has agreed that Mr Wilson's form of words
is skilful, one described it as ''excellent'', and will be watching
closely to see how it goes down with the conference.
One admirer said that the Wilson version catches the same tone of high
aspiration as the 1918 clause and avoids the bureacratic and uninspiring
rewrite which some reform supporters fear could be the result of a
committee composition.
It could form a model or even be adopted by Labour's national
executive committee, which meets the week after the Scottish conference
to agree the definitive replacement version on which the party will vote
at a special conference in April.
Mr Blair's standing as leader will be powerfully affected by whether
the party accepts or rejects his initiative to modernise the party's
aims.
The Scottish conference was thought at one time to be unpromising
ground for the reformers but Blair supporters believe the case for
change has made progress, will make more in the six weeks before the
vote and that they will beat off those calling for the old Clause 4 to
stay.
Selection and compositing of motions and amendments is for the
conference business committee but it looks likely that it will seek to
give delegates a straight choice between keeping Clause 4 and a specific
alternative for which the Cunninghame amendment seems to fit the bill.
Clause 4, approved in 1918, reads: ''To secure for thr workers by hand
or by brain the full fruits of their industry and the most equitable
distribution thereof that may be possible upon the basis of the common
ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange, and the
best obtainable system of popular administration and control of each
industry or service.''
Mr Wilson's alternative reads: ''To enhance the birthright of every
citizen to fulfil his or her potential consistent with social justice
and the equitable distribution of wealth; to cast out poverty, nurture
enterprise and promote common ownership; cherish and advance democracy;
all in order to bequeath to the next generation a better world than the
one we inherited.''
Alternative offered for 1995
* Mr Wilson's alternative -- penned on a London-to-Glasgow sleeper --
reads:
''To enhance the birthright of every citizen to fulfil his or her
potential consistent with social justice and the equitable distribution
of wealth; to cast out poverty, nurture enterprise and promote common
ownership; cherish and advance democracy; all in order to bequeath to
the next generation a better world than the one we inherited.''

GO Hever Golf should not be opposed today in the Parsley Handicap over
six furlongs at Wolverhampton.
Gary Carter's mount was a failure on turf last season and even
finished plum last when tried in blinkers on his final appearance. But
he has been a revelation since switching to the all-weather surface.
Ridden from the front in a six-furlong maiden at Lingfield last month,
he was never remotely in danger and sauntered home eight lengths clear.
Similar tactics brought an equally facile success in a nursery on the
same course a week later.
Though he was hard pressed to complete the hat trick at Southwell last
time out, there is no reason to think that his winning run has come to
an end.
A switch to five furlongs on going officially described as slow seemed
to catch him out and the gelding had to be pushed out fairly vigourously
to assert close home.
Trainer Joe Naughton returns Go Hever Golf to a more suitable trip
today and looks to have found a perfect opportunity for the
much-improved three-year-old to land a valuable prize.
Northern Celadon should also be in the money in the Rosemary Handicap.
The four-year-old looks a bargain at the 5200 guineas Mikey Heaton-Ellis
paid to buy him out of Michael Jarvis' stable at Newmarket in the
autumn.
He raced with plenty of zest when scorching home in a claimer on this
course on New Year's Eve, and he ran a fine third to the in-form South
Eastern Fred in a very competitive race by Wolverhampton standards three
weeks ago.
The handicapper has seen fit to drop Northern Celadon 2lb for that
latest effort and he can take full advantage in what looks a less
strongly-contested affair.
Philgun can land the opening Thyme Handicap. He was having his first
outing for two months when third to Hillzah here a fortnight ago and ran
as though he would improve a good deal for the race.
Bill Elsey will have the six-year-old fully primed this time and he
can pay the expenses for the journey down from Malton with a win.
* TWO more meetings were lost to waterlogging yesterday morning as
racing continues to be hit by the wet weather.
Nottingham had been the scene of determined efforts to beat the
elements as ground staff battled literally manned the pumps, but
overnight rain forced an early abandonment.
Today's fixture at Leicester quickly followed, also because of
waterlogging.

St Johnstone 1,
Stenhousemuir 1
EIGHT years to the day after Adrian Sprott claimed his place in the
record books by scoring the goal which gave Hamilton a momentous
Scottish Cup victory against Rangers, he again showed his sense of the
theatrical.
With the tie against St Johnstone two minutes into injury time, the
veteran midfielder struck the equaliser direct from a corner kick to
earn a replay for Stenhousemuir.
Perth keeper Alan Main will have a sleepless night about the loss of
the goal, but it was no more than the second division side deserved.
The replay is at Ochilview on February 7, and having extended their
unbeaten run to 17 games at McDiarmid Park, the second division leaders
will be confident about reaching the last l6 and a lucrative tie with
Aberdeen.
Sprott, beaming with delight, said: ''That is the first time in 14
years that I have managed to score with a corner. Yes, it was special
because I knew time was almost up. This is something, though, that we
practice in training.
''But nothing will can compare with that goal against Rangers which
will live in the memory forever.''
Stenhousemuir's challenge seemed to have ended in disappointment after
defender John McNiven conceded an own goal seconds before the interval.
A cross from Northern Ireland striker George O'Boyle caused the
problems, and when youngster Kevin Twaddle headed it on, the hapless
McNiven couldn't get out the way and turned the ball into his own net.
With the tie 12 seconds old, Stenhousemuir demonstrated their
ambition, but striker Miller Mathieson shot straight at keeper Alan
Main.
It took St Johnstone time to settle, and their first real attempt at
goal was a header from O'Boyle which lacked enough power to trouble
keeper Mike Harkness.
Then Paul Cherry needed all his experience to deny Sprott, and Gareth
Hutchison should have delivered the vital first goal on the half-hour
mark. Instead, he skied a cross from defender Euan Donaldson into Main's
arms.

Morton 1, Kilmarnock 2
After extra time. 90min: 1-1
STEVE Maskrey, a second-half substitute, shot Kilmarnock into the next
round of the Tennents Scottish Cup at Cappielow last night.
The premier division side had looked out of things at the halfway
stage, with Morton in front thanks to a John Anderson goal. However,
Maskrey replaced Derek Anderson in the second period, and midway through
the half he pushed the tie into extra time with the equaliser.
Then, with 101 minutes gone, Maskrey collected the ball from Ally
Mitchell before shooting low into the net.
The kick-off was held up for 15 minutes to allow the crowd in, and the
fans were soon being treated to good cup-tie action.
Morton's defence lived dangerously as they mis-kicked twice in
succession, then it was the Kilmarnock fans' turn to groan as a Derek
Collins drive went through the hands of keeper Dragoje Lekovic, but the
ball spun back from a leg.
The feeling was that a goal must soon come, and it duly arrived in 21
minutes, when Morton took the lead.
A Derek McInnes corner from the left was headed down by Rowan
Alexander in the crowded goalmouth, and John Anderson forced the ball
over the line.
With tempers fraying, Morton's Collins and Derek Anderson, of Killie,
were booked in separate incidents.
The second divison side were full of confidence and shortly before the
interval, Lindberg again tested keeper Lekovic.
Maskrey then replaced Anderson, Kilmarnock manager Alex Totten
obviously upset at the first-half performance of his side.
However, after 75 minutes Maskrey eased Kilmarnock back into the tie
when he collected a cross from Mark Reilly before shooting low into the
net.
Morton midfielder Alan Mahood was sent off a minute from time. He
first was booked for a foul and then, when he did not retreat the full
10 yards for the free kick, he was red-carded.
Totten was chuffed that his team reached the next round. ''Maskrey did

SHARES in James Finlay suffered yesterday when the Glasgow-based
trader and confectionery firm said a combination of droughts, bad debts
and redundancy costs would hit this year's profits.
Despite reassurances that the dividend would be maintained, the City
initially slashed 13p from the shares before calmer conditions
prevailed. The shares eventually 8p lower at 67p.
Adverse weather had caused damage in its Kenyan and Bangladeshi tea
plantations, cutting the crop yield by around 10% at a time when prices
were also stagnating.
The UK-based tea trading business suffered bad debts during a rapid
expansion into eastern Europe, including the non-payment of an uninsured
shipment to Poland worth about #500,000. The Mombasa trading division
had also struggled.
Hefty redundancy payments only added to the problems after a major
shake-up in the George Payne confectionery side -- best known for its
Poppets brand -- and the shrinkage of Finlay's merchant banking arm.
Around 50 people were made redundant overall.
''Having closed the oil and gas operations and slimmed down the
confectionery and banking sides, further progress has been achieved in
concentrating our business activities,'' chairman Richard Muir said.
The company, which diversified in the 1970s on the back of high tea
prices, largely failed to make profits outside its core interests and
the retrenchment in the past decade has been painful.
More than #3.5m of the bank's property-related debts alone had to be
written off before the decision was made last year to wind down the
operation.
Last September, Finlay reported relatively strong half-year results
with pre-tax profits up by almost one-third to #4.9m. Analysts had
spoken of some #13m in full-year profits, a figure that now looks highly
optimistic.
The company gave no indication of what it expected for the year-end
though a figure nearer #8m is probably a far more realistic projection.
''We feel the worst is past and our confidence about the dividend
payment is solidly based,'' Mr Muir added. ''Marketing of the
confectionery side has been put on a more down-to-earth basis and tea
prices are stabilising.''
The Paynes confectionery and beverage business, which makes up about
10% of the group total, increased operating profit from #1.1m to #1.7m.

LARGE holdings in troubled stock market debutants took their toll on
Edinburgh Small Companies Trust, with gearing aggravating its
underperformance against the benchmark index.
Net asset value fell 8.6% to 94.1p during the six months to
end-December, compared with a decline of only 4.9% in the Extended Hoare
Govett Smaller Companies Index.
With a dramatic collapse in the share prices of newcomers
Aerostructures Hamble and support services group DRS, its two largest
holdings at the beginning of the period, are no longer significant.
However, although remaining cautious about the impact of US interest
rate concerns on bond and equity markets, the #65.4m investment trust,
launched in the autumn of 1993 as EFM Small Companies Trust, remains
optimistic.
Director Alex Gowans believes a prospective price-earnings multiple of
12.5 and a yield of about 4.6% on the FTSE All-Share index represent
good value. He sees a stock market rally initially led by blue chips but
believes there is potential for small companies ultimately to outperform
first-liners because of their earnings prospects.
Gearing, which is detrimental during periods of falling share prices,
was steady between 12% and 13% during the six-month period. However,
Edinburgh Small Companies, forecasting an eventual upturn in prices,
hopes ultimately to increase it to the 20% level seen during the first
half of the calendar year.

NORTH Sea oil production rose by almost a quarter in 1994 to its
highest level for eight years with the December total of 2.71 million
barrels per day approaching the all-time monthly output record.
The latest Royal Bank of Scotland Oil and Gas Index showed last year's
average total of 2.5 million bpd was the best since 1986 and that
combined oil and gas revenues of #37m a day were the highest in 10 years
despite weak oil prices.
''On average, oil and gas revenues rose by 11% over 1993, but North
Sea oil companies may be slightly disappointed with this return given
the rise of nearly 25% in oil output,'' Mark Shea, the Royal's chief
energy economist, said yesterday.
December's average oil output rose by just over 2% from November's
total to 2.71 million bpd, the highest since March 1986 and close to the
all-time record of 2.82 million achieved in January 1985.
Revenue over the year would have been far higher but for the
relatively poor average price of $15.91 for benchmark Brent crude -- a
7% fall from 1993 and the lowest annual level since 1988.
In addition, the fall was magnified for Britain by currency changes
which resulted in a 9% fall in the sterling price to just over #10.30.
Prices were lowest in the first quarter at under #10 per barrel.
''North Sea production shows strong underlying growth, and gas output
would have been far higher but for the exceptionally mild autumn weather
which restricted demand for heating fuel,'' Mr Shea added.
More affected by seasonal factors, gas production nonetheless rose by
2% over the year to an average of almost 6500 million cu ft per day and
the December total showed a 16% increase to 8000 million as winter
finally began to take grip.
Clement weather, technological advances and the arrival of 10 new
fields on stream all contributed to the increase in output which was
achieved despite an estimated 18% fall in capital investment in the
industry.
Given the high production base which has been established despite the
relatively low world prices and less accessible North Sea fields,
further substantial growth looks more difficult.
''But there are reasons for cautious optimism, many of them stemming
from the success of the industry's cost-reduction programme,'' Mr Shea
said.
In fact, Government estimates of investment intentions for 1995 show a
23% increase over last year, illustrating the commitment of North Sea
operators who have recently been criticised by Opec producers for
depressing prices through over-production.
Pressure from the Middle East on North Sea producers -- Norway is the
other big player -- is unlikely to have much effect, according to UK oil
industry analysts who point out that Opec countries have seldom paid
much attention to European lobbying in the past.

A STARK warning by Sidlaw Group chairman Michael Walker that
difficulties in recovering cost increases will result in first-half
profits in the packaging division being ''significantly'' below those of
the same period last year (#5.5m) pushed the shares down 25p to 173p
yesterday. That wiped #16m off the Dundee-registered company's market
capitalisation to #119m.
The shares are below the 180p at which the #24m rights issue was
launched last October to help finance European expansion in a two-year
programme.
Mr Walker told the annual meeting in Edinburgh that Sidlaw, in common
with other packaging companies, had experienced both price deflation and
steep rises in raw material prices. Polymer resin and polypropylene film
prices have risen by 30% and 50% respectively since September and
although there has been a good level of success in passing them on,
there has been a lag in recovering them in selling prices.
Chief executive Digby Morrow said competitor companies such as Crest
Packaging had made similar complaints about price increases last week.
He added that top executives should be looking at how companies are
positioned because there is increased rationalisation of suppliers by
the big food manufacturers for flexible packaging.
The packaging division has a strong order book and there are
indications that the rate of price increases is slowing, which with cost
reductions, is expected to lead to recovery in the second half.
Last year, Sidlaw, which also has oil services as a core activity as
well as its original jute textile operation which are up for sale,
achieved pre-tax profits of #14.6m.

MR MAJOR, in a heated moment, accused Mr Blair of ''spreading scare
services''. As they were discussing or, rather, shouting at each other
about rail privatisation it might even have counted as a Freudian slip.
The question is not ''Would you buy a second-hand railway from this
Government?'' because we know someone will, but ''What kind of a ride
will the travelling public be taken for?''
Mr Blair insists that there will be fewer rides going, pointing to the
fact that the minimum service new operators will be required to provide
will often be less than the much-maligned British Rail provides.
Ah, said Mr Major, but the minimum guarantees offered now are the
first-ever offered, and the future potential operators have said they
will provide more than the minimum.
Mr Blair did not quite succeed in being boring about this, but he came
close. As the railways are one of the few public services he has
actually come out and said with socialist conviction should remain
public, he is bound to harp on its future. Ministers hope to have fun
later seeing whether he will or won't offer to renationalise the bits
they manage to sell off before the next election.
Mr Major seemed to be in a happy mood, having reduced the Cabinet
Europhiles to aquiescence in the pragmatic scepticism towards Europe
which he believes offers the Tories the best chance of holding together
until the election.
However, if Mr Blair did not bother him much, wily old Mr Peter Shore
bowled him a wobbly, suggesting that Mr Jacques Santer, far from being
-- in words the Prime Minister must now regret using -- ''the right man
in the right place at the right time'', was exactly the opposite.
It would be ''extremely difficult'' to find a Commission president who
was not in favour of a single currency or reducing the voting powers of
the larger member states, conceded Mr Major, causing some dismayed looks
behind him.
However, he added, Mr Santer had gone on to support various objectives
like completion of the single market and stronger foreign and security
policies which were British priorities. Mr Santer, who seems to be a
flexible, if not pliable, politician has probably taken care to call for
a few things that each member government wants.
Mr Major was at his cheekiest, though, on education when he announced
that Labour's plans would cause ''chaos''. As many teachers, parents and
pupils feel that chaos is exactly what the Government has been visiting
on the system, pausing now perhaps as much out of exhaustion as
conviction, this was a bit rich.
Such is Cabinet unity these days -- at least outside the Cabinet room
-- that Mr Major was even prepared to praise Mr Peter Lilley, widely
believed to be one of the Cabinet ''bastards'' Mr Major does not much
like.
Mr Lilley has actually found some foreigners attempting to take
advantage of Britannia's generous social security system and stopped
them. There were not very many and he has not saved very much, but at
least he showed they were there, which some doubters not Conservative
Party conference representatives had disputed.
Mr Major praised the Lilley initiative but temperately. The Cabinet is
being forced to huddle together by the icy wind of public disapproval.
The Europhiles are having to become ''realists''; the ''realists'' to
become ''sceptics''.
This has made Sir Edward Heath and Lord Howe very angry but one
doesn't have to be re-elected and the other probably believes he will be
whatever happens. It is not losing his Huntingdon seat that worries Mr
Major but keeping the one in the middle of the Cabinet table.

Newsprint costs may force Murdoch rethink.
AN end is in sight to the newspaper price war after News International
chairman Rupert Murdoch warned that rising newsprint prices may force up
cover prices.
Mr Murdoch told the World Economic Forum at Davos in Switzerland that
newsprint prices had gone up between 30% and 40% in the last three
months -- ''that changes the economics of newspapers'' and, as a result,
cuts to the cover prices of some of his British newspapers ''will
probably have to be corrected to some extent''.
News International uses about 460,000 tonnes of newsprint annually and
already faces cost increases of about #20m this year and perhaps a
similar rise in 1996.
However, he added that no decision had yet been made.
Newspaper publishers' shares reacted positively with The Telegraph,
which would be the biggest beneficiary from any increase in the price of
The Times, jumping 7p at one point before easing to close 3p ahead at
359p. There were similar gains for the Mirror Group and United
Newspapers which publishes the Express titles and the Daily Star.
The price war began in the summer of 1993 when Mr Murdoch's News
International subsidiary in the UK reduced the prices of The Sun from
25p to 20p, but now 22p, and The Times from 45p to 30p and then a year
later to 20p. Other English titles were forced to follow suit with the
hardest hit being The Independent and the Daily Telegraph -- but both
selling at 30p.
According to securities house Goldman Sachs, operating losses at The
Times rose from #10m in 1993 to #28m in the year to June l994, while
profits from the Sun plunged from #70m to #25m.
The Times' circulation since price-cutting has risen by 46% to 599,000
in December, pointing to losses per individual copy sold of around 15p.
It was this which led Newspaper Publishing which owns The Independent
to complain of predatory pricing with losses on the The Times being
offset by profits elsewhere in the Murdoch empire.
Newsprint prices are one of the most important variable costs for a
newspaper publisher with one ton required to produce 4000 broadsheet
papers of 40 pages or 5000 tabloids of 64 pages. The average price in
1994 was about #315 a ton for standard newsprint against a list price of
#450. Put another way, the paper cost is about 7[1/2]p for a broadsheet
and 6p for a tabloid.
The world's largest newsprint producer Abitibi-Price of Canada has
warned of a 12.5% increase to $675 (#427) a ton. But BZW is forecasting
that supply shortages and disruptions could result in a price of over
#600 next year -- Goldman Sachs is looking for a 25% overall rise in
1995 to around #450.
The supply position was underlined on Monday by Kevin McElhatton,
economist at the Canadian Pulp &amp; Paper Association, who said that the
newsprint mills are already running flat out and cannot deliver much
more. That meant strong revenue growth for producers and current trends
should continue through to 1997 and beyond.

THE Scotch whisky industry is furious about the Japanese Government's
rejection of its demand for the ending of a discriminatory liquor tax
system which costs it at least #30m annually in lost exports.
The call for equitable tax treatment of whisky and the local spirit
shochu came from President of the Board of Trade Michael Heseltine, who
is in Tokyo with Hugh Morison, director-general of the Scotch Whisky
Association.
In spite of a ruling in 1987 by the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade that all spirits must be taxed at broadly identical rates, Japan
continues to tax whisky up to seven times as heavily as shochu.
About #139m worth of Scotch whisky is shipped each year to Japan, the
industry's fourth-largest export market, much less than the comparative
1990 figure of #177m.
Since 1989, the market share of shochu has increased from 61% to 74%.
Mr Morison has lambasted the myth that shochu is made by small-scale
producers who need protection. The association said: ''As a major
trading nation, it is outrageous that Japan should continue to brush
aside a ruling of an international trade body, justifying its failure to
act with invalid arguments which do not stand up to scrutiny.''
This week's blow to the whisky industry's long-running campaign is all
the more bitter, in light of an indication last year that Japan
recognised there was a problem.
However, the Scotch Whisky Association believes pursuit of the
campaign through the European Union and World Trade Organisation would
be supported by Canada and the US.

ANOTHER Glasgow-based rented property company, launched in 1988 under
the Business Expansion Scheme, is the target of a takeover bid.
The formula for the bid for Norcity Homes -- a newly-created unit
trust vehicle -- is the same as for the troubled Westscot Homes. As with
Westscot, Neill Clerk Capital is again the inspiration behind the
approach.
The Norcity Residential Unit Trust is offering #1.40 a share for each
of Norcity's 5,328,300 issued ordinary shares, on the basis of seven
units for every five shares.
This time the approach, to a company chaired by former Glasgow Lord
Provost Sir William Gray, looks altogether more friendly.
Neill Clerk &amp; Murray, the legal firm from which Neill Clerk Capital
sprang, was the original promotor of Norcity Homes, the very first BES
company of its type in the UK.
Now that the five year qualifying period for BES tax relief is up,
Norcity's board has been actively exploring ways of creating exits for
investors.
Almost ten per cent of the company's properties were disposed of in
the year to September 1994. A 5p a share dividend was paid. Norcity also
achieved a full listing on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, allowing some
investors to transfer their shares into PEPs.
Some matched bargains were also carried out. But, in a letter to
shareholders, Neill Clerk Capital's chief executive Mr Ross Macdonald
argues that the unit trust vehicle, allowing a shareholder to exit
completely in year one at #1.12 a share, against a net asset value of
#1.40, is the best way of helping both shareholders who wish to continue
with the investment and those who want to get out.
In the year to September, Norcity made a pre-tax profit of #182,039 on
turnover of #620,519. Paying the 5p dividend turned the bottom line into
a loss of #150,220.
The sale of properties brought a loss of #28,936, an indication of the
depressed state of the housing market which now dogs all these rented
housing BES vehicles.

GLASGOW calibration company EMIS, which cut off its Aberdeen and
English arms to save its life after a management buy-out in 1992, is now
in the best of health.
EMIS, which has boosted turnover by more than 50% since it was bought
out 2[1/2] years ago, yesterday officially opened a 5000 sq ft factory
in Shettleston.
Times were not always so good for EMIS, which was forced to shut
factories in Aberdeen and south of the Border at Peterlee, about six
months after current managing director Joseph O'Neil and four managers
took control.
They paid #100,000 of the #400,000 purchase price, with another
#100,000 coming from Scottish Enterprise. British Steel (Industry),
whose investment activities are aimed at countering the crippling
effects of recent steelworks closures, invested #75,000 and banks lent
the rest.
Staff numbers were cut from 43 to 23 but business kept increasing.
EMIS now employs 33 people and has a turnover of #1.25m.
The firm determines the accuracy of measuring instruments used in the
North Sea oil and gas, electronics and heavy engineering industries for
a host of major customers, including Shell, Amerada Hess, BP and IBM.
EMIS, which began as a sole trading operation in the late-1970s and
was developed into a limited company, also has the only UK laboratory
for calibrating audiometers, the devices used to test hearing.
The new factory, which is twice the size of the company's previous
plant next door, was opened by Scottish Enterprise's business
development director, Russel Griggs. He described the turn in EMIS's
fortunes as a ''Scottish business success story for our times''.
Mr O'Neil said: ''We had to take a step back to enable us to go
forward. We really think we are on the right track now.''
John Fairlie, Scottish manager of BS (Industry), said: ''Like any
expanding company it has had some difficult times but it is now growing
well.''

THE annual equity-gilt study from BZW always provides reassurance to
investors worried about their equity holdings, as many are at the moment
after a dull year and when there is the possibility of a further decline
to come.
The study takes a long-term look at returns from gilt and equities
which shows the impressive out-performance of equities. For what it is
worth, the real return after inflation from equities has averaged 7.7% a
year from 1919 and from gilts 1.8%.
However, such a timescale is of little interest. More meaningful are
10-year rolling periods, though the average annual return of any 10-year
period, at 7.2% and 1.4% respectively, does not differ significantly.
Over the latest period, 1985 to 1994, the figures are more impressive,
showing a 9.6% return from equities, 5.8% from gilts and even 5.4% from
Treasury Bills.
As the author of the study, Michael Hughes, points out, this decade
was exceptional for all three classes of investment, including peak
years from all three, namely cash, which achieved 5.7% in 1992, gilts,
which saw 8.4% in 1991 and equities, which grew 17.5% in 1984.
The trends now suggest that returns are heading back towards their
long-term averages, which is the reason incidentally that life offices
are having to cut payouts on with-profits policies.
During 1994 cash was king even if the return was low and it is not
unusual for equities to underperform cash. Over the 76 years of the
survey there have been 30 individual years when it was better to be in
cash.
Equities may be fair value now in comparison with ratings in the past
but they can show wide fluctuations about mean levels. At the end of
1993 they were clearly overvalued, though by not as much as in some
previous peaks.
On past form there is every likelihood there will also be an overshoot
on the downside. This is consistent with the view of many pundits that
the first half of 1995 will remain weak before a recovery sets in during
the second half.
In periods of low inflation, defined as between 1% and 4%, the long
gilt yield has averaged 5.36%, a lot less than the current 8.6%, from
which it is clear that the market just does not believe the era of low
inflation is here to stay. Mr Hughes believes it is but after 25 years
of rapidly fluctuating inflation in the UK it is not surprising that the
market will take some convincing.
Dividend income has always been important to UK institutions, which
kicked up a fuss when it was suggested that companies be less generous
with their dividends and invest more for the long term. There was also
anguish when the Government reduced the tax credit for pension funds to
20%.
The long figures reveal just how important income, or rather the
reinvestment of income, is to performance. Remarkably, an investor who
took his dividends as income has seen an increase in his capital
adjusted for inflation of just 4.2% since 1972, whereas if this income
had been ploughed back into the market the gain would be 227%.
At least pensioners can be reasonably confident their capital will
keep pace with inflation if they take all the income from their equity
investments.
The average dividend yield has been 5.1% and the real return from
equities has been 7.7% a year so it is clear than income has accounted
for two-thirds of the overall return, though this is not necessarily so
over shorter time periods. Capital gain accounted for the outperformance
seen over the past decade but in future investors may have to rely more
on dividends for their investment return.
As it happens, dividend growth correlates closely with the increase in
gross domestic product, though why this should be so is unclear.
The usual reason trotted out for equities' poor performance last year
was that they were following gilts down.

OPPOSITION parties yesterday kept up the pressure on the Government
over the imposition of increased vehicle excise duty in the Highlands
and Islands -- and there were signs of a Government climbdown.
A furious Commons row broke out early yesterday morning over a scheme
which, it is thought, could cost HGV operators in remote areas,
including farmers, thousands of pounds a year. Previously, they paid a
concessionary rate of #150 a year, but under Government proposals in the
Finance Bill this will greatly increase.
According to Liberal Democrat MP Ray Michie -- one of those leading
the campaign against the Government -- some island-based hauliers will
have to pay between #1280 and #4250 a year per vehicle.
As well as adding to the islanders' transport costs, it is claimed
that this is likely to force many smaller firms out of business, with a
consequent reduction in employment on the islands.
Mrs Michie, MP for Argyll and Bute, gave a stark example of the
problem. ''A constituent of mine who runs a tanker to refuel fishing
boats on Mull does only 500 miles a year, yet he is threatened with an
annual vehicle excise duty of #2160. He will have to pass that on to the
fishermen, and they cannot bear that sort of extra burden.''
According to MPs, there are countless examples of this, and they plan
to continue their campaign for change.
In the Commons in the early hours of yesterday morning,
Paymaster-General Mr David Heathcoat-Amory was forced on to the
defensive. He agreed to hold talks with concerned members and that the
House could return to the matter at a later date.
However, just as it appeared a deal had been done, the Tory whips
objected, thus throwing matters into further confusion.
Deputy Speaker Dame Janet Fookes said it would be left to Speaker
Betty Boothroyd, who would be given a full report, to decide the matter.
Both Mrs Michie and Labour MP Brian Wilson -- who strongly attacked Mr
Heathcoat-Amory -- made clear yesterday that they would not let the
matter rest.
Mrs Michie said: ''The Treasury tried to sneak this into the Finance
Bill in a clause which would have meant a huge tax-hike on lorries.'' A
Treasury spokesman said last night: ''There will be no obstacles in the
way of further consideration.''

The lady had looked unwell for a while; now a delicate flush has
returned to her cheeks and her admirers are again seeking an audience.
John Fowler was among them, and admits to being entranced.
FOR a long time Mrs Cunyngham has been an unhealthy yellow. It quite
spoiled her complexion. Happily, she's looking better now. In fact, Mrs
Cunyngham is restored to her full bloom, and after being hidden out of
sight for many years because of her unfortunate condition, can now be
properly appreciated at the National Gallery of Scotland in Edinburgh.
Mrs Cunyngham is the subject of a life-size painting by the
eighteenth-century Scots artist Allan Ramsay, the only full-length
portrait by him in the national collection. It has to be admitted that
she's no beauty -- her nose is rather long, her mouth is slightly
lopsided, and there's a suspicion of a squint. Squint or not, her eyes
are a lovely dark grey and the delicate flush on her cheeks is charming.
''Ramsay didn't try to flatter her,'' says Nicola Christie of the
galleries' conservation department. ''But as a matter of fact, I've been
told that a squint was not considered a disadvantage in those days.''
In particular, now that the painting is on view in the main gallery on
the Mound, it's possible to appreciate the delicate brushwork of the
face, one of the skills which made Ramsay a sought-after portraitist in
his day and which is now bringing him back into critical favour after
being overshadowed by his slightly later contemporaries, Reynolds and
Gainsborough.
The lady was christened Elizabeth but the picture is titled Mrs Daniel
Cunyngham, identifying her with her husband's name in the custom of the
time. It's thought that Ramsay painted her shortly after their marriage
in 1740. Little is known about the couple. They may have been Scots,
though they latterly lived in Ludlow, and Cunyngham owned plantations
and slaves on St Kitts in the West Indies.
The restoration of the portrait took Christie several months. ''The
painting had become very discoloured and yellow because of the
varnish,'' she says. ''Ramsay was known for his flesh tones and all the
subtlety had been lost. But in general the painting was in good
condition, and only a little retouching was needed.''
In retouching, the conservator has to take up her paintbrush and
attempt to reproduce the work of the master, restoring damaged or faded
areas. ''As far as possible we use the same pigments, unless the old
ones are likely to be unstable,'' Christie says. Retouching can be open
to all sorts of controversy, but fortunately Mrs Cunyngham proved to be
pretty straightforward.
As a matter of course, a new coat of varnish is painted over the
original before any retouching is done, so that if any future
conservator has to repeat the process on Mrs Cunyngham, Christie's
overpainting can be easily removed. ''What I do now has to be reversible
in 50 or 100 years,'' she says.
Working closely on a painting, you soon get to know its secrets. ''The
surface tells you a lot about it,'' says Christie, pointing out the
various tell-tale wrinkles, cracks, and marks that become obvious when
you look at the canvas close up.
Not all of Mrs Cunyngham was painted by Ramsay. Being a busy and
popular artist, Ramsay concentrated on the important parts like the face
and left the boring bits to an assistant. Mrs Cunyngham's flowing
silver-grey dress, for example, was probably painted by a Dutchman
called Van Aken employed by Ramsay and others as a drapery specialist.
Behind the portrait is the shadow of another master, silently
acknowledged by Ramsay. Elizabeth's slightly self-conscious stance, with
one hand elegantly extended and the other clasping her skirts, is
modelled on a painting from half a century earlier, a portrait of the
Countess of Ranelagh by Sir Godfrey Kneller, in Hampton Court. Such
homage to the past was not uncommon in Ramsay's day.
* Allan Ramsay's portrait of Mrs Daniel Cunyngham is at the National
Gallery, Edinburgh, until April, after which it goes on permanent show
at the National Galleries outstation at Duff House, Banff.

THE dollar jumped as President Bill Clinton announced his alternative
plan to help Mexico in order to bypass opposition in Congress.
Sterling finished almost 1[1/4] cents down at $1.5817 but Continental
currencies fared worse so that the pound gained nearly 1[1/2] pfennigs
at DM2.4102.
The dollar had earlier been inclined weaker on fears the Mexican
rescue plan would not be passed if put before Congress. In the event, Mr
Clinton used his own powers to announce a #20bn aid plan as part of a
larger international package to stabilise the peso.
The news certainly had this effect and brought a surge in the dollar,
though some dealers wondered how long this would continue. Overlying the
Mexican drama was the expectation of a half-point increase in interest
rates by the US Federal Reserve.
However, US data published yesterday suggested inflationary pressures
were not building despite the 4.5% rise in annual GDP growth reported
recently. The consumer confidence index turned lower and the Chicago
purchasing managers' index was less than expected. Employment cost
figures were also encouraging.

THE GOVERNOR of the Bank of England, Mr Eddie George, yesterday sought
to dampen interest rate speculation ahead of an expected increase in
rates this week after his regular monthly meeting with Chancellor
Kenneth Clarke which takes place tommorrow.
However, his comments, initially in an interview to a French newspaper
and later followed up when he spoke to reporters after a speech to
French bankers, made in Paris appeared to be aimed at future
expectations rather than immediate prospects for UK base rates.
They were interpreted differently by some economists though financial
markets are discounting a half-point increase to 6[3/4]%. Markets have,
of course, been wrongfooted before.
Mr George said that they are exaggerating the inflationary pressures
and the severity of the monetary policy which should be put in place.
He said growth appeared to be slowing to a more sustainable level
though this had yet to be confirmed. Gross domestic product was still
growing at above the long-term trend which he put at between 2% and
2[1/2]%. And he reiterated that the UK would not return to the days when
interest rates were lifted by one or even two points at a time.
The Governor is committed to taking action fairly early in small steps
thus preventing rates from rising to 9% as some in the market fear.
This certainly does not rule out a half-point, or perhaps just a
quarter-point rise -- assuming that the Chancellor goes along with the
suggestion.
But the Governor also warned that if the Federal Open Market Committee
in the US lifted US interest rates, as is widely expected, that would
make an increase at home more likely though it would only be one factor
in the evaluation.
But while some economists felt that the Governor's remarks meant that
a rate rise was not quite as certain as they had thought, the majority
are still looking for an increase.
The Governor appears to be boxing cleverly, dampening down the
market's longer-term interest rate signals, which he regards as too
high, while leaving the way clear for an increase this week, or next
month if the Chancellor would like to examine see further economic data
before making a decision.
In the US, virtually all financial analysts see a half-point rise in
US rates, which would be the seventh in the last year. The US economy is
growing strongly, running at or above capacity, and the market believes
that the FOMC has little choice but to lift rates if it is to prevent a
damaging increase in inflation.
President Bill Clinton, meanwhile, has been forced to scrap his $40bn
loan guarantees aid to struggling Mexico because of heavy opposition in
the US Congress. He is to use his own authority to provide about $20bn
in US aid as part of an international package.
The President said it had become clear his $40bn rescue plan was
stirring heavy dissent in Congress and would not be approved soon enough
given Mexico's severe financial crisis.
President Clinton said he had worked with other countries to prepare a
new package. In addition to the US contribution -- which comes from the
US exchange stabilisation fund which can be authorised by executive
action without a new act of Congress -- there will be $17.5bn from the
International Monetary Fund and a ''short-term lending facility'' of
$10bn from the Bank for International Settlements.
The President said the risks of inaction over Mexico are greater than
the risks of decisive action.
Mr George yesterday called for a more open-minded approach to Europe
from both sides of the increasingly bitter political divide.
Within the European Monetary Institute, the embryo European Central
Bank, there was an immense amount of technical analysis to do in
exploring the arrangements necessary for the operation of monetary union
if and when it came about, Mr George said in a speech in Paris.

Michael Tumelty peers into the fiery depths of the Faust Cantata --
which includes one of the most stunning musical and dramatic effects
ever -- and looks forward to its first Scottish performance, under the
new principal guest conductor Alexander Lazarev.
LADIES and gentlemen, welcome to Hell. And, specifically, to the first
Scottish performances, this Friday and Saturday, of the Faust Cantata by
Russian composer Alfred Schnittke.
Now hang on a minute. Before the anti-modern hordes -- famous for
voting with their feet as soon as they get a sniff of a living composer
-- tune out and switch off, listen for just a moment.
Yes, the Faust Cantata is a modern piece -- it was written in 1983 --
but it is easily accessible music, borrowing its structure from familiar
cantata and oratorio precedents way back to Bach.
Okay? Still here? Further, much of the style of the choral writing in
Schnittke's work is derived directly from the grand tradition of Bach
right through to Brahms; you will recognise that immediately at the
start of the opening chorus.
Still with me? One more thing then, in preamble; if you do miss this
week's concerts in Edinburgh and Glasgow by the Royal SNO, then you will
be missing the first official visit to the orchestra by Bolshoi chief
Alexander Lazarev in his new post of principal conductor to the SNO and,
in the Scottish premiere of the Schnittke, you will also be missing what
should be one of the spectacular musical highlights of the season.
So: to the Faust Cantata. Subtitled after its closing chorus, Seid
Nuchtern und Wachet (Be Sober and Alert) the cantata was written to a
commission from the Vienna Festival. Schnittke has described it as ''a
negative Passion'' which ''depicts the way to suffering of an evil
Christian''.
The work is scored for four vocal soloists, choir, and a vast
orchestra. In addition to the regular SNO (with expanded wind, brass,
and percussion sections) the cantata features four keyboards -- piano,
celeste, harpsichord, and organ. It also features electric guitar, bass
guitar, and alto and baritone saxes. (Schnittke deploys his army with
considerable discretion.)
For the soloists he has borrowed the form of the great baroque
Passions: the tenor is the narrator and Faust is sung by the bass. What
is different is his original use of two soloists for the two-faced
devil, Mephistopheles: a counter-tenor (oily and hypocritical), and a
deep female alto voice (malevolently triumphal).
The cantata is in 10 sections and runs, without a break, for around 35
minutes. It opens with a slow, insidious, and ominous tango rhythm
(which sounds like a death march and later returns at the climax with
sensational effect). The chorus sings a prologue, outlining the
cautionary nature of the tale, around which woodwind phrases curl,
unfurling like tendrils of evil.
The tenor-narrator takes up the tale, telling of Faust's pact with the
devil, during which the oily countertenor Mephistopheles appears.
After an open-voiced tavern chorus, Faust makes his first appearance,
surrounded and ensnared by tentacles of sound. He takes his farewell and
asks forgiveness of his friends. The horror of his impending fate is
graphically portrayed in the orchestral music.
The horror-stricken chorus, aghast at what he has done, implores him
solemnly to seek forgiveness. But it's too late.
After an anguished narration, the two voices of Mephistopheles appear
together in a hideously seductive section formed from an evil mix of the
purity of Bach and the sexual ecstasy of Wagner's Tristan. The effect,
beautiful yet repellant, is chilling as the music builds to its climax,
where the tango rhythm erupts purposefully.
This section -- a real tango from Hell -- is one of the most stunning
musical and dramatic effects you are likely to experience in the concert
hall. The devil, in the shape of the alto (the inimitable Sarah Walker
gets the best tune) climbs out of the depths baying for the soul of
Faust.
She piles in with the tango, followed by the orchestra. The refrain
sounds like a meeting between Kurt Weill and Satan in a Berlin cabaret
of the 1930s. As the chorus joins in and the texture builds with eerie
sounds contributed by the flexatone, choral whistling, and bass guitar,
the wall-of-sound effect is devastating.
The music subsides through ghostly evocations of Faust, his familiar,
Wagner (opening bar of Tristan quoted), a solemn choral incantation
which precedes the introduction of a note of childlike innocence, and --
with all four soloists -- a cautionary note to end, which builds into a
searing, impassioned plea for faith and opposition to the devil.
A stunningly written and enormously effective piece. Do not miss it.
* Michael Tumelty will review the Faust Cantata from the Usher Hall on
Friday night. Read his review in Saturday's Herald before the Glasgow
performance.

STUDENT leaders yesterday accused Labour of abandoning undergraduates
after only eight of the party's peers voted in the House of Lords for a
motion which, if passed, would have reduced hardship.
The motion, to restore to students the right to claim housing benefit
and income support during summer holidays, was proposed by Liberal
democrat peer Lord Addington but defeated by 86 votes to 38. Labour's
Front Bench in the Lords abstained.
Mr Stephen Magee, president of Edinburgh University Students'
Association, said: ''We had expected opposition from the Government but
for Labour to fail to support this motion seriously calls into question
its commitment to higher education.''
A spokesman for the Liberal Democrats accused Labour of using an
obscure procedural reason for failing to support the call. ''Labour is
totally unwilling to commit itself to anything while it has a chance of
forming the Government. It is looking at its plans for higher education
and is not willing to do anything.''

WHEN Ella Harris's Mercy emerges from among the audience of
schoolchildren to begin her adventures, the Sonic T-shirt is a broad
hint. This neo-Gothic post-civil war fantasy tries to ensnare the young
people by appealing to them on their own familiar territory -- that of
the computer game. The MacBob's vault-like studio was a perfect venue,
and TAG Theatre Company have just been justifiably rewarded for their
continuing high standard in the Scottish Arts Council's new active
approach to funding.
Unfortunately Vivien Adam's new play is not a great cause for
rejoicing. The concept is a good one -- a totalitarian state where
children are neither seen nor heard and ''young'' is a pejorative term.
Outside the citadel of Grimstane the Prats, Scabends, and Kurbs fight
among themselves in a wasteland. Inside the ''true and great peacedom''
the ruling class usher in an era of ''moral happiness and healthy
habits''.
The rhetoric of state is well-rendered and the evil Lady Claw (Janet
Dye), and the hapless Foulbladder (Gregor Duncan) have some memorable
phrases to toy with, while Steven Leach doubles well between the
radically different roles of Snakepit and escaped youth Pinch. But Adam
labours an already explicit allegory about coming of age to the point of
tedium, regrettably patronising an audience the play has gone out of its
way to meet on its own level.
Matt Johnson's set is more suitably eye-catching than terribly
practically useful, but director Leslie Finlay's attempts to keep things
cracking along at a suitable pace are ultimately more hampered by a
script that could only be salvaged with a vicious pruning.

STRINDBERG'S Easter is rarely produced and in a way, you can see why.
It has a haunting, strangely naive, almost obsessive quality that's hard
to contain, never mind enthuse about. Yet it also has a way of lodging
itself limpet-like in the mind afterwards. We're talking here of guilt,
spiritual and emotional torment, and a desire for release so strong you
wonder how Strindberg managed to cope at all with the demons that were
so obviously plaguing him. Frequently of course he didn't stop.
Teetering on the brink of -- sometimes slipping over into -- insanity,
his later plays have the disquieting sense of the visionary about them.
Subtitled ''a Passion Play'', Easter was in fact written shortly after
Strindberg had undergone a religious conversion, and in many ways its
symbolism is extremely heavy-handed -- in the character of Elenora, the
mentally unstable but purifying daughter, and in its punitive,
calvinistic school of belief.
And yet director Katie Mitchell and her marvellously young cast (Lucy
Whybrow, Adrian Rawlins, Daniel Betts, and Heather Ackroyd) and a
white-haired Philip Locke as a terrifying but benevolent avenging angel
create something close to sacramental. It is very much a play of
redemption and the consequences of human action. What goes around comes
around, as they say, as a Swedish bourgeois household, ruined by the
father who has been found guilty of embezzlement, battle to overcome
their sense of social ostracism.
Slowly paced but cumulatively riveting, Mitchell's austere production,
with its quivering, thorn-drenched Christ figure and tumultuous strains
of Bach's St Matthew's Passion, in the end does indeed bring
Strindberg's suffering humanity to a stern kind of resting place. Not to
everyone's taste maybe but definitely one for the connoisseurs.

WITH the spotlight on gay theatre in London it is particularly welcome
to get a chance to see the revival of Cheek by Jowl's As You Like It
performed by an all-male cast. Not that this is an overtly gay
production, but the tensions created by having men playing women throw
up all sorts of fashionable sexual questions.
Take the scenario of a man, playing a woman playing a man, trying to
seduce another man. Or, a man playing a woman in love with a man who is
supposed to be a woman playing a man; or even two men playing women who
are passionate about each other. Confused? You won't be. Cheek by Jowl
explore every ambiguity created by using only male actors with clarity
and verve.
Adrian Lester, who won a 1991 Time Out Award when the production was
first performed, returns to play Rosalind. He is ably supported by Simon
Coates as a truculent and jealous Celia. Their ability to convince the
audience that they are indeed women is crucial and yet their androgyny
fuels the play and can be mesmerising. Wayne Carter, as Phebe, and
Richard Cant as Audrey exploit every trick known to drag artists and
makes the second half of the play extremely funny -- helped by Peter
Needham playing Touchstone as a Bruce Forsyth lookalike.
Declan Donnellan's production focuses on sexual frustration. The
resultant friction and petty squabbles between the characters is highly
enjoyable. The downside to this interpretation is that scenes where all
the characters are supposed to be men can seem flat. In particular,
Jaques, camply played by Michael Gardiner, cannot compete for the
audience's attention, despite having the best speech in the play.

AS a mother killing her child is a terrible taboo, it seems obvious
that such a scenario would lend itself well to dramatic exploitation,
yet there is nothing exploitative about this monologue by Incidental
Theatre in association with Dark Horse Theatre Company. Writers Anna
Reynolds and Moira Buffini bring an understanding to the subject which
has nothing to do with liberal ''compassion'' and everything to do with
uncanny perceptiveness.
In dramatising the true story of ''Shirley Jones,'' played by Buffini,
they do not just unravel the events and emotions which drive a loving
mother to murder her child, they also subtly but chillingly convey the
potential emotional chasms in us all. A portrait of fear and
desperation, its most awful achievement, like Tony Morrison's novel
Beloved, is in depicting an inevitability about an incomprehensible act.
Throughout her intense performance Buffini is trapped within a small,
restrictive white circle -- alternatively representing the dead end of
her small-town adolescent life, the suffocating strictures of her
relationship with an abusive violent man, and the confines of prison
life -- like a butterfly stuck on a pin. The props are grossly
disproportioned, exacerbating the sense of a socially inept Shirley
being overwhelmed by the events around her. She writhes on a massive
wooden chair as she tells her story, her animated tone at odds with the
brutal scenes she describes.
The writing is impeccable, shot through with startling imagery,
resonating with a deep if dreadful love and eschewing melodrama or
pathos in a evocation of tragedy so pure I felt rocked with shock.
Buffini's performance is so unflinching, so solid, that you will leave
the theatre dissolved by it.

A WOMAN, in casual trousers and a loose top, is running through some
flamenco steps. Her knees splay out as she struts and stamps -- and it's
utterly wonderful. Usually her legs would be shrouded in frothing skirts
and all our attention would go to her feet. But this is a show about the
blood and bones of flamenco, a show that wants to bring alive its
everyday side, the side that goes on without the cabaret flounces that
have become its popular, touristico image.
The entire first half Flamenco Fire -- presented by Paco Pena and his
company -- is a cross between a rehearsal and a gathering of friends.
The mood, like the clothing, is informal but the dance is far from
sloppy.
The two male dancers -- Joaquim Ruiz and El Torombo -- come together
in a sequence where they seem to swap steps, duel a little, each
displaying his own proficiency without ever being a clone of the other.
This opening section, with its unflamboyant nature in fact celebrates,
almost better than the exhibition material, the meaty strengths and
individuality not just of the different dance styles but of the
different performers.
The second half is, really, the ''recital'', the platform display of
virtuoso skills. Again, Pena and his group skirt the worst excesses of
cabaret costume. Angelita Espanadero is almost frighteningly intense in
the quality of her graceful attack. Ruiz has a fierce neatness about
him.
The musicans, Pena leading them, provide rawness and subtlety as they
shade in atmospheres for the dance. The true heart of flamenco is just
so richly celebrated here, simply because Pena and his troup show us
that flamenco doesn't need to be dressed up like a souvenir doll to
entertain and delight.

THE Army, faced with the inevitable loss of High Street recruiting
offices under Government cutbacks, is resorting to schools to persuade
youngsters to accept the Queen's shilling.
The new recruiting programme goes well beyond those privileged
educational establishments which traditionally have run cadet corps and
provided officer class material. This project is aimed at the rank and
file.
A huge mailshot of schools throughout the country has led to teachers
volunteering to set up clubs that will give pupils a ''privileged
insight'' into the Army, the opportunity to learn survival skills, and
the right to wear a specially designed baseball hat . . . all for the
knockdown price of #5.
The programme envisages one teacher per school leading 15 pupils in
the new club. It is aimed at those aged between 11 and 13, but will be
linked to the Army's youth club -- Challenger Team -- which caters for
those up to the age of 16.
Up to 20% of the 600 Scottish schools circulated have come back with a
positive response, according to the Army. Throughout Britain, more than
2000 schools have signed up.
Members of the new club, known as School Challenger, will be able to
visit military units. They will be taught varying skills in the hope
that they will choose a career with the armed forces once they finish
their education.
Despite the job losses in the Army that have been a direct result of
the Government's Options for Change programme, the Army will require to
recruit 14,000 soldiers a year.

STRATHCLYDE region has become the first local authority in Britain to
use BBC2's night-time education slot to communicate with its 104,000
staff.
The region is making three programmes dealing with the problems of
local government reorganisation. The first will be screened at 5am next
Tuesday.
Mr John Brown, head of public relations, said yesterday: ''We don't
expect all our staff to be sitting at their TV sets at that time. But we
hope they will video the programmes and watch them with their
families.''
The first programme, presented by BBC Scotland's Sally McNair, gives
the background to the reorganisation and the reasons for the changes.
Strathclyde region's Labour leaders have strongly opposed winding up
the region and putting 12 single-tier councils in its place.
Mr Brown, however, insists that the programmes, which cost #8000 to
#9000 each to make, do not go over old ground.
''We do mention that the council was against reorganisation, but the
point of the programme is to look ahead to the changes and advise staff
about them.''
The second, due to be transmitted on March 7 at the same time, will
deal with issues such as compensation and redundancy.
Programme three, for screening on May 9, deals with the work of the
region's helpline on reorganisation.

LOCAL authorities have been warned that they could face severe
financial penalties for implementing summary warrants to recover poll
tax debts if the European Commission on Human Rights views the warrants
as illegal.
The Scottish Anti-Poll Tax Federation said yesterday it believed a
ruling by the commission that an English man was wrongly jailed for
failing to pay the tax demonstrated there was a ''chink in the armour''
of procedures laid down by the Government.
The federation was now more confident that a separate case, being
pursued on behalf of a Scottish man claiming that the summary warrant
procedure was illegal, would succeed.
It claimed a successful action would have ''horrendous'' implications
for the Government and Scottish local authorities because the several
million summary warrants issued would be shown to have been unsafe.
It has urged councils to stop implementing them immediately because
they might be acting illegally.
As many as 1000 people jailed for failing to pay poll tax could be in
line for compensation because of the commission's ruling that unemployed
Mr Stephen Benham, 28, was wrongly jailed for 30 days in 1991 for
failing to pay his #355 community charge.
Mr Benham, whose parents live in Poole, Dorset, could receive as much
as #20,000 in compensation from the Government if the European Court of
Human Rights supports the decision in October.
The federation said yesterday it believed summary warrant procedures
also breached the human rights convention because they did not allow a
hearing at which the subject could state his or her case.
Mr Tommy Sheridan, federation chairman and Scottish Militant Labour's
leader, said that, because summary warrant procedures were used in 99%
of poll tax debt recovery cases in Scotland, compensation from the
Government if the procedures were judged illegal would result in
councils facing large financial penalties.
''If the European Commission were to find in favour of the case Gordon
Dangerfield is pursuing, then the implication quite clearly is that
every summary warrant that has been granted in Scotland then becomes
questionable.''
0   A spokesman for Strathclyde Regional Council rejected the
federation's claims and said none of the commission's findings in
relation to Mr Benham applied in Scotland because ''we don't have the
power to imprison''. He added: ''There is a right of appeal to a sheriff
against the imposition of the community charge.''

I AM in no doubt that the statements made by Alex Salmond represent a
considerable shift in policy and tone for SNP strategy in the
constitutional debate, witness Margaret Ewing who described this as a
''pragmatic move''.
The present debate is hopelessly imbalanced. The Tories support the
status quo, a policy which was rejected by 75% of Scots voters at the
last election. Independence in Europe, the Scottish National Party's
position, is now supported by detailed policy and budget statements and
has been subject to public and political scrutiny for a number of years.
Labour supports devolution, but nobody has seen a draft Bill; nobody
knows what powers it may contain or, more importantly, which powers will
be retained at Westminster. The SNP has let Labour off the hook in this
important debate, allowing them to get away with the giant con trick of
supporting a ''Scottish Parliament'' but never revealing that it is more
likely to resemble Strathclyde Region Mark II than a meaningful
parliament.
It is astonishing that anyone in the SNP finds a problem in answering
a journalist's question of how SNP MPs would vote if a Labour devolution
Bill was presented in Parliament. Most SNP members would say ''give me
more details'', ''let's see the Bill'', or perhaps ''I'm not sure if my
health will hold long enough to see this great event -- after all I'm 22
now!'' There is no obligation on the SNP to answer that question until
we know the details of Labour's plans.
Many of my colleagues see us as involved in a war of attrition with
Labour, believing that Scotland will never see a meaningful parliament
by voting Labour because Labour cannot be trusted to deliver since they
see Westminster as the main prize.
Many of the collective leadership, predominantly from the North-east,
see this battle as damaging, failing to recognise that the friendly,
gentlemanly wee Labour Party of the rural North-east is a far cry from
the Labour mafia faced by SNP activists down here. They do not like the
harsh language used in the Labour heartlands. Activists are asked to
''tone it down'', leaving the field clear for the advance of Tony
Blair's pink army.
By pursuing this strategy of disengagement with Labour they appear
blind to the fact that you cannot win independence on the back of
disillusioned Tory votes. That strategy may help to win a few seats
north of the Tay but it will never deliver the wedge of Labour seats in
urban Scotland that we require for our independence mandate.
In a decade when support for the SNP's fundamental aim of independence
has never been higher, when a record vote was achieved at the European
elections, and when Labour are abandoning every principle they ever held
dear, it beggars belief that the SNP should be throwing its opponents a
lifeline. If ever there was a danger of snatching defeat from the jaws
of victory this is surely it.
It is for those reasons that many activists in areas where Labour are
the main Unionist enemy (and this is most of Scotland) are so upset by
this dilution of policy. It is undoubtedly possible for the SNP to win a
mandate at the next General Election if the party campaigns for what it
believes in.
Despite the opinion polls, there is no certainty that Labour will win
the next General Election; there is still time for the Tories to recover
as they did in 1983, 1987 and 1992. Even if Labour were successful,
experience gives us grounds to believe they would fail to honour their
pre-election promises. More to the point, a Labour victory is dependent
on the English electorate, leaving Scotland's fate once again hanging on
the whims of Essex man and woman.
It is vitally important that Alex thinks again and makes clear to all
in Scotland that the only sure way of attaining independence is by
voting for it, and that means the SNP.

POLITICAL satirists have a tough job in the search for absurdity which
is more extreme than reality. Who could have written the Tory master
plan for the railways as a spoof without being accused of going
completely over the top?
I thought that this week's story about a ScotRail train being
dispatched to Derby by road, because it was cheaper than sending it by
rail, was one of the best so far. No longer are the tracks there as the
basis of a service, but as an instrument which allows the levying of
charges.
What prospect is there of transferring freight from road to rail, one
might reasonably ask, when it is cheaper even for trains to be put on
the back of a lorry than it is to pay charges which will allow Railtrack
to pay the Treasury, and so on round the circle?
Then we had Mr Major explaining in the Commons yesterday how it is
better to have half the number of services ''guaranteed'' under a
private operator, than currently exist in reality under the auspices of
British Rail's fragmented, but still publicly owned, subsidiaries.
The glum looks behind him suggested that an increasing number of Tory
MPs would greatly prefer rail privatisation, and all its myriad works,
to disappear into the nearest available siding and stop causing them so
much electoral difficulty. Cheer up, lads. The show has hardly begun!
* IF there is one subject (other than rail privatisation) about which
I could speak all night, without too many pauses, it is the economy of
Scottish islands. In the early hours of yesterday morning I was in
danger of doing just that.
Therein lies another tale about the arrogance with which the business
of Government is conducted; in this case where the rights and interests
of small numbers of people are involved.
The House of Commons is a strangely unpredictable place. Few would
have put bets on the extension of full vehicle excise duty to all
lorries based on offshore islands becoming the hot-spot debate on the
Finance Bill, which implements the Budget.
Least of all did the Treasury Minister, David Heathcote-Amery, suspect
any such thing. To say that he knew nothing about the subject, and cared
less, would be a kind way of putting it. But if that is the case, why
should he be put in charge of legislating for it? Therein lies the
arrogance and contempt.
Haulage firms based on islands with no plating and weighting
facilities enjoy the concession of paying just #150 per year in road
tax, instead of sums of between #1280 and #4250 per year. Last year it
was proposed that the concession should end.
MPs with island interests argued that legitimate operators either
don't go off the islands or else pay through the nose in ferry charges.
If, as the Government claims, mainland firms are abusing the system by
registering dishonestly as island operators, then that is an abuse that
could be clamped down on.
But the Treasury insisted on taking a hammer to crack an island nut.
The whole concession was to be wiped out. Lorries which never leave
Arran or Barra should pay the same as those which thunder daily up and
down the M1. According to Ray Michie, LibDem MP for Argyll and Bute,
even the little shunting wagons which never leave CalMac piers are to be
taxed at #3150 per year!
With 250 Tory MPs waiting to go home, we argued persistently that this
was all unfair and absurd. We were joined by the Tory MP who has the
Scillies in his constituency, and by Ian Paisley who has Rathlin.
Everyone, including the hapless Minister, knew that we had won the
argument -- but the Tory Whips would not give ground.
So we dug in for a long night, in the knowledge that as long as we
talked, Tory MPs would have to stay there in case there was a vote. I
started at 10 past midnight on what could have been an extremely lengthy
verbal tour of the Scottish islands. An hour later, Mr Heathcote-Amery
finally gave the promises we were looking for, of a meeting with him and
a further debate.
It was a good little symbolic victory for one particular reason. I
hate the assumption that legislation which adversely affects a tiny
number of people who don't have much voice can be driven through without
challenge. If nothing else, the Tories have learned this week that
Britain's island communities have a few quite determined defenders.
* UNBEKNOWN to MPs who were defending island interests, we had an even
more uncomprehending audience in newsrooms and sports desks around the
country. They were waiting for an adjournment debate on football, which
involved some juicy material about a certain Mr Venables. Until the
words were spoken under parliamentary privilege they couldn't publish! I
hope they understand.
So much of what this Government does these days reeks of ''been there
too long'' syndrome. On matters large and small, they resent challenge
and ignore alarm bells -- even when sounded from their own side. Rail
fragmentation is the classic example of that, and it will cost them
dear.

Jennifer Cunningham reports how television advertisements and
programmes which encourage pigging out, pumping up, or slimming down
will be subject to a new code which aims to limit some of the excesses
of the body industry
FROM today, comedian Harry Enfield will be able to load only one Dime
bar into his shopping trolley. Advertisements which disparage good
nutritional practice have been outlawed by the Independent Television
Commission. There will be no more trolleys overflowing with chocolate,
no more gluttons pigging out on whole boxes of sweets because such
creative treatments could be seen as encouraging or condoning
overindulgence, according to the ITC.
Its new code covering the advertising of food, slimming products and
pharmaceutical products has been drawn up as a result of debate sparked
by the Government's Health of the Nation White Paper of 1992, which
emphasised the importance of healthier diet in combating
life-threatening conditions such as heart disease.
Concern about eating disorders has brought about a ban on
advertisments for slimming products, treatments and establishments
(including slimming clubs) before, during and after children's
programmes.
Significantly, the prohibition has been extended to programmes
''principally directed at or likely to be of particular appeal to
audiences below the age of 18''. That means programmes such as Baywatch,
Gladiators, Don't Forget Your Toothbrush and the ITV Chart Show, said an
ITC spokesman.
New rules on the content of such advertisements take on board the
much-criticised subliminal messages conveyed by body shapes. From now on
ads for any form of slimming product must not be directed at the obese
and must not suggest or imply that being underweight is acceptable or
desirable.
Sue Dibb of the National Food Alliance is one of the many people
concerned about the effect advertising has on what is acceptable body
shape. ''We are concerned about the representation of too-thin women,
not just in advertisements for slimming products but in more general
advertising.
''Advertisements are part of the climate of culture and we are very
pleased that the ITC has made some welcome tightening up of the rules,
particularly on the advertising of slimming products. There is now good
evidence that children, girls in particular, begin to worry about their
body image from as young as seven.
''We have to acknowledge that the cumulative message -- not just from
advertising but from everything including pop videos and using sexual
attraction to sell products in a subtle way -- has a big part to play.
There is also a cycle here in that daughters whose mothers are picky
about food will pick up that message as well,'' she said.
While pleased with the ITC's responsibility about slimming products,
the NFA, an umbrella body for 50 organisations including everyone from
farmers to dieticians, was disappointed there were not similar
restrictions on junk food.
''They are not doing anything about the totality of advertising
messages. There are still going to be just as many advertisements for
sweets and fatty foods at times when children are watching. We think the
ITC have ducked out of that issue,'' added Ms Dibb.
The food alliance's suggestion of quotas was rejected as unworkable by
the industry, the Government and the regulatory bodies and they are now
campaigning for Government-funded advertising for a health diet.
According to Ms Dibb, #5m a year is spent on advertising fresh fruit and
vegetables against #100m advertising confectionery.
Not surprisingly, the idea of more advertising for healthier types of
food was also favoured by Andrew Brown, director general of the
Advertising Association, which represents both the advertising industry
and advertisers.
He agrees with the ITC that there is no evidence for banning specific
product types -- such as confectionery. ''Almost all advertising in this
area is for individual brands and the relationship between individual
brands competing within a particular category. There is quite a lot of
evidence about competition between brands but not that people buy more
of that particular category of product as a result.
''Scotland is very interesting because the health education authority
has been promoting the eating of more fruit and vegetables. To my mind,
that is a much more positive way to approach it than to ban particular
categories,'' he added.
The National Food Alliance was overplaying the gullibility of children
in his opinion: ''There are a whole range of foods which are hardly
advertised at all such as chips, which children like and ask their
parents for. There is a lot of evidence to show that children are very
aware of the persuasive nature of advertising. It obviously depends on
age, but young children do not have very much pocket money and are not
able to do things without their parents' knowledge and consent, and
older children are not gullible in the way that has been suggested.''
Most parents, however, are on the side of the National Food Alliance.
An opinion poll conducted for the NFA last summer found that two-thirds
of parents wanted tougher controls on food advertising directed at
children and that three-quarters thought that food advertisements did
not encourage children to eat a balanced diet.
The NFA's recommendations on food advertising have now been endorsed
by more than 50 organisations including the British Heart Foundation,
the British Dental Association and the British Dietetic Association.

TIGHTER control of local enterprise companies in Scotland has been
recommended in a draft report to MPs.
The confidential draft chairman's report of the Scottish Select
Committee's examination of Scottish Enterprise and local enterprise
companies was handed to MPs yesterday, and reflects the view that
regulation should be strengthened.
It is likely that the 60-page document will provoke heated exchanges
when MPs meet to discuss it and prepare their final report.
One key recommendation in the report, prepared by the committee
chairman, Labour MP Willie McKelvey, is that it ''may be appropriate for
there to be greater local authority representation on Lec boards'' in
parts of Scotland where local authorities are the largest employers and
where the private sector is weak.
The draft report also recommends a system for the rotation of board
members and that there should be a procedure for ''accountability
through openness'' -- equivalent to that developed by Highlands and
Islands Enterprise -- to be part of Scottish Enterprise's contract with
the Scottish Office Industry Department.
Mr McKelvey, MP for Kilmarnock and Loudoun, also makes clear he wants
a proper structure of benchmarking of administration costs, and Scottish
Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise to collect and publish
data from the Lecs on the amounts spent on consultancy fees.

TORY rebels met last night to decide when to return from their exile.
They have now scaled down their demands to ease them back on to the Tory
Whip in the Commons and so restore the Government's overall majority.
Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd is no longer a Cabinet scalp that they
desire in order to assert the move within the Tory Party and the Cabinet
and defeat the possibility of further European Union diminution of
British sovereignty.
Sir Teddy Taylor last night issued a statement on behalf of eight
rebel MPs -- they exclude Mr Michael Carttiss, who is also deprived of
the party Whip -- modifying their demands. Until now, these have
included calling on the Prime Minister to commit himself against a
single EU currency.
Mr Hurd is no longer a target for the rebels because his recent public
statements have brought him into line with the Government's approach and
planning for next year's vital negotiations at the inter-governmental
conference.
Sir Teddy said after the meeting: ''We are happy with the way things
are going. We would like things to become a little more specific. We
have been much encouraged by the recent statements by the Prime Minister
and others about the European Union.''
The rebel group claimed that Conservative opinion is moving closer to
public opinion. ''We believe that a more specific definition of the
powers which we think should be returned to member states of the EU
would be particularly helpful and would thereby offer a real alternative
to Labour, which clearly now supports more power to the European
Union.''
The statement was issued by Sir Teddy, Sir Richard Body, Mr Nicholas
Budgen, Mr Christopher Gill, Mrs Teresa Gorman, Mr Tony Marlow, Mr
Richard Shepherd and Mr John Wilkinson.
The rebels now look to the Prime Minister, in his next major speech,
to give them a clearer idea of how he intends to set about wresting
powers back from Brussels to national parliaments.
Mr Major is scheduled to make such a speech within a fortnight and the
rebels have now made it much easier for him to set out a case that will
allow them to negotiate a return to the Commons Whip.
After a series of statements from Cabinet Ministers, including Mr
Hurd, Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind and Chancellor Kenneth Clarke
over the last week, it should now be easy for the Prime Minister to
respond to the rebels' demands now that they have been scaled down.
However, Board of Trade President Michael Heseltine, a strong
pro-European, yesterday sounded a warning from the Euro-enthusiast side
of the Cabinet against giving the impression that Britain was not
committed to Europe.
''We would be taking the most grave risks if we were to allow those
people backing Britain in Europe as inward investors to have doubts
about our commitment at the heart of Europe,'' he said.
Pro-European Tories are meeting today amid signs of concern and anger
among party Euro-enthusiasts about the Cabinet's Euro policy upheaval.
Party chairman Jeremy Hanley has been invited to attend the Positive
European Group meeting.
Meanwhile, the European Parliament's powerful socialist group,
dominated by the British Labour Euro-MPs, yesterday put its name to a
discussion paper suggesting a range of new integrationist measures for
the European Union.
In most respects, the ideas presented by the group are at odds with
the increasingly Euro-sceptic line of the British Government ahead of
next year's critical Maastricht 2 negotiations.
The group's ideas include an end of the British opt-out from the
Social Chapter of Maastricht, weakening of the national veto in the
Council of Ministers, more powers for the European Parliament and a
single European currency.
On all of these issues, except the single currency, Mr Major has
promised resistance. British participation in monetary union will be a
matter for Parliament to decide.
The paper's contents are not official policy for Labour or the
221-strong socialist group. Labour's Pauline Green, the London Euro-MP
who leads the group in the EP, made clear in Brussels that the paper,
written by former French European Affairs Minister Elisabeth Guigou, a
socialist Euro-MP, was merely a list of suggestions for discussion.
One of the most controversial suggestions is that the EP should have
power to elect the president of the European Commission. This would be
an advance for the assembly which at present can only reject his (or
her) candidature on a purely consultative basis. More significantly, the
paper suggests the commission president could be the President of the
European Council -- a greatly increased role for Mr Jacques Santer or
his successors.
On the thorny question of the national veto -- the prime issue for the
British government in the Maastricht 2 talks -- the group suggests that
more majority voting would ease EU decision-making and that the practice
should be extended.
New areas for majority voting, the group suggests, would be foreign
policy, funding of the EU through its own resources, enlargement,
defence and treaty revisions. However, unanimity could be retained
during a period of transition. All options should be examined, the
report suggested.
Mrs Green said she accepted that the EU had gone ahead of public
opinion at Maastricht and warned against a repeat of the mistake. ''It
was a calamity in terms of awareness of the general public,'' she said.
''Clarity is needed from governments about what sort of Europe they are
trying to create.''

THE Scottish Rugby Union is to mount an undercover operation when
Scotland play Ireland at Murrayfield on Saturday, as part of its
campaign to end the trade in black market hospitality packages.
Carnegie Sports International, marketing advisers to the SRU's
Murrayfield stadium debenture scheme, has already purchased so-called
pirate packages from English operators and says that, in future, firms
entertaining guests on ''pirate'' tickets run a real risk of having
their clients ejected from the ground.
Last night, this latest move in the battle over the Murrayfield
hospitality market brought a furious response from one hospitality
operator, Mr Mike Burton, who said his Gloucester-based organisation
would not be there on Saturday. He threatened legal action if any of his
clients were interfered with in future.
On Saturday, Carnegie representatives will attend many of the
unofficial hospitality functions which take place in city-centre hotels
and at venues around the Edinburgh stadium.
Carnegie, which is part of Glasgow Rangers' chairman David Murray's
business empire and which employs Scotland captain Gavin Hastings, has
also bought individual tickets on the black market. The SRU's
computerised ticket allocation scheme enables each ticket to be traced
to source.
After Saturday's sell-out game, Carnegie will deliver the evidence
gathered during the ''spying'' operation to the SRU. The identities of
the Scottish companies and organisations which purchased hospitality
packages from unofficial operators will be included in a report, and the
SRU will then decide whether to make them public.
The Herald understands that when a similar, but much smaller scale,
operation was carried out during the game against South Africa last
November, some high-profile companies, including at least one
multinational and two merchant banks, entertained clients to hospitality
packages with tickets bought on the black market.
Yesterday, Carnegie's marketing director, Mr Malcolm Brown, said that
the SRU ran the only official hospitality operation at Murrayfield, and
that ''pirate'' operators were costing the union hundreds of thousands
of pounds.
''What we are telling companies is that there is an official
hospitality set-up at Murrayfield Stadium where your tickets are
guaranteed. Opt for any other way and you could be taking a major risk
of being ejected from the stand.
''We are telling people that the money that they are spending -- and a
single Scottish firm might spend #3000 with a pirate operator -- is not
finding its way back into Scottish rugby.''
0 Mr Brown said the SRU had always maintained that ejection from the
stadium was an option, and this was still the case.
Last night, the latest Murrayfield initiative drew an angry reaction
from the former England and British Lions' prop forward Mike Burton,
whose Mike Burton Group is one of the world's biggest hospitality
package operators.
Mr Burton, who during his playing days was the first England
internationalist to be sent off for foul play, declared: ''I can't
believe you're saying this to me. Cloak and dagger stuff is it? Gavin
Hastings is going to go around on his tip-toes with a dagger is he? They
just want to stab people who are in competition with them. We are not
'pirates'. We are competitors and they are in exactly the same business
as us.
''The stand that the Scottish Rugby Union is taking is against
European law. I have already written and told it this. It has a
statutory duty to all other competitors in that market. We have no-one
at Murrayfield this weekend, but for future games, if our people are
interfered with then we will take the Scottish Rugby Union to court.''

TWELVE of the Western Isles Council's 30 members yesterday came out
against the proposed #70m superquarry at Lingerbay in South Harris in a
submission to the public inquiry.
The move confirms that support for the quarry has ebbed significantly
within the council since June 1993, when the vote in favour of a
planning application by Redland Aggregates was 24 to 3.
Last year's elections, however, saw 18 new councillors elected, many
harbouring doubts about the development.
One was Councillor Norman MacDonald, whose ward contains Lingerbay. He
said that he had been delighted by the action of his colleagues.
Although such opposition has grown, attempts to win the 20 votes
required to suspend standing orders in order to debate the issue once
again have failed.
The submission to the inquiry is in the name of Alasdair Nicolson, the
independent councillor for the Coll ward in Lewis. He said yesterday
that he and his colleagues were seeking ''genuine debate'' on the topic.
''When the council took a decision in June 1993 to have a mind to
grant planning permission, I opposed the development on the basis that
it was just too large, and I was not satisfied that sufficient research
had been done on the social or economic impact such a development would
have.''
In the submission, the dissident councillors argue that, when the
council made its decision, some important environmental reports were not
available. The councillors also dismissed attempts to label them as
''anti-jobs'' or ''enemies of the council''.
They remind the inquiry that both Labour and the SNP are opposed to
the quarry, and argue that many islanders are wary about the project.

AN animal handler who was attacked by a bear has failed in her claim
for #5000 damages.
A sheriff ruled yesterday that Miss Maureen Harkin was entirely to
blame for the incident because she broke the rules at the Cameron Bear
Park, on the shores of Loch Lomond.
Miss Harkin, 28, was suing Alloa Brewers, owners of the now-defunct
complex where she worked.
In his written judgment, issued yesterday at Dumbarton, Sheriff Tom
Scott said zoo manager Herbert Dornbrek, 50, had taken every precaution
to prevent such an incident happening.
The court heard that Miss Harkin, of Daligan Farm, Glen Fruin,
Dunbartonshire, was employed as a monkey handler. Her sister, Mrs Kate
Battersby, 26, was in charge of a bear. Miss Harkin took over when she
was off-duty.
On the day of the accident in December 1986, Miss Harkin went into the
bear's cage to feed it, despite the fact that Mrs Battersby was at work.
Mr Dornbrek had earlier set down rules saying that the bear's food
must only be put in its cage through a trap-door in a partition fence.
The court heard that Miss Harkin was trying to hand-feed the bear.
It suddenly grabbed her thighs, knocking her to the ground. The bear
sank its teeth into the woman's knee.
Mrs Battersby dashed into the cage and wrestled the bear away, dragged
Miss Harkin out, and slammed the door.
Miss Harkin was taken to the Vale of Leven Hospital, where her wound
was stitched.
Sheriff Scott said: ''In entering the cage, Miss Harkin failed to take
reasonable care for her safety and was in breach of specific
instructions from Mr Dornbrek. By failing to use the partition to
segregate the bear before putting in the food, she also failed to take
reasonable care.''
Miss Harkin said last night she might appeal, adding: ''I would love
to work with animals again, but this has wrecked my hopes because it
makes me look incompetent.''

DUFF House in Banff will open to the public later this year as a
country house art gallery after a #2.5m restoration.
The house, designed by William Adam in 1735 as a home for the local MP
William Duff, who later became the Earl of Fife, has been everything
from a hotel to a prisoner-of-war camp, and faced demolition 40 years
ago.
Disagreements between Adam and Duff led to a lengthy legal case. The
strain is thought to have contributed to Adam's death in 1748.
The bulk of the #2.5m cost of converting the house -- regarded as one
of Adam's finest achievements -- into a gallery has been met by Historic
Scotland, which will remain responsible for the fabric of the building.
The house will be furnished by the National Galleries of Scotland.
Banff and Buchan District Council will jointly be responsible for the
day-to-day management of the house, and Grampian Enterprise has
financially supported external work and landscaping.

SCOTTISH football clubs are unlikely to be involved in financial
irregularities such as illicit deals and tax evasion because most of
them operate on relatively tight budgets, it was claimed yesterday.
Mr Jim Farry, chief executive of the Scottish Football Association,
said the economics of the game in Scotland meant most clubs were
struggling financially to meet statutory requirements such as seating
regulations and would not be involved in such irregularities.
He was speaking after football authorities in England rejected calls
by Labour MP Kate Hoey for a public investigation into alleged
corruption.
The English Football Association and Premier League both welcomed
assurances from Sports Minister Ian Sproat that the Government has
confidence in football's governing bodies to investigate allegations of
under-the-counter deals and tax evasion.
The FA insisted Ms Hoey ''raised nothing new'' in the Commons demand.
The English FA said: ''We are content that a full inquiry is being
undertaken into a wide range of existing allegations. It would be wrong
to prejudge the outcome of the FA Premier League Commission.''
Ms Hoey used a short adjournment debate to demand that the Government
take action over ''bungs'', under-the-counter deals, and tax evasion by
some of Britain's top clubs.
Among the deals she questioned was the transfer of Teddy Sheringham
from Nottingham Forest to Tottenham when Brian Clough and England
manager Terry Venables were in charge of the clubs.
The Inland Revenue said yesterday it had been scrutinising football
clubs for some time and that, although tax inspectors from its special
compliance football section had until recently been concentrating on
Premiership teams, they have started investigating clubs in the lower
English leagues and in Scotland.
This extension of their inquiries was prompted by ''suspicions'' that
problems relating to unpaid taxes in the Premiership existed elsewhere,
and not by specific allegations.

PLANS for a multi-million pound food park, which will enable Glasgow
firms to meet EU directives, were unveiled yesterday.
The M8 FoodPark, based in the city's Port Dundas Business Park, offers
125,000sq ft of specialised industrial units designed to meet the
increasingly high standards of food manufacture.
The Glasgow Development Agency, Glasgow District Council, and the
private sector have invested #1.5m in research, development, and
clearing the 12-acre site. Building work on the site is expected to be
completed by the end of the year.
The units will then be available for sale or rent and will be tailored
to the occupier's requirements.
Two firms have already applied for planning permission. Ambassador
Foods is already based in Port Dundas but plans to move into the first
phase of the FoodPark, and P &amp; C Morris, a fish and game firm, will move
from Kinning Park to the site.

Television does no justice to a courtroom
NEVER mind the public right to know, the breakthrough of broadcasting
boundaries, or the whole spectacle's neatly ironic depiction of an
American dream turned nightmare: the best and most gratifying thing
about the Sky and BBC coverage of the O J Simpson trial is that it has
been stultifyingly, catatonically, almost hilariously boring.
I'm not advancing some sort of Andy Warholian Boring Is Beautiful
cultural aesthetic here: as someone who watches TV for a living, I
generally prefer not to be bored.
But this is boredom in the cause of virtue: with a bit of luck, it
might put people off the idea of televised trials altogether. If anthing
can do it, it will be the sight of the interminable delays, nitpicking,
and obscurity of a big American trial tricked out with all the
obfuscation and pettifogging that money can buy.
Take a look at the Simpson trial one night, if you have access to
satellite TV, and after that ask yourself whether you are any the wiser,
or even better informed, about the facts of the case (lawyers are
disqualified from taking this test, being brighter and more inured to
tedium than the rest of us). I don't think you will be. You will more
likely be asleep, or if conscious, vaguely ashamed of so signally
wasting your time.
But even if the Simpson trial were the most spellbinding forensic
spectacle since Marlene Dietrich took the stand in Witness For The
Prosecution, there would still be excellent reason not to screen it and
not to watch it. TV is intrinsically a medium of entertainment: to put a
real flesh-and-blood criminal trial on the same level of choice as soap
operas and hospital thrillers is to demean the process of law and the
dignity of the defendant.
In a criminal trial, be it ever so trivial, you have a man or woman,
very much like you or me, in disgrace. If convicted, he or she may go to
jail, will probably lose his or her job, and will forfeit his or her
good name among his family and friends and the community he or she lives
in. That's entertainment? I don't think so -- unless a car crash is
entertainment too, and if you've ever passed the scene of one you'll
know there are plenty of people who think it is.
We live in laisser-faire, libertarian times however, and many
broadcasters who ought to know better are willing to justify or condone
TV trials on the basis that a lot of people want to see them. That
argument is spinach.
It may sound uncomfortably elitist, coming from an educated gent and
media commentator, to say that people shouldn't be allowed to see what
they want, but most people want capital punishment, too, and they'd
probably tune in for a live broadcast from the execution shed at that.
If broadcasting is allowed to pander to the lowest common denominator,
it will be at a high cost to the national morale: that is why the BBC
was at its best when it was run by high-minded toffs who knew better
than the public what was good for them.
The best argument, to be fair, for televising criminal proceedings is
that they are already open to the public and that to put them on TV is
only expanding the principle that justice must be seen to be done.
Indeed it must; but is that not a right more honoured in the breach than
in the observance? A flying visit to Glasgow's sherif and district
courts to talk to some of the people who make a hobby out of upholding
this principle was, as you might expect, a fairly unedifying experience.
All of the public-gallery regulars I spoke to -- oddly enough for such
keen devotees of the right to know, none of them would give their names
-- seemed to regard it more as a species of free theatre.
''It's more exciting than TV, because it's real,'' said one elderly
woman who would have looked well beside the guillotine with a pair of
knitting needles. ''You learn a lot about justice and that,'' said a
middle-aged man who looked as if he wouldn't get lost in a jail. ''And
anyway, if they'd behaved themelves they wouldn't be in trouble in the
first place.''
Suppose it was you in the dock, I asked them. The answer was always
the same: ''It widny be me in the first place, son.''
One man, however, had something intelligent to say: ''You work for the
papers, right? A' the papers are full of court stories every day, so
whit dae you care anyway?''
He was right, of course. I'm not saying that trials are not legitimate
news, but there are too many minor cases reported in which the reporting
of the case is a far sorer punishment than the official one.
One thinks of middle-aged lady shoplifters, students caught with small
quantities of soft drugs, drunk and incapables: when such offenders are
fined or jailed they're supposed to be paying a debt to society, not to
the local newspaper.
This is a call for less curiosity about crime in the media, not more.
Before any news executive, from the Invertottie Howker to the News At
Ten, pubishes the details of a trial, he should think: is this in the
public interest or a cheap holiday in someone else's misery? Let the O J
Simpson trial be the high-water mark of prurience; let the two recent TV
series featuring excerpts from Scottish trials be the last -- in the
name of decency, pity, and love.

Sarajevo, Tuesday
FIGHTING raged unabated in Bosnia's Bihac enclave today as France and
Germany made new appeals for peace.
Hundreds of artillery shells and mortars were fired in Bihac on Monday
and this morning as Muslim-led Bosnian government troops fought rebel
Muslims who have allied themselves to the Serbs.
Meanwhile UN peacekeepers began an operation today to evacuate nearly
200 sick Muslims and Serbs from the eastern enclave of Gorazde.
UN spokesman Gary Coward said a convoy of ambulances protected by
Canadian troops was on its way from Gorazde to Sarajevo carrying 94
wounded Muslims. More evacuations are planned.
''It's looking good,'' he said.
During a brief visit to the Bosnian capital Sarajevo German Foreign
Minister Klaus Kinkel urged the Serbs to accept the five-power ''Contact
Group'' peace plan.
At the same time French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe called for a
''last-chance'' international conference on the former Yugoslavia. He
warned that the alternative was ''Bosnia in flames again''.
However Bosnian Vice President Ejup Ganic was not enthusiastic. He
said the Contact Group must persuade Bosnian Serb leader Radovan
Karadzic to accept the peace plan before there is another conference.
Kinkel said it was time for the Bosnian Serbs to accept the peace plan
drawn up by Britain, the United States, Russia, France, and Germany.
''Karadzic is the only one so far who has refused to accept the peace
plan and I appeal to him accept the peace plan,'' he said.
Kinkel, who also visited Zagreb, said he had urged Croatian President
Franjo Tudjman to reverse his decision to throw out UN peacekeeping
troops after their mandate in Croatia expires on March 31.--Reuter.

Moscow, Tuesday
RUSSIAN ultra-nationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky has run into
trouble with his fellow MPs amid reports of him enthusing about group
sex in a Playboy interview.
The head of the Duma, or Russian Parliament, said that Zhirinovsky's
behaviour at the Council of Europe parliamentary assembly was
''absolutely impermissible''.
''There are certain limits which a politician must not cross,'' said
Ivan Rybkin of a clash between Zhirinovsky and Russia's human rights
commissioner in a debate on the war in Chechnya. Zhirinovsky had yelled
so loudly that he was almost expelled.
Meanwhile, Playboy's March edition reveals that Zhirinovsky urged a
female interviewer and her young female translator to undress and let
his bodyguards caress them while he watched.
Asked if he'd ever had sex with four people, he replied, ''Of course.
I love to watch more.''
Sex, he observed, was ''best when it's with a group''.
Zhirinovsky also suggested that women pushed men into war by denying
them sexual favours: ''If each Chechen would have a woman, there would
be no war. That's why you're the source of war on the planet,'' he
said.--AP/Reuter.

The American public is becoming increasingly disenchanted with the
antics of the Simpson trial lawyers
WITH America's much-vaunted ''Trial of the Century'' likely to last
several more months, it already appears an early victim is legal
fairness and ethics. The double murder trial of former sports star O J
Simpson has barely advanced beyond opening statements. But courtroom
manoeuvering has been so blatant and disturbing, news commentators
struck a chord when they paraphrased Shakespeare recently: ''First,
let's kill the lawyers.''
Judge Lance Ito's decision to allow prosecutors to present their
opening statement again yesterday, because of what he described as
''unfair'' defence tactics, was unprecedented. Even in America, where
trials are often lengthy, his ruling under-scores just how bizarre the
celebrity case is becoming.
Public interest is being increasingly tested too as the drama is
interrupted yet again by complex legal proceedings. Since the 12-person
jury was first seated nine days ago in the Los Angeles Superior Court,
the trial has been halted twice for a total of two days.
Even before the defence misconduct last week, an opinion poll
suggested 95% of Americans want less news about Simpson, accused of
murdering his ex-wife Nicole and her friend Rob Goldman on June 12. And
the trial may now exceed initial estimates of four to six months'
duration and cost of $3.25m.
Adding to public ambivalence is Ito's allowing television only a
static view of the courtroom, after an alternate juror was mistakenly
shown on TV briefly last week. The resulting wide-angle shot, without
close-ups of any participants, is so dull that radio is the medium of
choice.
As this week's proceedings opened, without the jury present Judge Ito
blasted lead defence lawyer Johnnie Cochran for trying an ''unfair
tactical advantage''. Ito said Cochran had knowingly hidden from
prosecutors the identity of 14 witnesses, including a woman who
allegedly saw four men fleeing the murder scene.
Simpson, 47, has pled not guilty, saying he is the wrong man.
Withholding such information in a criminal case is illegal in
California, despite the popular conception that surprise is the stuff of
courtroom drama -- as in television's famous court drama, Perry Mason.
Ito later instructed jurors to ignore mention of the 14 witnesses.
Some seasoned observers say the defence may have planted a vital seed of
doubt. Since any verdict must be unanimous, the defence need only
convince one juror that Simpson may not be guilty.
''They did it in their opening statement because they thought they
could get away with it,'' says retired Los Angeles Superior Court judge
Eli Chernow. Even one of Simpson's own lawyers thought Cochran's tactics
too ''blatantly unethical'', says Newsweek, quoting an un-named defence
source.
''The defence probably knew that some of these witnesses were
turkeys,'' says former federal prosecutor Joseph Russionello. ''And they
knew they were not actually ever going to call them.'' The woman who
allegedly saw the four men has been sued 24 times and is being probed
for fraud, prosecutor Christopher Darden has since noted.
Yet attitudes can seem casual or hypocritical even in a murder trial.
After Cochran was reprimanded by Ito, he said with cool confidence: ''I
don't think the court will shoot me for that.'' Ito's reply was
unusually stern: ''Don't tempt me, Mr Cochran!''
Indeed Cochran is known for courtroom demeanour. ''Johnnie Cochran
oozes grace and charm and wit, and he can mesmerise a jury,'' says
University of California law professor, Peter Arenella. ''He is capable
of charming a snake, and he has certainly charmed Judge Ito.'' Los
Angeles defence lawyer Roger Cossack agrees, ''Johnnie Cochran does seem
to own Judge Ito.''
But Cossack also says prosecutors over-reacted to Cochran's ploy,
allowing him to put them on the defensive. Instead they should have
implied they were not perturbed and that the new witnesses were
meaningless.
Attorneys in the case often bemoan the intense publicity.
Defence lawyer F Lee Bailey recently blasted the media for, he said,
sullying his client's name around the world. Yet friction had exploded
between Bailey and fellow defence lawyer Robert Shapiro after
allegations that Bailey was trying to destroy Shapiro's reputation --
with damaging leaks to the media.
And if Ito is seen as especially harsh with prosecutors, he is viewed
as even more so with lead prosecutor Marcia Clark. He typically appears
to over-react with female lawyers, say critics.
''Every time Marcia Clark stands up, his tone and his demeanor
instantly change,'' says law professor Laurie Levenson. ''It's such a
shocking contrast to Johnnie Cochran.''
A large majority of Americans have consistently thought Simpson
guilty. But a new Newsweek poll indicates that 31% believe the defence
performed better in the opening statements, compared with 26% favouring
prosecutors.

HUNDREDS of thousands of people were evacuated from their homes
yesterday as floods swept across northern Europe.
Worst hit was Holland where the incessant rain threatened to overwhelm
the country's vital dike defence system.
In Scotland, many roads were affected by heavy rain or snow.
Throughout Britain, many rivers were on the point of bursting their
banks and some did overflow.
The surging floodwaters forced Holland to organise its biggest
civilian evacuation in more than 40 years.
Thousands of soldiers were helping with the evacuation and rescue
operation in the east of the country, including more than 160 British
soldiers from the RAF Regiment based at Laarbruch on the Dutch-German
border.
The Dutch Government is desperate to avoid a repeat of the great
floods of February 1953 when more than 1800 people died after sea-walls
collapsed along the southern province of Zeeland.
While there have been no deaths reported in connection with the new
Dutch floods, at least 27 people have died elsewhere on the Continent in
the worst floods this century.
Conditions in Germany were improving slightly yesterday. The level of
the Rhine, which reached a record high in Cologne earlier this week, was
continuing to fall slowly every hour. The floods, which began in Germany
last week, had submerged large parts of Cologne's old town after
spilling over barriers.
The Government pledged financial help for thousands of flood victims
but officials said residents in three western states faced another week
with their riverside homes under water.
It has become increasingly clear that decades of forcing the Rhine
into an ever-tighter strait-jacket had turned it into a massive funnel
that could easily overflow.
''We have been raping nature for 40 years,'' said Klaudia Martini,
Environment Minister in the Rhineland-Palatinate state. ''The Rhine is
showing us this was wrong.''
Since the 1830s, the Rhine has been straightened, cutting 50 miles off
its length. Melting Alpine snows and rains now takes just 30 hours to
rush from Basel to the south-west German city of Karlsruhe, half the
time it took to meander through former wetlands.
In France, the Seine was down slightly but the Meuse in the north-east
gained about six inches overnight. In the town of Charleville-Mezieres
on the Meuse, the hospital had to be evacuated. In nearby Givet, the
inmates of an old people's home were transferred to a military barracks.
Prime Minister Edouard Balladur toured one of the worst-hit areas in
the north-east. Balladur, who is running for president, flew over the
Ardennes where the Meuse and its tributaries have burst their banks,
stranding farms, factories, and houses.
The Government has announced emergency aid for businesses and promised
to declare a natural disaster to guarantee insurance cover.
Relatives of a Scotsman missing in the French floods yesterday watched
with apprehension the devastation on television. Mr Alex Mudie, 49, a
caretaker from Braco, Perthshire, has not been seen since Tuesday of
last week when his moped was found washed into the River Auln in
northern France where he was working for a holiday cottage company.
Yesterday, his sister, Mrs Nessie Nelson, 53, said the family would
cling to hope until her brother's body was found.
''We've seen the floods on TV and I suppose there is not much chance.
We can only wait and hope,'' said Mrs Nelson, of Dunblane.
In Belgium, floods began subsiding yesterday but the Government said
that with more rain forecast the crisis would not be over at least until
Friday.
In Scotland, many rivers were swollen by a combination of snow melting
on the hills and heavy rainfall. Many roads were hit by flooding or snow
during the day.
Several roads remained closed last night. In Grampian, the B974
Banchory to Fettercairn and the B976 Crathie to Gairnshiel both remained
blocked by snow, but the A939 Corgarff to Ballater route was re-opened.
The A821 Aberfoyle to Callander road in Central region was also closed
because of snow. In the Borders, the A698 Kelso to Jedburgh road was
shut because of flooding.
In Dumfriesshire, the River Nith rose 10ft during Monday night and
flooded hundreds of acres of farmland. The Whitesands area of Dumfries
was under several feet of water.
Elsewhere in Britain, soldiers helped with sandbagging in the Hexham
area of Northumberland after the River Tyne overflowed its banks, and
the National Rivers Authority reported widespread flooding throughout
Cumbria and North Lancashire.
The Army said about 30 soldiers based near Hexham were assisting flood
relief operations around the town. Another 200 were on standby to help
if needed.
Three stranded motorists were winched by helicopter from the roofs of
their vehicles after heavy downpours of rain and thawing snow caused
severe flooding in parts of North Yorkshire. Flood warnings have been
issued for rivers in many other areas.
Climate experts said they believed the reason for the floods across
Europe was because conditions had been so mild.
Mr Malcolm Brooks, spokesman for the Hadley Centre for Climate Change
at Bracknell, Berkshire, said: ''Rain which would have normally turned
to snow and frozen on higher ground has come down as rain instead. Snow
and ice lock the water in but, because it has been so warm, any snow
around has melted and run off in the rivers, causing flooding.''
Meanwhile, new figures released by the Met Office show its forecasters
are exceeding the accuracy target imposed by the Government.

It was dubbed the 'Trial of the Century' but, as Douglas Thompson
reports from Los Angeles, the O J Simpson hearing has become a showbiz
circus
THEY keep calling it the ''Trial of the Century'' but what it is is a
trial of today's values and the Superman ethos of truth, justice and the
American Way. Sadly, in the case of O J Simpson there are no supermen or
superwomen. All involved are tarnished goods just like the society that
is judging them. What is concerning is the assumption that Simpson is
guilty of killing his wife and another man but will go free because of
media pressure and his own celebrity.
There is this incredible notion that because no-one -- other than a
dog -- witnessed Simpson allegedly brutally murdering his wife Nicole
and her friend Ronald Goldman who was tragically in the wrong place at
the very wrong time there is no case to answer.
But killers don't act in public, do they? As any follower of real-life
and fictional courtroom drama knows it is the evidence, even if it is
circumstantial, which does or doesn't prove the case. Murder does not
have to be witnessed to be proven. Well, that was the way it was. O J
Simpson and the carnival around him have changed the rules. This is an
altogether different take on LA Law.
In recent times we have seen severe sentences reduced and overturned
in the British courts where people branded as guilty are now judged
innocent. With O J Simpson it is the opposite. Without a confession
there is no absolute certainty of his guilt but a straw poll of lawyers
here indicates indicates that if he was not who he is he would already
be waiting to hear the cyanide pellets popping in the gas chamber at San
Quentin Penitentiary. ''It's terrible for me to admit,'' a Los Angeles
Superior Court judge told me before sighing, ''It looks as if O J will
buy his way out of this.''
But freedom will cost many millions of dollars and this sports hero
turned television commentator and absurd if popular actor will be
bankrupt? Not a bit of it. Plans are already in motion for O J to walk
out of the grey brick downtown Los Angeles court-house and do a ''live''
TV interview.
On camera he will tell his story on cable TV. Viewers will have to pay
between $5 and $7.50 each to watch as in a pay-per-view big boxing match
or other major sporting event. Conservatively they say here that he will
bank upwards of $10m.
This is the judicial Olympics taking place in ludicrous circumstances
circled by streets driven by avarice, Porsches, Rolls-Royces and lawyers
who still live and bill at mid-1980s prices. The LA/OJ combination is a
frightening game of surreal Scrabble. The winning words, of course,
being Not Guilty.
This is a land of Oz and there may be mudslides and earthquakes and
all the other plagues of a Sodom society but to the residents what
overcomes all of it is if you are walking the yellow brick road of
celebrity. Your face and name and clout and ''Q'' rating -- how much
advertisers will pay to promote their products on TV while you are on
the air -- means everything.
It is in such circumstances that the O J trial is the only show in
town. It began as the legal equivalent of an opening night on Broadway.
After months of backstage manoeuvring and dress rehearsals the lead
players could strut their stuff.
If this was not such an obscene marathon, a daily Technicolor eyeful
of the best but mostly worst of the American justice system, you might
have found some joy by the look on the faces of 47-year-old Simpson's
defence team when it appeared Judge Lance Ito would not allow their
''act'' to be televised. They could not disguise their despair and then
the anger.
It appeared they would have been less upset if their client had been
found guilty of knifing to death his former wife, Nicole, 35, and her
friend, restaurant waiter Ronald Goldman, 25, on June 12 last year. The
bodies were found outside Mrs Simpson's home on the west side of Los
Angeles. It was high drama.
But that was swiftly surpassed by the strange, leisurely car chase in
which the California Highway Patrol -- and a fleet of media cars beneath
a sky-clouded by TV news helicopters -- pursued Simpson and his white
Ford Bronco along the Los Angeles freeways. It was a bizarre event
watched by 93 million television viewers in America alone. That was
enough for two television films and 16 TV movie proposals. And that was
just the first act.
The Big Carnival -- the media Ace in the Hole -- began. Nicole's
parents were interviewed on prime-time TV. Then it was the turn of
Ronald Goldman's family. Then Simpson's children from his first marriage
went ''live''. His mother, Eunice and sister Shirley make their TV
appearances. Paula Barbieri, who was Simpson's girlfriend before the
double murders, appeared in Playboy magazine.
Last October Simpson's fitness-for-men video was released. Nicole's
apartment was put on the market for near $1m. Judge Ito began a six-part
interview with KCBS-TV in Los Angeles. Nicole's family accepted $50,000
from ''No Excuses'' jeans -- they are to set up a foundation in her
name. Simpson supporters set up a 1-900-RESPECT telephone line so that
fans of the fallen idol can leave a message -- at $1.95 a minute.
By the time the trial proper got going last month Simpson's book, I
Want To Tell You A Story, which was dictated from prison, had been
published.
Everyone associated with this case -- not since the Lindbergh
kidnapping has a crime so captivated the American imagination -- is
getting or will receive their 15 minutes of fame. And it will be a
lucrative quarter of an hour.
The first star off the block was Robert Shapiro who heads the Simpson
defence team. His reward in legal fees will be in the millions of
dollars whether his client walks free from the ninth-floor courtroom of
Los Angeles Superior Court or not.
Not only has he hired his ''dream team'' of lawyers to defend Simpson,
he has also employed the services of Ed Hookstratten who is one of this
town's most respected agent-lawyers. Hookstratten's task is to deal with
Shapiro's book offers and discuss possibilities about Shapiro becoming a
television talk show host. Such is the interest in the trial that
Shapiro has become as well, if not a better-known face, than President
Clinton.
His offices are on the 19th floor of a tower block at the junction of
the aptly named Galaxy Avenue and the Avenue of the Stars in Century
City. The veteran actress Polly Bergen tells the story of the evening
she and the novelist Judith Krantz and friends, including Shapiro, 52,
walked into the Pinot Bistro restaurant in Beverly Hills. ''I've gone to
places with Cary Grant, Fred Astaire, and Clark Gable and I've never
seen what happened here.
''The room literally stopped. It was absolutely extraordinary. In this
town everyone is used to celebrities and is much more blase but you
absolutely knew that every eye was staring at him.''
Well, Clarence Darrow did not have a TV audience of tens of millions
watching him every day. That said, Darrow did not have his photograph
taken by photographers like Avedon or Annie Leibovitz and stare out at
you from the perfumed pages of glossy magazines.
Shapiro, like the rest of his team, is a sharp dresser. Image is all.
Prosecutor Marcia Clark, a former dancer, has taken acting lessons to
better present her case which she does like a schoolmarm finding it
difficult to tell the jury all the awful things Simpson is guilty of.
But with aplomb she does, she does.
When O J Simpson is brought to court from Los Angeles County Jail he
is wearing manacles and prison blues. By the time he reaches his seat in
court he is in pressed Armani or Lavin.
All dress for effect in this tale of celebrity, love, sex, brutality,
race, bloody murder, obsession and what many believed is a vain attempt
at getting justice. O J Simpson, guilty or innocent, is now an industry.
Just think what has gone on in the past 31 years since President
Kennedy was shot in Dallas . . . it has been an ongoing cottage industry
of conspiracy theories, all of which have been for sale in books or
film.
No matter what the criminal justice system determines happened to
Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman on June 12, 1994, there will
always be people who will dispute the verdict.
If Simpson is convicted there will be the books and the tapes to
convince us that he could not possibly be guilty. If acquitted similar
books and tapes will be produced to show that he must have done it.
If it sounds absurd to equate the killing of JFK with the murder trial
of a celebrity sportsman you only have to spend moments around the
antics of the Los Angeles Superior Court to understand. This is another
moment of American history of which no-one involved wants to let go.
The trial of O J Simpson with its vast cast of characters will be
discussed for years. As they say on Broadway, it's one of those plays
that will run and run. Of course, that only happens when the audience
wants it to.
At this early stage of the trial, which may go on for as much as six
months, most observers believe Simpson will be acquitted; the defence
just have to convince one of the 12 jurors, eight of whom are black
women, that there is reasonable doubt -- for a Guilty verdict must be
unanimous.
Often in these celebrity trials the victims are forgotten but not so
with The People v O J Simpson. Robert Shapiro was at a Beverly Hills
restaurant the other night and a persistent waiter insisted on meeting
him.
''I've just been cast as Ron Goldman in the TV movie of the case,'' he
told Shapiro, who congratulated the young man on his good luck . . .

THE Edinburgh Medal, awarded for outstanding scientific achievement
for the benefit of mankind, will this year be presented to Sir John
Crofton who developed the international standard treatment for
tuberculosis.
Dublin-born Sir John, 82, led a team of physicians and bacteriologists
who in 1954 devised the first totally effective drug therapy against TB,
the world's greatest killer.
Previous attempts to kill the tubercule bacillus by using individual
drugs had failed, often leaving patients resistant to any therapy. The
Edinburgh team used three drugs simultaneously and achieved 100%
success.
Their results were initially met with disbelief but, with support from
the Pasteur Institute in Paris, they were vindicated in the first
international trial of any treatment.
Sir John said last night of his award: ''I'm flabbergasted. I thought
there must be a clerical error or they must have muddled it up with
people who had not paid their council tax.
''Really, it was very much a team effort by all my colleagues. They
all contributed at least as much as I did.''
The medal and the prize of #5000 will be presented by the Lord Provost
in April as part of the Edinburgh International Science Festival.
The citation refers to the broader achievement of the Edinburgh TB
team in developing public health medicine and their care and compassion
for patients of all classes.

<HEADLINE>Joint bid to win slice of #2000m schemes. English firm in move to capture water contracts</HEADLINE>

AN English water company whose bills to consumers since privatisation
have soared above inflation has given the Government's controversial
plans for Build, Own, and Operate water and sewerage projects in
Scotland a massive fillip.
Northumbrian Water has signed a deal with Clydebank-based John Brown
Engineering to bid for contracts worth an estimated #2000m under the
Build, Own, and Operate scheme, known as BOO.
The alliance is the first acknowledgement of private interests joining
forces to challenge the public sector's absolute role in providing water
services in Scotland.
Widespread political and public opposition is guaranteed, given the
support for water remaining in local authority control.
Scottish Office Ministers, who have identified 15 potential BOO
schemes, insist that the schemes will provide value for money by
attracting private investment for desperately needed sewerage schemes to
meet European strictures.
However, councils and opposition MPs believe local authorities could
do coastal clean-up jobs better and cheaper.
Northumbrian Water and JBE confirmed yesterday that bids were likely
for a large number of sewage treatment contracts in Scotland and the
Irish Republic, due to be advertised over the next few months.
The contracts will be worth thousands of millions of pounds, according
to Northumbrian Water, which wants to operate the plants, with JBE
involved in design and construction.
It is understood that the consortium's interest lies in large capacity
sewage treatment plants in ''sensitive areas'', especially Strathclyde.
Although the Labour-controlled regional council will cease to exist
from April next year, it needs to build a #110m works at Dalmuir,
Glasgow, and a #15m plant at Greenan, Ayr, to meet European and
Government legislation by 1998.
Strathclyde currently faces a #300m shortfall in funding such work.
Both companies are aware of Scottish support for public ownership of
water, but insist ''control'' will remain in the public sector because
councils will commission the work and set standards to be achieved.
They are relying on their track records as water and engineering
companies to sway public opinion towards Government policy on private
sector input.
However, the SNP's water spokesman, Mr Andrew Welsh, countered: ''I
don't care where Build, Own, and Operate companies come from. The people
of Scotland want water services in the public sector, owned, run, and
operated by local authorities.''
He claimed that the Government, having created three water quangos to
replace councils next year, was now forcing the local authorities along
the road to BOO schemes. ''It is a form of back-door privatisation.''
He said that surveys throughout Scotland showed BOO to be more
expensive to taxpayers than traditional methods of financing water and
sewage services.
A spokesman for Northumbrian Water, which covers one of England's most
staunch Labour areas, confirmed that its average bills had jumped from
#90 to #185 since 1989 -- with annual rises of 6% or 7% above the
inflation rate.
He also conceded that the independent Office of Water Services had now
limited increases over the next five years to 2.5% above inflation,
although Northumbrian's charges remain the fourth lowest of the 10
English and Welsh privatised water companies.
The spokesman admitted that any project in Scotland would lead to
increases in bills. He said: ''At the end of the day, the work has to be
done. That work, to improve services and create a better environment,
has to be paid for.
''We appreciate water is contentious in Scotland, but we also think
its people should not have bathing standards less than those that apply
in Europe.''
John Brown Engineering, which designed and built the UK's largest
treatment plant at Hayle, Cornwall, expects to bid for 10 of the 15 BOO
schemes which will be subject to pre-qualification exercises.
A spokesman felt that the private sector could satisfy capital
programme requirements to upgrade Scotland's sewerage network. Of the
looming political storm, he argued that Scotland would do itself a
disservice by not responding to foreign competition for the projects. At
least two French firms will bid.
He added that the work would have substantial job implications for JBE
and Northumbrian Water.
The Scottish Office was unaware of any other formal agreements among
UK companies, but said similar proposals to form consortia were in the
pipeline.

DETAILS of the recent floods which hit Strathclyde went before the
region yesterday, with a warning about the future.
The director of water services, Mr Ernest Chambers, pointed out that
time constraints on reorganisation of local government meant it would
not be practicable for the region to undertake any further large flood
prevention works.
He urged that detailed reports should go to the new Joint Working
Groups which would oversee transfer of regional functions to unitary
authorities. These reports would highlight both the overall statutory
position the new councils would inherit, and details of particular areas
of concern within each new council's boundaries.
Mr Chambers pointed out, in his report, that last December's floods
resulted from rain ''of an intensity and duration never previously
recorded''.
He noted there were cases where planning authorities had not given
sufficient weight to comments regarding flood risk to proposed
developments.
The events of last December had highlighted the potential
consequences, he added.
The current legal framework regulating responsibility for maintenance
of watercourses was complex and unique to Scotland, he pointed out. A
number of parties had an interest or legal responsibilities in relation
to maintenance of watercourses, completion of flood prevention works,
and provision of early warning systems. These included riparian owners,
regional councils, river purification boards, and planning authorities.

A POLICE officer was convicted yesterday of assaulting a prisoner with
his truncheon.
PC Harry Anderson, 39, was fined #200 when found guilty of assaulting
Mr Nicholas Hill, 21.
Outside the court, Anderson, an officer with 10 years' service,
admitted: ''I would accept my career to be at an end; that's the most
severe punishment.''
However, he added that he intended to lodge an appeal.
Earlier, he told the court he hit Mr Hill with his baton after being
knocked to the ground and assaulted by the handcuffed prisoner.
Mr Hill, 21, of Barnhill, Dundee, had been taken into Carnoustie
police station with his girlfriend Kerry Hopkins after an incident in
the town on December 8, 1991.
The prisoner was knocked unconscious by a blow while in the cells and
required the 10 stitches.
Anderson told Arbroath Sheriff Court his intention was to separate Mr
Hill and his girlfriend from the same cell.
He said: ''As they were separated, Hill attacked me, flailed out with
his hands in front of him, and I was knocked to the ground.
''I got to my feet and as I did so I drew my baton and hit Mr Hill
once. I had been overpowered and he was continuing to come at me.''
Mr Hill told the court: ''I know I was struggling but I didn't deserve
a blow like that.''
PC Gair Forbes, 25, who was with Anderson at the time, told the court
how he moved to restrain Mr Hill by putting his arms around his waist.
The officer said he could not recollect Anderson being knocked to the
ground.

<TEXT>
WILDLIFE enthusiasts in Renfrewshire hope to block a private housing
development because the site is home to a colony of bats.
The conservationists, who have formed an action group to fight the
developers, say the bats -- protected under recent legislation -- roost
in trees on the land and that under European law they cannot be
disturbed.
Euro MP Hugh McMahon has been consulted by the protesters and he
confirmed that bats -- an endangered species -- had to be safeguarded
under the Bonn Agreement of 1991 and the European Habitat Directive
which contains further protection clauses.
Planning officials of Renfrew district are consulting Scottish Natural
Heritage for guidance.
The plan to erect up to 50 houses at the Craigends site in Houston,
adjoining a heavily wooded area, follows outline permission being
granted eight years ago.
O'Brien Homes has submitted detailed plans for the site and an
additional application for permission to fell a number of trees, and
both are being examined by the local authority.
An official of the council said Scottish Natural Heritage had
confirmed there were bats in the area, but the agency was still trying
to pinpoint the exact roosting and feeding locations.
She added: ''Anyone who puts bats or their habitat at risk will be
breaking the law. The matter is still under consideration and further
consultations with the various interested parties are taking place.''
Councillor Thomas Spalding, the district representative for Houston,
said he sympathised with residents.
He added: ''The action group have video evidence showing bats in the
area and the secretary of the group has counted as many as 47 bats in
the eaves of his house, which is just opposite the site earmarked for
this development.''

Paris, Tuesday
MODERN farming and creeping urbanisation have aggravated floods in
northern Europe and may make such disasters more likely in future,
experts say.
Deforestation, ever-bigger fields, pesticides, efforts to contain
rivers in strait-jackets and more tarmac and concrete have made the land
less absorbent, making rains run off dangerously fast into rivers.
''This is not just a Dutch problem. It's a European governmental
problem,'' Dutch Environment Minister Margreet de Boer said in a radio
interview.
''We have in places lost the absorbent effect of the land so the water
comes far quicker to us.'' The Netherlands is mounting its biggest
civilian evacuation in 40 years.
''We have been raping nature for 40 years,'' said Ms Klaudia Martini,
Environment Minister in Rhineland-Palatinate state in Germany where the
Rhine and middle stretches of the Mosel overflow. ''The Rhine is showing
us this was wrong.''
Since the 1830s, the Rhine has been straightened, cutting 50 miles off
its length. Melting Alpine snows and rains now take just 30 hours to
rush from Basel to Karlsruhe, half the time it took to meander through
former wetlands.
In the Ardennes region of northern France, where the Meuse flows
before cutting along the Belgian border and reaching the sea in the
Netherlands as the Maas river, 2.5 times the normal rainfall for January
has fallen this month. In Brittany, rainfall was the heaviest in 150
years.
''With these exceptional amounts of rain, floods would be
inevitable,'' said Mr Patrice Guyot, head of the office of flood
prevention at the French Environment Ministry.
''Human activities have aggravated the effect, but they aren't the
main cause. It may sound obvious, but the main cause is the rain,'' he
said.
But experts agree that human activity has made northern Europe more
susceptible to floods.
The French Environment Minister, Mr Michel Barnier, urged better use
of European Union agriculture funds ''to protect the banks of rivers and
to make sure that the wetlands are also protected''.
He told the environment committee of the European Parliament in
Brussels today: ''We also have to look at the poor use made of our water
courses'' in an assault on floods.
In France alone, some 480,000 miles of hedgerows, which once helped
brake the run-off of rain waters, have disappeared since the 1960s.
Pesticides have chased away moles and worms which once helped keep the
soil porous like a sponge.
Meanwhile, the jungle of concrete and tarmac across northern Europe --
in roads, car parks, factories -- has speeded the flow of water into
rivers in urban areas.
Yet in other ways, flood protection is far better than it used to be
-- most obviously, two-thirds of the Netherlands has been reclaimed over
the centuries from below sea level.
Rains have mocked Europe in the past. Thousands died in France in 1315
and 1692. In 1910 the Seine broke its banks, flooding much of Paris and
wetting the feet of the Eiffel Tower. -- Reuter.

A STORM of criticism broke around the Government yesterday after it
announced that Scottish councils were to be allowed to spend #541m next
year on their own housing stock and to pay private owners' improvement
grants.
The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities claimed housing
investment was being cut by 11% in real terms, while Shelter and the
Liberal Democrats warned of more homelessness.
The Housing Minister, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, insisted however
that the total represented a substantial continuing level of support.
He said about #40m could be invested in Community Care, while spending
onhomelessness, condensation, and dampness could be maintained.
Renfrew and Strathkelvin will get #2.5m for flood damage to council
housing.
But Cosla's Labour president, Rosemary McKenna, said that, when the
Community Care allocation and the resources for flood damage were
removed, the allocation was 11% down on last year's sum.
She said the cutback ''demolished any hope of improving conditions in
housing with disastrous consequences for many of the most vulnerable in
our society''.
Shelter spokesman Gavin Corbett said it was unbelievable at a time of
record homelessness and appalling housing conditions that housing
investment could be slashed so dramatically.
The Scottish Liberal Democrats' leader, Mr Jim Wallace, claimed:
''This is one of the most short-sighted cuts in public spending that can
be made which could condemn even more people to homelessness.''
Glasgow District Council said its #92m allocation for council house
investment would allow improvement work to continue, but the housing
development committee convener, David Brown, was highly critical of the
#24.1m allocated to private improvement grants in the city, warning that
cuts of this nature could lead to demolition of parts of the city's
tenement heritage.
Edinburgh District Council's housing convener, Mary Mulligan, said the
city's allocation of #18.9m would allow the council to fulfil some of
its commitments to the citizens of Edinburgh.
But she stressed it would not meet all the demands on the housing
department, including the need for new housing and renovation.

<TEXT>
ANGRY Mirror Group pensioners, deprived of #400m by the late Robert
Maxwell, have demanded the same legal aid rights as the media tycoon's
two sons.
The protest followed the granting of #4m in legal aid to Ian and Kevin
Maxwell, facing fraud charges.
Mr Ken Trench, chairman of the pensioners' action group, said that
20,000 Maxwell pensioners were having to finance their own action in the
courts to get back some of the money owed to them.
The group has received no financial assistance in a lengthy legal
campaign which already has swallowed up a further #15m from the
remaining MGN pension fund.
Mr Trench told BBC Radio 4's World at One: ''It is rubbing salt in the
wounds when we hear the Maxwell brothers have received #4m in legal
aid.''
He warned of the danger of existing funds being used up in fees for
the complex action, and certain groups ''could well have their pensions
stopped completely''.
Mr Trench called on the Government to intervene and the Shadow legal
affairs spokesman, Mr Paul Boateng, said the award to the Maxwells, at a
time when legal aid rights for ordinary people were being squeezed,
brought ''the whole system into disrepute''.
The Maxwells' case has already cost #829,377 in the magistrates'
courts and payments on account up to November 1994 in the Crown Court of
#3,198,631.
* Smokers are to be granted legal aid to sue tobacco companies, a
health group announced yesterday.
Limited cash help will be given for the first legal steps which could
lead to court actions for damages, according to Action on Smoking and
Health.
The smokers allege the companies deceived them by claiming there was
no proof smoking caused diseases and that it was not addictive.

A WEEK after two Bob Dylan shows in Edinburgh's Playhouse sold out
within hours of tickets having gone on sale, it was announced yesterday
that the gnarled 53-year-old pioneer of poetic folk-rock will be playing
his third Scottish show, at Glasgow's SECC, on April 9.
This date follows hard on the heels of Dylan's Playhouse appearances
on April 6 and 7, and will be the concluding show in his 10-show UK
tour, which begins in Brighton on March 26 and visits Cardiff, London,
Birmingham, and Manchester.
While Dylan's last stage appearance in Edinburgh has been reckoned to
have taken place in 1966, when he was indisputably closer to the height
of his powers, he has been a much more recent visitor to Glasgow, having
appeared there in 1989 and 1991.
A new album, Bob Dylan Unplugged, will be released before his Scottish
visit. Now if Dylan could only craft a decent all-new album, everything
would be dandy. Not that his legions of fervent devotees would agree
that it's been 20 years since he last recorded an LP worth listening to
all the way through, of course.
Isn't it a bit sad that so many such folk seem in need of a weatherman
to tell them which way the wind blows, as someone -- can't remember
exactly who -- once said. . .

A SHERIFF has accused one of Scotland's busiest criminal lawyers of
''professional misconduct'' in a scathing 44-page written judgment which
he is sending to the Law Society of Scotland.
In his judgment, Sheriff Richard Davidson describes the conduct of
solicitor Michael Short in the witness-box as ''wholly unprofessional,
dishonest, and cowardly''.
Describing Mr Short as a witness without ''credibility or
reliability'', Sheriff Davidson goes on to accuse him of professional
misconduct over a ''botched attempt to discredit a witness'' by accusing
her of fraud without any basis.
The sheriff also reveals that he is taking the unusual step of
forwarding a copy of his judgment to the Law Society of Scotland ''for
their information''.
Sheriff Davidson was giving judgment in an action raised by Ms
Jacqueline Stephen, a 25-year-old law student, who worked part-time for
Mr Short.
Ms Stephen alleged that Mr Short had sacked her in breach of contract
and reneged on a promise to lend her money to allow her to pay
university fees.
Ms Stephen started work for Mr Short, the senior partner at Bruce
Short and Co, of Dundee, as a precognition officer in January 1991.
She claimed that over the summer of that year she came to an agreement
with Mr Short that he would lend her the #5000 a year required for two
years to allow her to complete a law degree.
Ms Stephen approached the Clydesdale Bank for a loan in August 1991,
and was asked for a letter from her employers confirming their intention
of paying her fees on a loan basis while she worked 16 hours over
weekends for #3.50 per hour.
In the absence of Mr Short, a salaried partner at Bruce Short and Co,
Mr Paul Parker-Smith, signed a letter to the bank, confirming the
arrangement on August 23, 1991.
Ms Stephen duly obtained a bank loan for living expenses and started
her law course at Dundee University.
On February 12, 1992, Mr Short sacked her and she subsequently
discovered that her fees due to the university of #3333.32 were unpaid,
despite letters sent by the university.
Mr Short maintained that there had been no agreement with Ms Stephen,
and claimed that she had been dismissed without notice because she had
submitted a fraudulent expenses form to his firm.
Sheriff Davidson noted: ''His efforts to justify this in evidence were
patently cobbled together long after the event and proved nothing other
than the incompetence of the defender's own staff.''
The sheriff went on to criticise Mr Short's evidence. He recorded that
Mr Short's demeanour in the witness-box was characterised by
''evasiveness, self-justification, and garrulity'' and that he
repeatedly blamed other people.
Mr Short had also admitted inaccuracies in his evidence when matters
were drawn to his attention. His evidence was also ''inconsistent'' and,
in certain parts, ''simply beyond belief''.
In one episode highlighted by the sheriff, Mr Short told the court in
evidence that he had never been in court before in connection with
matters of unfair dismissal. Under cross-examination, he accepted that
he had been on one occasion.
But Sheriff Davidson reserved his most critical remarks for Mr Short's
claim that Ms Stephen had committed fraud.
He writes: ''For any solicitor to allege fraud, especially one who
professes to be a top class criminal lawyer, without the necessary basis
in fact to support it, is an act not only demonstrating professional
incompetence but also professional misconduct, particularly in the
circumstances here where it was directed against someone he knew was in
the course of participating in a law degree course.
''As a consequence, I propose sending a copy of this judgment to the
Law Society of Scotland for their information.''
The sheriff found Bruce Short and Co in breach of contract and
described Ms Stephen's dismissal as ''entirely without justification''.
The firm failed to issue a formal warning to Ms Stephen, failed to give
her one week's notice and was in breach of employment legislation.
However, Ms Stephen's solictor, Mr Ken Ross, had failed to furnish
evidence of her loss and his case had been ''hopelessly misconceived''.
The sheriff was unable to make an award. He comments that Ms Stephen
''has been badly treated and will have sustained loss, but I cannot make
bricks without straws''.
Ms Stephen completed her law training, and is now working for a legal
firm in Inverness.
Mr Short said last night that he was unaware of the judgment. His
mobile telephone suddenly went dead before he could pass comment.

Putting a toe in raging flood waters, scientists say the Greenhouse
Effect could be making itsel felt . . . maybe.
THE Prime Minister of France called it the Flood of the Century. The
stoical Dutch deserted their sodden homes after the deluge. Bruges was
awash and Cologne saturated. As the river washed over its banks,
Frankfurt am Main became Frankfurt unter dem Main.
And the scientists viewing the floods swirling around Europe from
their customary seat on the fence yesterday dipped metaphorical toes
into the torrent.
Yes, they conceded, there are climatic changes which are indeed
perhaps consistent with -- and might well be evidence of -- the kind of
change one could possibly associate with global warming. Maybe.
The floods which have turned tracts of France, Germany and Holland
into watery waste, the floods which cost 30 lives in California and
swept away 17 people in Georgia and left Colorado awash. The floods
which left so many homeless in Paisley at Christmas, which washed over
Wales and saturated the South West. Are these just natural events then,
natural disasters? Beyond the forces of our control?
Or are they the first signs of changes in climate caused by the global
warming the green lobby has been warning will fry us off the face of the
earth?
The theory is that excessive use of fossil fuels has led to a build-up
of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere which in time will act like a huge
greenhouse.
Professor Geofrey Bolton says it is not impossible that one of the
reasons for the stormy weather we have seen in recent years might be
that there is warming associated with the so-called Greenhouse Effect.
And a warmer climate might produce a stormier climate and flooding.
He uses lots of ''mights'', he says, because scientists are pretty
cautious: ''What was it President Truman said? Give me a one-armed
scientist who doesn't say 'on the one hand, on the other hand'.''
So the definitive answer from Professor Bolton, who heads the geology
department of Edinburgh University and regarded as Britain's leading
specialist on global warming, is: ''I don't know. But maybe.''
The best evidence, he says, comes from the Greenland Icesheet, where
scientists can plunge down through layers of frozen atmospheres trapped
over hundreds of thousands of years.
''You can plunge a hypodermic down and the air is the air around when
the atmosphere was fresh. We can tell the composition of the air when
Christ was alive.''
From this scientists have learned that the earth is always in a period
of climatic change: ''There is strong evidence that change is going on
all the time that has nothing to do with human activity.''
Even if no greenhouse gases were pumped out at all, the climate would
still change.
However, from the evidence of the ice sheet, it is possible to say
that the tendency is for the earth to be cooling. In a few thousand
years, we will be into the next glacial period.
''But it's like climbing a large mountain, Ben Nevis say. You don't
expect it to be up all the way, the foothills go up and down. We are now
in the foothills.''
The theoretical approach is that if you increase the amount of
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, like CO2s, by two times -- which has
happened since the beginning of the industrial revolution in the
mid-eighteenth century -- the earth gets warmer.
''We think it gets warmer because the solar radiation from the earth
is trapped by these gases in the atmosphere which warms the earth up.''
There is no doubt about the process, says Professor Bolton. ''But is
it happening? We can't say.''
Over the last decade, we have had three of the warmest summers since
records began in the middle of the seventeenth century. These extremes
tend to imply the earth is getting warmer, explains the professor.
One of the outcomes is that if the atmosphere gets warmer it will get
stormier. If it's warmer, the atmosphere holds more water. That means
more rain.
So when, precisely, will science be able to tell us what is happening
to the climate? ''What we are saying is that we will tell you whether it
is the Greenhouse Effect when it has well and truly happened.''
Dr Gordon Dickinson of Glasgow University thinks the jury is still
out.
He will concede that we are in a period where there is a high degree
of climatic variability: ''Certainly in the West of Scotland there is
good evidence, statistically sound evidence, that is has got
significantly wetter over the last 25 years.''
You may already have noticed. There is around 10% more rain about in
Scotland now. Summers are slighty drier. This could be a naturally
occurring change in climate.
But, Dr Dickinson explains, what we are seeing now is that the range
of variation is towards the end of the spectrum that can be predicted
statistically. Which seems to mean that the evidence for global warming
is there but the scientists can't prove it.
''What has happened in Northern and Western Europe, particularly over
the last five years when we have had a lot of severe flooding, is
associated with global warming. We cannot prove it, but I am beginning
to be persuaded that this is the likely case.''
Dr Bob Harwood is a reader in meteorology at Edinburgh University. He
points out that many people believe the floods we see now are similar
those of 50 years ago.
''It's extremely difficult to demonstrate what is causing the
floods,'' he says. ''Most professional meteorologists are cautious about
linking this to global warming.
''However we are getting an unusual frequency of south-west winds,
which are warmer. If we have global warming you would expect it to be
slightly warmer and wetter than before.
''If the question is, is there global warming, the answer is we don't
know.''
Neither does Richard Tabony, a meteorologist at the Met Office in
Edinburgh -- but he is prepared to have a go. ''I think it could be said
that the current weather in Eureope is perhaps consistent with what
might be expected under global warming,'' he says.
If there were global warming, he says, we would expect warmer and
wetter weather across the whole of Europe in winter. Which is what we
have had.
There have been bursts of very warm and very humid air charging across
the Atlantic, he says -- ''and whenever these fronts become slow moving,
places get clobbered''.
A change in atmospheric circulations has meant an increase in the
frequency of south-westerly winds, and decreased frequency of
north-easterly ones. This means warmer, wetter weather which is, says Mr
Tabony in a rare scientific outburst of clarity, an expected outcome of
global warming.
If we go on shovelling carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, a
climatologist at the Met Office's Hadley Centre has predicted, the world
temperature will rise by about 0.2 degrees centrigade a decade. That is
double the maximum we have seen so far.
Given that scientists are not prepared to speculate about the future
of the climate and the effects we might expect from global warning,
should we? Or should people in glasshouses who drive cars and use
aerosols refrain from flinging stones at science?

<RECORDNO>980074718</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
Los Angeles, Tuesday
A HYSTERICAL, bruised Nicole Brown Simpson told a police officer on
New Year's Day 1989 that O J Simpson slapped and kicked her and pulled
her hair.
''She said, 'He's going to kill me','' John Edwards testified at
Simpson's murder trial. ''I said, 'Who's going to kill you?' She said,
'O J'.''
''I was a little surprised,'' said Edwards. ''I said, 'O J who? You
mean the football player?' She said, 'Yes, O J Simpson, the football
player.'''
Simpson, 47, the football player turned actor and sports commentator,
has denied murdering his ex-wife and her waiter friend, Ronald Goldman.
Simpson eventually pleaded no contest to spouse battery in the
incident on New Year's Day, 1989.
Edwards testified that he went to the Simpson home that morning and
found Ms Simpson in a state of hysteria, with ''a hand imprint on her
throat'', a cut lip, and bruises on her face. Photos of her bruised face
were shown.
He quoted Simpson as saying: '' 'I don't want that woman in my bed any
more. I got two other women, I don't want that woman in my bed any
more'.''
Sharyn Gilbert, the police emergency line operator, who took the call
that morning, testified that she ''heard a female screaming'' and
someone being hit.
Earlier, prosecutor Marcia Clark told jurors that a key defence
witness who claimed to have seen four men fleeing from the area of the
killings was ''a known liar and a Simpson case groupie''.
Clark said the defence witness, Mary Anne Gerchas, had told a friend
she was not even near Ms Simpson's home the night of the murders.
In her rebuttal statement, Clark called Gerchas ''one of those people
who comes out of the woodwork'' in high-profile cases.
She also told jurors they would see Simpson in a video made two weeks
before the murders showing him in good physical condition, doing
push-ups and other exercises. The defence had argued that his arthritis
would have made it impossible for him to kill two people.
Yesterday the defence completed its opening statement and revealed
Simpson's alibi: night golf.
Lawyer Johnnie Cochran said Simpson was hitting golf balls into his
children's sandbox shortly after 10pm on June 12 -- the day that, he
told jurors earlier, Simpson had suffered an arthritis flare-up so
severe he struggled to shuffle cards.

THE Government and the Bank of England should make up the shortfall in
compensation offered to the creditors of the crashed Bank of Credit and
Commerce International, according to the Western Isles Council and other
creditors.
The council, which attracted international ridicule when it lost more
than #23m in BCCI three-and-a-half years ago, last night welcomed the
news that a Luxembourg court had finally approved a #1200m compensation
package.
The offer has been made by the bank's main shareholder, the ruling
family of Abu Dhabi. According to liquidators Touche Ross last night
there was now a target of about 20p in the pound for creditors who lost
more than #75,000, with the first dividend to be paid in June or July,
if there were no other delays.
Earlier it had been hoped that compensation might have been in the
order of 30p to 40p in the pound but that would not be possible in the
first dividend.
Now the Western Isles Council is anxious that the court decision is
not appealed and that the liquidators can move quickly towards a
part-payment. Councillors still believe the Government and the Bank of
England have a responsibility to make up the balance since the bank
appeared on their approved list.
Mr Angus Graham, the council's vice-convener, said last night: ''While
we welcome this decision it doesn't mean a cash bonanza for the council.
Any funds recovered will have to be used to repay the further borrowing
consent given by the Scottish Office in 1991. However, it would mean a
reduction in the loan charges payable by the council and we await
developments with interest.''
Mrs Maureen Devine-Palit, of the BCCI Victims Distress Group, was also
looking for more: ''There should be more money because somebody has to
make up our losses. That is why we shall be relying on legal actions
against the Bank of England. We did not rob banks or stab people in the
back. All we did was put our money in a High Street bank approved by the
Bank of England and lost it all.''
The Western Isles Labour MP, Mr Calum Macdonald, said it was vital
that the Government did not now begin to claw back the increase in the
Special Islands Allowance. ''The Government have maintained that we got
that on our own merits and so we will be holding them to that. It is
worth up to #4m and really has cushioned the effects of BCCI. We can't
afford to lose that now.''

A SCHOOLBOY has been killed in a joy-riding incident involving a car
believed to have been driven by a 14-year-old boy.
David Gray, 15, was a passenger in the rear of a Vauxhall Nova which
crossed Gilmerton Dykes Street, Edinburgh, and crashed into a Rover
driven by Mrs Mary Kay, of The Spinney, Edinburgh.
He lived in Ferniehill Drive, Edinburgh, a short distance from the
scene of the crash, with two brothers.
Mrs Kay was taken to Edinburgh Royal Infirmary for treatment along
with a 17-year-old youth who also had been travelling in the rear of the
Nova.
Two others in the Vauxhall, which it is understood disappeared earlier
in East Lothian, were said by police to have made off after the accident
which happened about 9.30pm on Monday.
Police said that the driver and a 15-year-old girl passenger, who was
in the front seat, had now been traced.
Mrs Kay was slightly injured in the accident and was detained in
hospital. The injured 17-year-old was allowed home after treatment.
Police are appealing to anyone who may have seen the accident.
A spokesman for Lothian and Borders Police said yesterday that the
male driver of the car would be charged with several serious offences
and that a report involving three teenagers was currently being prepared
for the procurator-fiscal.

'Don't mess with me' -- the message came across loud and clear as the
Princess of Wales cast off her Shy Di image in New York. Sara Villiers
explains why the new look may be no womanly whim but a calculated
change.
HAS the Glamour Blonde turned into a Power Poser? The Princess of
Wales's latest transformation has certainly finally put the lid on her
original Shy Di look. When she turned up at the Council of Fashion
Designers' award ceremony in New York on Monday night her new wet-look
hairstyle instantly prompted a tidal wave of public comment.
Critics sneered that she looked as if she had just stepped out of the
shower, but veteran royal watchers realised the new image was not down
to womanly whim. It was a calculated change.
The aesthetic appeal of the hairdo is debatable but it certainly made
the intended impression. The guests gaped at the princess's new
incarnation: a big-shouldered amazon striding along with the swept-back
mane revealing a strong, sassy woman. Far from peeking coyly behind a
heavy fringe, she tilted her chin upwards and gazed confidently out at
the paparazzi.
So, Di has done it again. Prince Charles has to go to the unholy
lengths of publicly admitting marital infidelity to fire himself into
the spotlight -- and inadvertently shoot himself in the foot -- but his
estranged spouse merely has to tuck her hair behind her ears to ensure
world-wide coverage. In a changing world of little certainty one thing
is guaranteed: Diana's hairline always hits the headlines.
While the tabloids scream ''Hairdo from hell'' professional reaction
is mixed. Top Scots hairdresser Taylor Ferguson fears the new style
isn't flattering because it exaggerates the prominence of the royal
hooter, but he commends Diana's desire for change. ''She has simply
gelled her hair back, which is something women do when they can't do
anything with their hair, but it's encouraging to see a high-profile
person try something different,'' he says. ''It's certainly more
glamorous and it could be nice, but it's not quite right just now.''
Harriet Jagger, beauty editor of Tatler magazine agrees: ''I think she
looked better before but I think it's great that she took such a big
chance. Knowing the attention she would get I reckon it was a pretty
brave thing to do.''
Scottish hairdresser Rita Rusk is not convinced: ''The change is too
dramatic. She should have altered gradually rather than going zap, from
a soft look to a style which is too severe for her.''
The severity of the hairstyle was probably intentional; this was a
different woman from the Diana of that very afternoon. When the princess
dangled a sick child on her lap at a hospital in Harlem her crowning
glory was a mumsy mop of curls. By the evening her new slick style
clearly assserted ''don't mess with me''.
The gelled locks have prompted comparisons with that other
iconoclastic female, Madonna, and Diana obviously wants to be associated
with a similar aggressive style. Ironically, the masculine hairdo could
also be compared with Prince Charles's, leading to musings of how
obsessively Diana fussed over her side parting. Perhaps her sculpted
waves are even a symbolic reference to another famous femme, the Statue
of Liberty, further fuelling the speculation that Diana sees her future
Stateside?
The will-she-won't-she debate over the possibility of Diana moving to
the US is a source of endless fascination to royalty-obsessed Americans.
This week's visit was her fifth trip to the States in the past 12
months. Having made a big impression on Washington's swanky socialite
scene last year, Diana has shown an increasing penchant for New York.
Buckingham Palace intervened after her last trip there in October to
dismiss rumours that she intended to buy a $3.5m apartment in the city
as ''absolute nonsense''. None the less, New York magazine recently
devoted its cover to speculation on Diana taking up local residence,
compiling suggestions as to where she would live, shop and, crucially,
where she would have her hair done.
The magazine tipped the charming Frederic Fekkai and Brit Geoffrey
Frith at John Freida as contenders for tenders of the royal coiffeur but
when it came to making her big statement on Monday night Diana turned to
Scots super-crimper Sam McKnight, a freelance stylist, who has been
overseeing her hair for the past two years.
McKnight will now have to undergo the hell of hearing his work derided
worldwide. The acclaim of being Di's hairdresser brings perks but also
pressure. Last month Daniel Galvin, a renowned workaholic who often
styles her hair in London, checked into a drink-and-drugs rehab clinic.
The princess said she was ''very distressed and concerned''.
So she should be. A crafty media manipulator, Diana recognises the
importance of her crimpers. Despite her work with Aids patients, the
homeless, and the countless photo opportunities with worthy causes, the
princess has always exploited the superficial impact created each time
she waves her image wand. She knows a few shorn locks inspire more copy
than any number of weighty speeches.
In 1984 she caused an outcry when a severe swept-forward style
detracted attention from the Queen during the state opening of
Parliament. She paid heed to the criticism of that longer style and
after only a couple of public appearances it was cut and shortened into
a curlier, much copied version.
This week's hairstyle has met with similar criticism but it is
doubtful that the Di of '95 will pay as much heed to the cavils. The
beefed-up, gym-addicted princess who dares to flaunt some gained pounds
and a slight paunch has obviously learned some body-confidence since her
bulimia-afflicted days.
However, the hairstyle is probably a temporary measure, with Diana
revelling in the fuss it caused. ''I am convinced it was a one-off
event,'' asserts Nigel Evans, editor of Majesty magazine. ''The ceremony
was a big fashion event, attended by people like Claudia Schiffer, and
she had to meet expectations to look striking. It's significant that she
hasn't actually changed her hair. She's just restyled it. It's extremely
contemporary and I doubt if she would show up to any official
engagements in Britian looking like that.''
There will be no immediate chance to find out. Buckingham Palace says
there is nothing on the princess's official agenda for now. But who
knows? Perhaps this new playful Diana will go one stage further the next
time.
As far back as 1990 she revealed radical inclinations. Visiting
Donaldson's School for the Deaf in Bathgate, the princess stepped back
from seven-year-old David Allison's portrait of her with blue hair and
mused: ''It might look better than I have it now.''

THE jury in the Safeway poisoning case will retire to consider a
verdict today.
In closing speeches yesterday the Crown outlined a chain of
circumstantial evidence which it said pointed ''compellingly'' to the
guilt of university lecturer Paul Agutter.
The defence asked the jury to acquit Dr Agutter and reject the notion
that he was a ''cunning, devious, and evil'' poisoner who tried to
murder his wife.
Dr Agutter, a biochemistry lecturer at Napier University, Edinburgh,
denies attempting to murder his wife Alex, 39, in their home at
Athelstaneford, East Lothian, on August 28 last year, by lacing her gin
and tonic with atropine.
He also denies endangering the lives of the public by placing bottles
contaminated with atropine on the shelves of Safeway, at Hunters' Tryst,
Swanston, Edinburgh, on August 24. A number of people drank the tonic
and became ill.
Mr Andrew Lamb, Advocate-depute, told the jury at the High Court in
Edinburgh that the Crown did not have to prove a motive. However, they
were entitled to look at the background of Dr Agutter's suicidal
tendencies when he telephoned his doctor urgently a week before poisoned
tonic water appeared in Safeway.
According to his GP, Dr Agutter had spoken of financial problems over
what he saw as an inequitable financial settlement with his wife and of
pressure to marry his girlfriend, Carole Bonsall.
A student working in Safeway had spoken of Dr Agutter acting
suspiciously at the tonic water shelves. Mr Lamb added that the jury
could draw the inference that this was connected with the accused
placing adulterated bottles on the shelves.
When his wife took ill,it was significant that Dr Agutter had not
treated the matter with urgency.
Mr Lamb emphasised the much higher concentration of atropine in Mrs
Agutter's gin and tonic -- 292mg per litre -- and the Safeway tonic
bottle's 103mg.
They might draw the conclusion, he added, that in order to conceal his
intentions Paul Agutter placed tonic contaminated with atropine on the
shelves at Hunters' Tryst so that random members of the public could buy
them and suffer poisoning in far lesser quantity than his wife.
Mr Neil Murray QC, defending Dr Agutter, said poisoning cases had a
sort of Victorian aura about them, the sort you read about in pulp
fiction. It was an insidious and nasty type of crime.
If Dr Agutter was the conniving, cunning, devious, and evil man
portrayed by the Crown, would he have phoned the doctor after his wife
fell ill -- the same doctor he had called a few days earlier to discuss
his marital problems?
It was true that Dr Agutter had a girlfriend but his wife knew about
that and there was no problem. Dr Agutter and his wife seemed to have an
accommodating nature towards each other's sexual peccadilloes. That did
not fit into the Victorian poisoning scenario.
''He is going to kill his wife so he can carry on as he had done?''
That did not make sense, suggested Mr Murray.
Under hours of questioning by police the accused had not come within
an ace of saying ''It was me''. Yet the Crown would have the jury
believe that he had found two soulmates in turnkeys at Edinburgh Sheriff
Court and confessed his guilt to them.
Mr Murray added: ''This scheming, devious, intelligent man sets it all
at nought and says to them 'I am guilty and have no remorse.' Ladies and
gentlemen of the jury, you are here to use common sense.''
No explanation had been offered by the Crown as to how the Safeway
bottles had been poisoned. Removing bottles from the store,
contaminating them, and returning them to the shelves was ''tricky''
given supermarket security.
The alternative was that the bottles had been poisoned in the store.
''That is really easy. Let's go up this aisle and hide behind the
cucumbers while I unscrew the cap and put the poison in. Let's take
another bottle and hide behind the frozen chicken nuggets and do it.''
Mr Murray also stressed the fact that the piece of evidence on which

HUNTSVILLE: Texas executed a pair of convicted killers by lethal
injection yesterday, the first double execution in the state since 1950.
Clifton Russell, 33, and Willie Williams, 38, died within an hour of one
another. Texas joins Arkansas as the only state to conduct a multiple
execution since the US Supreme Court restored the death penalty in 1976,
and leads the US in executions since then.

HOPES that Frances colliery might be redeveloped into a ''super'' pit,
employing 1000 colliers, were ended yesterday by a decision by British
Coal to cease its costly care and maintenance programme at the Fife
mine.
Since it was damaged by fire during the 1984-5 pit strike, British
Coal has spent approximately #1.9m a year to keep the two shafts
''mothballed'' and the pit free from water damage.
The decision to end care and maintenance, albeit with continued water
pumping and monitoring for the time being, follows the lack of an
acceptable offer for Frances, which would require an estimated #200m to
reopen.
The only interest shown was from Mining (Scotland), which wanted a
year's grace to allow time for a #50,000 feasibility study of Frances's
prospects. This was not acceptable to the Government, which then asked
British Coal how it could divest itself of the Fife coalfield.
All may not be lost, however, because British Coal maintains that much
of the 34 million tonnes of coal reserves could be exploited through a
combination of open casting and subsequent drift mining.
It remains to be seen whether Mining (Scotland), which took over
British Coal's other Scottish interests, including nine open cast sites,
at the turn of the year for about #40m, will renew its interest in
Frances.
The Scottish NUM has long seen Frances as representing a future for
Scottish deep mines, now down to just Longannet, which is about to have
its life extended to 2020.
A deeply disappointed president, Mr George Bolton, last night accused
British Coal of ''wilful sabotage of a potentially large coalfield'' and
warned of massive pollution of large areas of Fife if the pumps were
turned off, although it might not become apparent for some years.
He doubted that much of the reserves could be accessed by alternatives
to deep mining, as they were located under the sea. He recalled that it
was not so many years ago that British Coal was itself considering
developing Frances as a ''super pit'', capable of producing cheap low
sulphur coal.
The STUC general secretary, Mr Campbell Christie, who is also a
director of Mining (Scotland), called for urgent discussions with
British Coal in a bid to ensure that, in the desperation to pull out,
valuable coal reserves were not lost.
It was most important that the reserves were not flooded, he said,
adding that British Coal could not just stop pumping and walk away,
because flooding would destroy the coal reserves and cause pollution.
Mr Robert King, chairman of the Forth River Purification Board, said
he expected to reach a satisfactory long-term solution with British Coal
and would not ''under any circumstances'' permit pollution from the
mines.

THREE malt distilleries are to be closed until further notice by their
new owners, Whyte &amp; Mackay, because of surplus whisky production.
The Bruichladdich distillery on Islay, Tamnavulin-Glenlivet on
Speyside, and Tullibardine near Dunblane -- famous for their single malt
brands and formerly run by the Invergordon group -- will cease
production shortly, with the loss of about 25 jobs.
Whyte &amp; Mackay, a subsidiary of American Brands which bought
Edinburgh-based Invergordon, one of the few whisky independents, in a
#350m takeover two years ago, said the move was regrettable but strictly
temporary.
Mr Charles Shaw, the group's marketing director, said: ''We have been
forced to mothball the distilleries because of the excess single malt
production in the industry, but we hope to reopen them sometime in the
future.
''It's impossible to give a date, but all three will be looked after
until then on a care-and-maintenance basis by a handful of workers.''
The industry has been plagued by surplus production in recent years
and it is no surprise that Whyte &amp; Mackay, which runs three of its own
malt distilleries, has decided to ''sacrifice'' recently acquired
operations.
The Scotch Whisky Association spokesman, Mr Campbell Evans, said a 26p
per bottle tax rise announced in the Budget must have played a part in
the closures.
* Perth-based Matthew Gloag and Son, makers of the Famous Grouse, is
moving to a greenfield site at the entrance to the city, near the
Friarton Bridge.
Mr John Goodwin, chairman of Highland Distilleries, owners of Gloag's,
cut the first turf yesterday at the 17-acre site on the banks of the
River Tay.
The move will see 80 administrative staff shift from the present
building in Perth's city centre. The company's bottling plant will
remain on its present location in Perth.

THE #663,000-a-year chairman of BT infuriated junior doctors by saying
it might be ''relaxing'' to do their job. He also roused the ire of the
Labour party and the unions.
Sir Iain Vallance was justifying his salary to the Commons employment
select committee investigating executive pay in the wake of public
outcry over ''excessive'' boardroom wages.
Sir Iain told MPs his basic annual pay of #465,000 was topped up by
#185,000 bonus and benefits worth #13,000.
He is also paid #50,000 by the Royal Bank of Scotland for his role on
a committee which decides pay rises for its senior executives.
Sir Iain said he worked 70 hours a week on BT business. and
one-and-a-half days a month for the bank. ''I would quite like a job as
a junior doctor, it might be relaxing,'' he told the all-party
committee.
But last night he said: ''I regret making the point in rather a flip
way, but the point is very well made.''
Asked about junior doctors and their hours he replied: ''I have
sympathy with them for working such long, hard hours.''
But a junior doctors' leader last night said he had never met an
executive who had to make life-or-death decisions.
Dr Edwin Boorman, British Medical Association spokesman for junior
doctors, said they were supposed to work no more than 72 hours a week,
but a recent survey showed more than half were working even more.
The basic pay for the first 40 hours of a junior doctor's contract
starts in some parts of the country at #12,500, and the best-paid junior
doctor earns no more than #36,000 for more than 70 hours a week.
Told about Sir Iain's comments, Dr Boorman said: ''If he finds it
relaxing to work flat out with just one or two hours' sleep over a
weekend, constantly being aware of patients' health and having to break
bad news to people, he has obviously missed his vocation.''
Sir Iain, 51, told the committee his pay was a ''just and fair
reward'' for his job and he rejected the idea that workers should have a
say in his salary.
The level of his pay was decided by a remuneration committee made up
entirely of non-executive directors.
Committee chairman Greville Janner, Labour MP for Leicester West, told
Sir Iain there was a ''very deep'' public concern about what was
happening to executives' pay in privatised industries, and asked the BT
chairman what should be done to address this anxiety.
Sir Iain, a member of the CBI committee set up to investigate
executive pay, said evidence would be heard from company
representatives, shareholders and others, including unions.
But he was challenged by Mr Janner, who said it will be seen as an
''employers' committee'' because it was made up of top business leaders.
BT rallied to its chairman's defence over his junior doctors remark.
The company said Sir Iain was usually at his desk in London by 7.30 am
and normally left the office 12 hours later.
''He is genuinely known as a hard-working chairman who sets a very
good example,'' a spokesman added.
But Labour reacted furiously to the comments.
Mr Andrew Smith, Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, said: ''This
crass remark shows how badly out of touch privatised utilities'
boardrooms are, and how out of touch the Government is for failing to
take the action Labour has called for to empower the regulators of
privatised industries to sort things out.''
Tessa Jowell, a former Labour member of the Commons health committee,
said: ''I suggest he (Sir Iain) actually works a week of shifts with a
junior doctor before he makes statements about the comparative
relaxation of his and their jobs.
''I am sure he would find the experience quite humbling,'' the Dulwich
MP added.
The Communication Workers Union, which represents BT workers, said Sir
Iain earned 30 times as much as a junior doctor.
The going rate
* For the 70-hour week he works Sir Iain Valance, right, receives
#663,000 in salary, bonus and benefits.
* An industrial tribunal in Glasgow was told earlier this month that
junior doctors were paid #13,590 for their basic 40-hour week. They can
often expect to work 72 hours weekly in surgery, with overtime paid at
the rate of 50% of their basic hourly rate.

THE Government was called on to save the Motorail service to Scotland
in the Lords yesterday by one of its own back-benchers. Lord Renton,
former Tory MP, said the service kept cars off the roads on long
journeys. But Transport Minister Viscount Goschen said it was too
expensive. ''The service has provided a valuable facility but it's
extremely expensive to operate and in fact is used to carry very few
vehicles.'' Lord Renton said that privatisation had been presented by
the Government and supported by Tory peers ''on the assumption that this
valuable service will be retained.'' Peers with estates in Scotland have
complained that the loss of the service and certain sleeper services
will make it difficult for them to get home.

SCOTRAIL last night dismissed suggestions that 60 rail jobs were under
threat in Fort William as a result of plans to shift the focus of the
West Highland Line operation to Mallaig.
A local councillor, who until recently was a train driver, is adamant
the company has its figures wrong, while Labour's industry spokesman, Mr
Brian Wilson, said the news put Fort William in the frontline of railway
madness.
A ScotRail spokesman insisted the company had only 40 employees in
Fort William. ''We have 20 drivers, 12 train crew, and eight conductors.
These are the figures I got from our personnel department. Nine of these
jobs will be shifted to Mallaig where our workforce will almost double
from nine to 17 or 18.
''Sixteen will remain in Fort William, and in all likelihood 15 jobs
will disappear. This will be done only after consultation, through
voluntary redundancy, transfers, early retirement, etc. But I would
stress this has all to be negotiated.''
He conceded that with the impending loss of the sleeper/Motorail
service to Fort William the position was going to be more difficult.
''We will be trying to operate at a time of increased costs and
budgetary restrictions, but we see this as a positive move, as a
commitment to the future.''
He didn't imagine that anybody would be forced to move the 40 miles to
Mallaig from Fort William. Staff would be offered the chance to go.
Travelling might also be a possibility.
Councillor Euan Harper, who represents the Nevis ward on Highland
Regional Council, was a train driver at Fort William until December. He
said yesterday he had been tipped off by a ''very reliable inside
source'' of impending cutbacks at Fort William which would leave only a
skeleton staff.
According to Mr Harper, 22 drivers, 15 train crew and eight conductors
would go. In addition, five shunters, five ScotRail supervisors and five
cleaners could also be under threat.
''The 150-mile stretch of the West Highland Line is set to be worked
by 27 employees from its Glasgow end and eight from the Mallaig
terminus. And before very long there may well only be Sprinter trains
running on the line, to keep the Government's hollow promise that it
will remain open, providing a service.''
Mr Harper said the community had to fight to save the jobs and
Lochaber's railway system.
Mr Wilson warned that the threat hanging over Fort William today could
come to other communities in the future:
''If the Government's franchise director can effectively abolish
Motorail and wipe out sleeper services, without consulting anyone, then
communities throughout Britain will understand that the same thing could
happen to the railways in the months ahead.''
He said nothing should happen without the full consultation demanded
by Major-General Lennox Napier, chairman of the Central Rail Users
Consultative Committee.
Mr Charles Kennedy, Scottish Liberal Democrat MP for Ross, Cromarty
and Skye, said last night: ''This will come as a severe blow to all
those campaigning for the Fort William connection in particular and the
Highland rail services in general.
''It is a further indication of the chronic funding squeeze on
ScotRail and it shows how impossible it will be to maintain effective
rail services as privatisation approaches.''

<HEADLINE>Major moves to refute leaked report of new UK-Irish framework document.    Britain 'in plan for all-Ireland authority'</HEADLINE>

THE four-month ceasefire in Northern Ireland was in deep jeopardy
early today when the Prime Minister summoned an emergency meeting of 60
Ministers and back benchers in his room at the Commons.
Today, Mr Major may go on television to make a special statement to
refute reports that he has done a deal with Dublin to promote
all-Ireland authorities.
The situation was so serious late last night that Mr Major called in
his back benchers and Ministers to deny a leaked document to The Times
which alleges that a deal has been done to create a joint cross-border
authority with executive powers, including the right to deal with the
European Union in Brussels.
The leaked document goes on to declare: ''The birthright of everyone
born in either jurisdiction to be part of as right of the Irish
nation.''
It also refers to a ''harmonisation of agricultural, trade, education
and health policies.'' Further powers and functions will be extended.
The leaked draft document from Dublin astonished the Government last
night. Mr Major called in 60 of his Tory colleagues including key
Ministers to refute it. His Cabinet colleague Viscount Cranborne,
Government leader in the House of Lords, declared at the meeting: ''This
is rubbish. It will not stand.''
Viscount Cranborne resigned from Government when he was in the House
of Commons when Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher signed the UK-Irish
deal allowing Dublin a say in Northern Ireland affairs.
The concern in Government that the whole peace process and the
four-month old ceasefire could be placed in jeopardy by The Times report
forced the Prime Minister into dramatic reaction.
Today Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew is scheduled to
make an emergency statement in the House of Commons. If this is judged
not to be sufficient to reassure all those involved in the delicate
peace process, the Prime Minister is preparing to go on television
tonight.
Decisions about how the Government should handle this today will
depend on an early morning meeting between Mr Major and the Ulster
Unionist leader, Mr James Molyneaux. The two men were meeting in the
Prime Minister's room in the Commons at 1am today. Mr Major was trying
to reassure Mr Molyneaux that the leak of a proposed joint framework
document is propaganda emanating from Dublin.
According to this leaked draft there would be an Irish body which
brings together representatives of the Irish Government with those of a
planned devolved Ulster administrative assembly. New cross-border
institutions will bring together senior politicians and civil servants
from North and South.
Executive powers would be sweeping. In the first instance they would
take over from ''sectors involving a natural and physical all-Ireland
framework. European Commission programmes and initiatives'' would also
be consolidated in an all-Ireland body.
Crucially, according to the report, the extent of the body's eventual
responsibilities is left completely open-ended. It quoted the draft as
stating: ''The British Government has no limits to impose on the nature
and extent of functions in the transferred field.''
The Times said the document envisaged a constitutional trade-off
between London and Dublin, with Britain amending or replacing the 1920
Act of Partition which asserts the sovereignty of Parliament in the
province.
In return, the Irish Government would introduce proposals to change
articles 2 and 3 of the its constitution which embody its territorial
claim to Northern Ireland. The Times said the document brought the
prospect of a united Ireland closer than it had been at any time since
partition in 1920.
This would undermine Mr Major's pledge to Ulster that any
constitutional agreements drawn up by the Unionists and Sinn Fein will
be put to a Northern Ireland referendum.
Downing Street said the joint framework document was not yet complete
and important issues remained to be agreed. ''There is no question of
the British Government agreeing to joint authority by London and
Dublin,'' the statement stressed.
Downing Street said any North-South mechanisms would be accountable to
a Northern Ireland assembly. ''Even when agreement is reached between
the British and Irish Governments, this is only a consultation document
for further consideration,'' the statement said.
''After consideration by Ulster politicians and by the people of
Northern Ireland, it will have to be further considered in talks between
the constitutional parties.''
The explosive position had to be addressed immediately by the Prime
Minister early today.
One Tory MP present at the meeting in Mr Major's room said afterwards:
''This is very serious and it could undermine the whole peace process
and the ceasefire. Sir Patrick will make a statement in the Commons. The
Prime Minister is talking to Mr Molyneaux now. If there is any further
doubt about it the Prime Minister is considering making a special
statement on television to the nation tomorrow.''
Viscount Cranborne last night is satisfied that Mr Major will be able
to convince Mr Molyneaux that the leaked report is unfounded. Viscount
Cranborne, the most vital supporter of the Unionist cause in the
Cabinet, is not on the point of resignation.
In Dublin, there was no immediate formal comment on the report. But
sources close to the three-party coalition administration of Prime
Minister John Bruton made clear their doubts that the source of any leak
had been in the Irish capital.
Mr Molyneaux, before his meeting with Mr Major, said: ''This plan does
not appear to have much ministerial input or to have come before
Cabinet, but clearly the time has come for the Government to choose
between our practical proposals and those unreal and devious schemes
which have been hawked around since Christmas and to which we have made
clear our strong objections.''
Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the Democratic Unionist Party,
said Ulster was ''in peril'' and called on all Unionists to form
together in a United Unionist Forum ''to determine the means by which we
resist Dublin rule''.
He said the joint North-South body with executive powers which was
planned would have ''an inbuilt republican majority''.
Half its members would be drawn from the Irish Republic and the other
half would be drawn from Northern Ireland on a basis of proportional
representation between nationalist and unionist. ''So we have to be
prepared to have an inbuilt republican majority.''
And he said plans for Ireland as a whole to be dealt with by Europe as
a single entity was the ''penultimate step to a united Ireland''.

THE Scottish Liberal Democrats have protested at the alleged
''gagging'' of ScotRail director Mr Chris Green in the wake of his bleak
assessment of the network's fate on privatisation in an article in The
Herald.
Mr Green has been ordered to ''stick to the company line'' by the
British Railways Board since his comments about the standards of
services if subsidies were not increased.
Ross, Cromarty, and Skye MP Charles Kennedy said it was also the
desperate action of a Government on the run over a disastrous
privatisation which was wreaking havoc on the railways. He has written
to Transport Secretary Brian Mawhinney about the ''unjustifiable
infringement of his freedom of speech''.

THE Very Rev Dr Robert Craig, Moderator of the General Assembly of the
Church of Scotland, 1986-87, was the principal who guided the University
of Zimbabwe (previously of Rhodesia) through the country's transition to
legal independence.
He was also Minister of the Scots Church in Jerusalem, but was never a
parish minister in Scotland.
Born in 1917 and brought up in Markinch, he was educated at Fife
schools and St Andrews University, where he graduated in Arts.
He was ordained in 1942 to be an Army chaplain after his Divinity
degree and serving briefly as assistant at St John's Kirk, Perth.
At the Normandy landings he was chaplain to the 5th South
Staffordshires and was mentioned in despatches. Transferred to the 15th
(Scottish) Division, he later served with the Royal Scots Fusiliers
before going to the Middle East with the 1st King's Own Scottish
Borderers.
He left to study at New York's Union Theological Seminary and, after a
spell as deputy leader of the Iona Community under George MacLeod, took
a PhD at St Andrews.
In 1950, he went to South Africa as Professor of Divinity at the
University of Natal in Pietermaritzburg, moving to a chair in religion
at Smith College, Massachusetts, in 1958.
He was unhappy with the impact of apartheid on South African
universities, but felt the pull of Africa.
''It seems to call you back,'' he said, and returned in 1963 as
Professor of Theology in the multi-racial University College of Rhodesia
and Nyasaland at Salisbury.
He became vice-principal, acted twice as principal, and did so well in
1969 he became obvious choice as permanent principal and
vice-chancellor, 1971-80.
He then served for four years as minister of St Andrew's, Jerusalem.
He retired to Falkland in Fife.
In 1981, he was appointed CBE for his work in Zimbabwe.
He was married in 1950 in St Columba's, Pont Street, to Olga Strzelec.
They had a daughter and son.

SCOTLAND's most senior civil servant in charge of industrial and roads
policy, controlling an annual budget of some #1200m, is unlikely to be
replaced when he retires from the Civil Service in September.
As part of a senior management review of the entire Scottish Office,
the Industry Department -- which oversees the work of the Scottish
Enterprise network and is responsible for regional aid to industry,
skills training, and the roads programme -- could be merged with another
department.
The Scottish Office review is part of the overall effort to hold the
costs of running government to the same cash level in 1997/98 as was
achieved in 1993/94. That means, in effect, a real cut in running costs
of around 10%.
The most likely merger candidates for the Scottish Office Industry
Department appear to be the Agriculture and Fisheries Department or
Environment, which controls local government and housing policy.
The Scottish Office concedes that the departure of Mr Peter Mackay,
55, this summer, ''provides valuable flexibility'' in dealing with a
review which is expected to require reductions in the numbers of the
most senior Scottish Office staff, grades one to five, currently
totalling 200 posts.
But a spokesman described as ''highly speculative'' any inference that
Mr Mackay's department would be merged with either Environment or
Agriculture and Fisheries. Nevertheless, unofficial sources indicate
that that is likely to be the outcome.
The steering committee overseeing the senior management review only
met for the first time last Friday. It consists of the permanent
secretary, Sir Russell Hillhouse; the secretary of the Scottish Office
Education Department, Mr Gerry Wilson; an under-secretary at the
Treasury, Miss Gill Noble; and one outsider, Mr Garth Heron, the
personnel director (operations) at United Distillers.
A consultative process is under way which is likely to be completed in
March. Between April and September the review will focus on the best new
structure both to achieve the necessary cost savings and provide the
necessary service to Ministers.
At the moment the biggest part of the industry portfolio is coupled
with the local government aspects of Environment, in the hands of Mr
Allan Stewart, MP. The rest of industry -- roads, tourism, and other
aspects -- are the responsibility of Lord James Douglas-Hamilton.
Earlier this month the Scottish Office coupled the news of Mr Mackay's
early departure with the announcement that Mr Muir Russell, 46, had been
promoted to the post of secretary of the Agriculture and Fisheries
Department, succeeding Mr Kenneth MacKenzie, now on loan to the Cabinet
Office as head of the Economic and Domestic Secretariat.
After 32 years in the Civil Service, Mr Mackay's decision to leave
five years before the normal retirement age was a personal one, dictated
by a desire to seek a fresh professional challenge.
The January 11 announcement said: ''Mr Mackay's successor will be
announced later in the year.'' But the senior management review process
is likely to render that succession redundant.
* Mr Muir Russell, who moves from head of housing within the
Environment Department, to take over Agriculture and Fisheries, is
expected to resign shortly from the board of Stagecoach Holdings, the
Perth-based private bus operator.
His appointment, in a non-executive capacity, to the Stagecoach board,
under a scheme to give civil servants experience of outside industry,
was condemned by Opposition MPs at the time.

THE Government will be powerless to stop cuts in the existing levels
of passenger services provided by British Rail, Labour claimed yesterday
following the announcement of a potential 20% cut in services under
privatisation.
Under figures published yesterday for four of the rail franchises up
for sale -- all in the south of England -- private operators will be
able to reduce services on certain routes despite Government assurances
given last month that privatisation will be based on the existing BR
timetable.
However, franchising director Roger Salmon indicated that in Scotland
services on rural routes could remain broadly the same. ''For heavily
subsidised routes I will, in most cases, be requiring the full service
level,'' he said.
The Passenger Service Requirements (PSRs) were drawn up by Mr Salmon
who is co-ordinating privatisation. They set a minimum level of service
-- numbers of trains, first and last of the day, weekend service --
which franchise operators will have to agree to provide.
The figures provoked heated exchanges during Prime Minister's
Questions, the second time in a month that rail privatisation has
dominated proceedings. Labour leader Tony Blair said the Government was
unable to guarantee the existing level of service.
Mr Blair asked the Prime Minister: ''Will you accept that it is a
necessary consequence of setting a guaranteed level of service, below
the existing level of service, that private operators will have the
right and power to cut existing services and you will be powerless to
stop it?''
Mr Major replied that he expected private operators to respond to
demand and in many cases increase services. He added: ''It is becoming
clear that those people interested in running the service are
interested, as the Government is, in improving the service and not
leaving it in its present inadequate state.''
The PSRs were defended by Mr Salmon as ''good news for passengers''.
He added: ''They represent a solid basis on which the new railway
industry can build and provide for the first time good safeguards for a
comprehensive rail network focused on passenger needs.''
Some of the cuts proposed by Mr Salmon, which will go out for
consultation, are drastic. The Gatwick Express, which links Gatwick
Airport and Victoria Station, will have its service requirement halved,
from four trains an hour to two outside peak hours.
But the Government claims the operators will continue to provide the
existing service as a result of high customer demand. ''On comercially
driven routes I am allowing operators flexibility,'' he said.
Labour, rail unions and passenger groups all criticised the figures as
a betrayal of a Government commitment to enshrine the existing level of
services. They accused the Goverment of trying to make the franchises
attractive to bidders.
Labour transport spokesman Michael Meacher said: ''The Secretary of
State is trying to cover up for cuts being made in order to make the
franchises more saleable. He says shadow franchise directors have agreed
to maintain existing services but that will not apply to private
operators, who are not yet known.''
However, Transport Secretary Dr Brian Mawhinney denied they meant
cuts: ''Today's announcement gives a fair wind to rail privatisation.
Cuts are not the name of the game.''
He said that by setting a lower minimum service requirement on certain
routes than the existing timetable the private sector would be
encouraged ''to do what it does best -- provide additional services and
better services''.
Mr Jimmy Knapp, general secretary of the RMT rail union, said the
announcement amounted to a cut in services. ''The process is an open
invitation to franchisees to get rid of late night, early morning and
weekend services,'' he said.
Mr Lew Adams, general secretary of the train drivers' union Aslef,
said: ''You can kiss the social railway goodbye.''
The cross-party pressure group Save Our Railways said worse was to
come. Secretary Keith Bil said: ''Today we've seen the scalpel, soon
we'll see the axe.''
The four rail companies involved are: Gatwick Express, London Tilbury
and Southend, Great Western, and South West trains. All said they
intended to maintain services based on the current timetables, though
they may not end up as the successful bidder for the franchise.

THE man who created the slicked-back look for the Princess of Wales is
Scots hairdresser Sam McKnight, from New Cumnock in Ayrshire.
The London Premier Hair and Make Up agency confirmed it was the work
of McKnight, 39, reputed to be the most sought-after hairdresser around.
The Princess caused a fashion furore when she arrived at the Lincoln
Centre in New York with the new look, but McKnight was too busy at a
fashion shoot in the same city to comment on the controversy surrounding
his work.
However, insiders are convinced that it was the silvery tongued
crimper who convinced the Princess of Wales to opt for a radical image.
''McKnight is a very talented and very imaginative hairdresser,''
commented the award-winning Glasgow-based hairdresser Taylor Ferguson
yesterday. ''I'm sure it would have taken someone of his persuasive
charms to convince the Princess to try out something so new.''
McKnight, a trans-global freelance, is at the cutting edge of
contemporary styling. He is a familiar face at the top fashion shows.
British designer Vivienne Westwood insists on always using McKnight for
her catwalk shows and his clients have included Madonna, film actress
Una Thurman, and the supermodels Cindy Crawford, Linda Evangelista, Kate
Moss, and Naomi Campbell.
His association with the Princess of Wales stems from her high-profile
Vogue cover in December 91, when she appeared with a chic new look
sporting a black polo-neck and a bubbly curly crop created by McKnight.
Mr McKnight's mother Mary, 60, learned of the new look from members of
the media who swamped her home yesterday with inquiries.
When contacted by The Herald, she said: ''I am very proud of Sam.
Everyone in the village is.''

<HEADLINE>Landslide blamed as man dies in rail crash</HEADLINE>

ONE man was killed and 24 people were injured last night when two
passenger trains crashed after heavy rain caused a landslip on a remote
Cumbrian line.
The collision happened at about 7pm in torrential rain and gusting
winds on the Carlisle to Settle line at Aisgill, just south of Kirkby
Stephen.
Railtrack said the accident involved the 1626 Carlisle to Leeds train,
which was heading south but was forced to turn back at Blea Moor, by the
Ribblehorn viaduct, because of severe flooding.
The train was heading north and was a mile north of Aisgill summit
when it struck a landslip on the track and was derailed. It was then
struck by the 1745 Carlisle to Leeds service travelling south.
The accident prompted a full-scale emergency operation and about 10
ambulances were summoned from Cumbria and Yorkshire. But most of the
injured were eventually taken by a train to hospitals in Carlisle
because of poor road conditions.
An official of Cumbria Police later said it had been confirmed that
the man who died was a British Rail employee, but not a train driver.
In addition to the death there had been the two train drivers, who
were seiously injured, and 22 ''walking wounded''.
A Fire Service spokesman said one of the train drivers was trapped in
the wreckage and had to be cut free by firefighters.
He said the crash happened a considerable distance from the road and
men and equipment had to go on foot to the scene. Mountain rescue teams
were also involved.
''Because of the remoteness of the site, the injured are being
transported by a special train sent down the line from Carlisle and
taken back to Carlisle to Cumberland Infirmary in Carlisle,'' he said.
''Most of the firefighters involved in tonight's operation have been
dealing with flooding incidents throughout the day. They will have
earned their rest tonight.''
Assistant divisional fire officer Steve Wilkes, describing the scene
which greeted his firefighting team, said: ''It was pitch black, raining
very heavily, and the ground was flooded on the fell side.
''The weather conditions were atrocious -- we struggled to get to the
incident because of the floods and there was fog on the top as well.
''The two trains were quite badly damaged and completely derailed. All
the passenger compartments had concertina'd and come off the line, and
it had obviously been a fairly heavy impact. Part of the track was
involved with a landslide.
''There were two drivers who were seriously injured. We freed one
using our cutting equipment and hydraulic gear and gave first aid.
''Mountain rescue teams were mobilised to bring the injured drivers
down the fellside as they were too seriously injured to be taken to
hospital on the special train.
''The passengers had minor injuries and most were fairly calm. One or
two were in shock and there was one with a little baby. They were
treated by paramedics at the scene.''
He said farmers loaned the rescue teams three-wheeled motor bikes with
trailers which were used to shuttle equipment up and down the fell, and
also provided refreshments for the casualties.
''Accessibility of the railway line was the major problem for
everyone, with it being on such a high fell and in such bad
conditions,'' added Mr Wilkes.
Police asked worried relatives seeking information about passengers to
contact 01768 217400.
