GAVIN Hastings is emotionally and physically drained after Scotland's
historic victory against France last weekend, and he will not play for
his club today in their crucial championship game with West of Scotland
at Myreside.
Watsonians still are in with a chance of challenging Stirling County
for the Division 1 title but the decision to rest Hastings, in advance
of next weekend's Murrayfield game against Wales, was taken after
consultation with club coaches Peter Gallagher and Andrew Ker.
This will be the second league game in succession that Hastings has
missed. He sat out Watsonians' victory over Heriot's a fortnight ago on
medical advice after having received physiotherapy on his back.
The Scotland captain played one of the games of his life at Parc des
Princes last weekend, when he kicked a match-turning penalty goal and
then scored a virtuoso try before kicking the last-minute conversion
which gave Scotland their first victory on French soil since 1969.
A win over Wales on Saturday is by no means a foregone conclusion, but
victory would set up a Grand Slam showdown with England at Twickenham on
March 18.
Yesterday, Gallagher said that the decision to leave Hastings out of
the side had been taken on Thursday night after consultation with the
Scottish captain.
''Saturday in Paris was a big occasion,'' said the coach, ''and Gavin,
along with the rest of the Scottish side, played at real fever pitch.
Emotionally and physically they must all be drained, but because Gavin
was the captain and because of the personal part he played in Scotland's
win, the pressure on him was greater.
''To ask him to raise his game again for us against West, and
especially with bigger things waiting in the wings next weekend at
Murrayfield, is asking too much.
''The game against West is a big one for us. We still consider that we
are in with a chance of the title and, after much reflection, we felt it
would be fairer to Gavin if priority was given to next weekend's game
against Wales.''

MORE people than expected are using the Eurostar train service between
London and Paris but, perhaps pleasingly to the Eurosceptics, the
numbers travelling between London and Brussels is down by between 10%
and 20% on forecasts.
That has come as little surprise to Richard Edgley, managing director
of European passenger services, the UK arm of Eurostar, because Paris
sells itself much more easily to the British market.
In the three months since mid-November when the service began, it has
carried a half million passengers and between half and two thirds of
that amount are those who would normally go by air to the two European
capitals.
To stimulate Brussels traffic, a new London-Brussels weekend fare of
#79 is being introduced. To get the cheaper fare, passengers must
include a Saturday night stopover and book the ticket 14 days in
advance. The deal is #10 cheaper than the equivalent fare to Paris.
Eurotunnel, which owns the tunnel, said a record 4000 vehicles had
used the service on Thursday including 1300 lorries. Some extra traffic
has been due to a ferry dispute.
The lorry target is 2000 vehicles a day by the end of 1995.

Lahore, Friday,
ISLAMIC militants in Pakistan today chanted death threats to Prime
Minister Benazir Bhutto, two High Court judges, and the two Christians
whom they acquitted of blasphemy.
Police used tear gas and truncheons on several hundred protesters from
the majority Sunni Muslim sect in the Punjab provincial capital, Lahore,
a day after the city's High Court overturned a lower court death
sentence on the two Christians.
The marchers chanted ''Death to the High Court'', ''Hang the
blasphemers of the Prophet'', and ''Death to Benazir'' in protest
against Ms Bhutto's expressions of shock at the original death
sentences.
Masked gunmen fired in the air during a larger march by minority
Shi'ite Muslims protesting against the arrest of local leaders in Punjab
in a police crackdown against sectarian violence.
Witnesses said protesters set fire to a police post in central Lahore,
but it was unclear if they were Sunni or rival Shi'ite activists blamed
for a wave of sectarian violence.
Yesterday police arrested 33 Sunni and Shi'ite activists from groups
they accused of ''instigating religious clashes and heinous crimes'',
the official APP news agency said.
Two High Court judges had earlier acquitted Christians Salamat Masish,
14, and his uncle Rehmat Masih, 48, saying they accepted their appeal
against the death sentence for lack of evidence.
The two were convicted on February 9 on the complaint of a village
imam, or Muslim prayer-leader, who accused them of scrawling blasphemous
remarks on the wall of his mosque and on pieces of paper thrown into the
mosque.
The High Court rejected the prosecution evidence as unreliable.
A third Christian accused of the offence was shot dead as the
defendants walked out of a Lahore court in April, 1994. Rehmat and
Salamat Masih were wounded in the attack.

* THE Scottish Rugby Union patron, the Princess Royal, will perform
the opening ceremony at the picturesquely named Wooden Spoon Terraces
before the Welsh game at Murrayfield on Saturday.
SRU administrative secretary Gregor Nicholson said yesterday that the
terraces, in the West Stand and at the front of the same stand, were for
wheelchair spectators.
They accommodate 100 wheelchairs with companion seats. Financial
assistance was received from the Wooden Spoon Society, an organisation
which was set up in England a decade ago, but which was now operating in
Scotland as well.

<HEADLINE>A return pass for the exiled Cantona</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MANCHESTER United's Eric Cantona can continue playing in English
football -- but only after a lengthy spell in exile, a Football
Association disciplinary panel decided yesterday.
The three-man commission fined the Frenchman #10,000 and suspended him
from ''all football activities'' until September 30 this year after
having found him guilty of bringing the game into disrepute.
The 28-year-old Cantona already has been banned from playing until the
end of the season and fined around #20,000 by his club after allegedly
assaulting a Crystal Palace fan.
Yesterday he was summoned to the FA to explain his actions at a
disciplinary hearing, and he is due to appear before magistrates in
Croydon on March 23 charged with common assault against the fan at
Selhurst Park on January 25.
The panel consisted of FA disciplinary committee chairman Geoff
Thompson, Oldham chairman Ian Stott, and Football League president
Gordon McKeag.
The FA's public affairs director, David Davies, said: ''The members of
the Football Association Commission are satisfied that the actions of
Eric Cantona, following his sending-off in the Crystal Palace match
against Manchester United on January 25, brought the game into
disrepute.
''After having taken into consideration the previous misconduct record
of Eric Cantona, the provocation he suffered, the prompt action taken by
Manchester United, Eric Cantona's expression of regret to the
Commission, and the apologies he has offered to those affected, and the
assurances he gave as to his future conduct, the members of the
Commission have decided that Eric Cantona should be suspended forthwith
from all football activities up to and including the September 30, 1995.
In addition, Eric Cantona is fined the sum of #10,000.''
Millions saw Cantona launching a kung-fu style attack on Palace fan
Matthew Simmons, who apparently had been taunting him after he was sent
off.
Manchester United chairman and chief executive, Martin Edwards, had
appealed to the FA last night not to extend the Frenchman's suspension
beyond the end of this season.
His comments followed remarks by Cantona's French lawyer, Jean-Jacques
Bertrand, that he feared the star could receive a permanent world wide
ban from the game.
Graham Kelly, the FA's chief executive, said that Cantona had now
suffered sufficiently for his misconduct. However, he pointed out that
the FA felt restricted by Cantona's impending court case.
''Everyone understands that Eric Cantona faces a court case, has been
dealt with by Manchester United, has lost money, and lost the captaincy
of the French team,'' said Kelly. ''I don't think you could say he has
not suffered for his actions of January 25.''
Kelly stressed that Cantona had expressed strong regret for the
incident, although Cantona himself said nothing in Manchester United's
ensuing news conference.
He also revealed that the FA had already had talks with the Commission
for Racial Equality concerning the type of abuse that provoked Cantona
last month.
The FA's chief executive added that legislation could be improved to
help police take action over the initial confrontation between Cantona
and the supporter.
Meanwhile, United described Cantona's increased suspension as
''harsh'' -- but insist their French star will not appeal. Maurice
Watkins, the club's solicitor-director, who led their delegation, also
insists that Cantona will resume his career at Old Trafford when the ban
ends next season.
''There has been a comprehensive hearing of the charge today, and
Eric's case has been fully argued and examined,'' said Watkins
afterwards.
''Whilst we are naturally disappointed that the FA have felt it
necessary to increase the suspension that was promptly meted out by
Manchester United, the decision has been accepted in everyone's
interests.
''Eric has never sought to justify his actions nor to minimise their
seriousness.
''There is a right of appeal, but we have said we have accepted the
decision, so Eric will not be making an appeal.
''I have spent quite a bit of time over the last few weeks with him,
we have talked about the situation and I believe he will do his best. I
think that's also the confidence Alex Ferguson has in him.''

THERE were some who wanted the Frenchman to face the guillotine,
others who felt he had been punished enough. Somewhere in the middle of
the two extremes might have been the proper position for the FA to
adopt, but majority opinion will surely insist that the English football
chiefs showed just a touch too much compassion with a fine of #10,000
and, effectively, an extra month's playing ban. Eric Cantona,
unquestionably, got off lightly. No professional footballer who behaved
as he did at Selhurst Park in January could have expected such leniency,
nor is it reasonable mitigation to point out that he is facing a court
case for alleged assault.
Football has to be seen to sort out its own problems and under the
all-consuming and convenient banner of ''bringing the game into
disrepute'' the FA ought to have administered a suitably severe
punishment, not only to fit the ''crime'' but to put out a statement to
the non-football world that would have demonstrated how much they
abhorred his actions.
Undoubtedly they have been influenced by the prompt response of
Manchester United, who banned their man for the rest of the season and
fined him around #20,000.
However, it is the FA's job to set the pace, not follow other leads
and, while suggestions that Cantona should have been banned for life are
blood-thirsty to an extreme, the extra suspension does not look
excessive.
Perhaps the evidence which the club lawyer put before the three-man
commission contained mitigating information about the intimidation
Cantona had to endure before the incident and, indeed, the FA chief
executive, Graham Kelly, dropped some hints in that area.
Even so, in a year when English football has been sinking in a sea of
sleaze, it might have been wise to temper mercy with a little more
authority. Cantona has carved a trail of misbehaviour wherever he has
played and his reaction after being sent off at Crystal Palace was
inexcusable.
Manchester United, in particular manager Alex Ferguson, have been
supportive -- some would say far too much so -- in his time at Old
Trafford but, come September, Eric will be on his own. He had better
have learned his lesson. But will he?

THE first division clubs battling for promotion are not about to call
it a day, and neither are the chaps looking at the trapdoor which will
mean a lower station in their football careers next season.
Dunfermline, Raith Rovers, Dundee, and Airdrie have points to prove as
they return to league business today after Scottish Cup action.
Leaders Dunfermline, knocked out the cup by Airdrie, will miss the
injured Hamish French and suspended Jacky McNamara for their visit to
Ayr, revitalised after their league victory over Dundee. And for Allan
Moore, out since the first game of the season because of a knee injury,
it will be a chance for the former St Johnstone player to prove his
worth to the Fifers. For Ayr, the injured Vinnie Moore will be missing.
Dundee have lost their last three games, and manager Jim Duffy, who
will not turn out against joint-leaders Raith at Stark's Park because of
injury -- Noel Blake also is doubtful -- realises that if his squad are
to regain their confidence, there is not a better time to do it. Mike
Teasdale and Andy Cargill are added.
Raith will miss Danny Lennon because of injury.
Airdrie visit Paisley in a game where points mean prizes -- St Mirren
to avoid the drop, and Airdrie to atone for that their league defeat by
Clydebank. Tony Smith is suspended, while Saints also have defender
Steve Watson banned.
St Johnstone manager Paul Sturrock is determined that his side will
cause as much trouble as possible -- even push for promotion when it
looks as though they have a mammoth task to catch the top four. ''We
just want a good run in our next six games,'' he said.
There is one major problem in their way today at McDiarmid Park -- a
Stranraer side that refuses to give in to forecasts that they will be in
the second division next season.
Clydebank, as secretary Ian Steedman put it, finally have won one in a
row, and if the Firhill pitch survives more rain, they will face a
Hamilton side in the enviable position of not having to worry about
relegation, but most certainly are too far away from seeing premier
division football next season.
Missing for Bankies will be the suspended Scott Murdoch, with Craig
Flannigan and Derek Craig doubtful because of injury.

UNDER normal circumstances Stenhousemuir would have regarded today's
visit to Morton, a club that has tasted premier division football, as
perhaps the highlight of the season. It remains a key promotion match
but there is a danger of a feeling of anti-climax after the Warriors'
Scottish Cup victory over Aberdeen.
The fans may be hit by cup fever but manager Terry Christie will
ensure that his players keep their minds on the task of winning
promotion out of the second division. He may restore John McNiven to the
defence but otherwise we can expect a vote of confidence for the Cup
heroes.
Third-placed Morton should be unchanged for a battle between the two
best defences in the division and we cannot expect many goals this
afternoon.
A Morton victory might allow Dumbarton to go top if they can win by
two clear goals at Brechin. But the Sons have been hit by 'flu and there
are signs also that Brechin are not yet ready to accept relegation as
inevitable.
Berwick Rangers may introduce a trialist striker against East Fife.
Clyde again wait for striker George McCluskey while their visitors,
Meadowbank, have doubts about Colin Harris as well as Chris Sinclair.
Manager Mike Lawson may bring in striker Jason Young.
Stirling Albion manager Kevin Drinkell is still looking for players
but he will have to do without left-back John Gibson for the visit of
Queen of the South.
At first sight, Forfar's unbeaten home record does not seem threatened
by the visit of Albion Rovers, bottom of the third division. But Rovers
have a bit of fight in them and also will field striker Alex McEwan, a
new signing from Morton.
Lowly Arbroath, like Rovers are hinting at a revival under a new
manager and, in any case, they always enjoy making life difficult for
neighbours Montrose.
East Stirlingshire have doubts about Mike Geraghty, Gordon Russell,
and Jamie Loney as they attempt to boost their promotion challenge at
Inverness against Caley Thistle. 'Shire will do well not to lose ground.
Alloa have Willie Newbigging suspended for the visit to Cowdenbeath
who have had the better of things between the clubs in the past few
years..
With Ross McFarlane suspended, Queen's Park bring in Derek Wilson for
the visit of Ross County. Dingwall manager Bobby Wilson is likely to
make changes for the trip Hampden.

GARY Player has never been renowned for his reticence or lack of
enthusiasm throughout his long and celebrated career, but he could be
excused for his boundless effervescence last night when his Southern
African side trounced Australasia 6[1/2]-1[1/2] on the opening day of
the inuagural Alfred Dunhill Challenge.
Admittedly, US Open champion Ernie Els and his team-mates were on home
soil at Johannesburg's tree-lined Houghton Club, but not even
super-optimist Player could have anticipated such an overwhelming
advantage after the first series of fourball and foursomes matches
against opposition including the formidable Greg Norman.
Sadly for the visiting side, not only was Norman well short of his
daunting best he also had the great misfortune to run into an in-form
David Frost twice. Details:
Fourballs -- N Price and M McNulty beat W Grady and L Parsons, 2 and
1; E Els and T Johnstone beat R Allenby and M Clayton, 1 hole; R Goosen
and D Frost beat G Norman and M Campbell, 3 and 1; H Buhrmann and F
Allem lost to V Singh and F Nobilo, 6 and 5
Result -- Southern Africa 3, Australasia 1.
Foursomes -- Els and Johnstone beat Singh and Nobilo, 4 and 3; Price
and McNulty beat Clayton and G Turner, 3 and 2; Goosen and Frost beat
Norman and Allenby, 3 and 1; Allem and W Westner halved with Grady and
Campbell.
Result -- Southern Africa 3[1/2], Australasia [1/2].
Match position -- Southern Africa 6[1/2], Australasia 1[1/2].

FRASERBURGH will expect as much respect today from Huntly as Dundee
United received in the Scottish Cup last week.
The Buchan club take on the Highland League champions in a semi-final
of the Jarlaw Aberdeenshire Cup only seven days after Huntly were thrust
into the spotlight against Ivan Golac's men.
The prevailing suspicion has been that Huntly may find it tough to
motivate themselves for a return to more familiar opposition.
That may prove to be the case, but neither manager would entertain
such thoughts as they prepared for today's clash.
As holders, Huntly are aware they must retain the cup if they are to
record back-to-back trebles, and manager Steve Paterson believes that
alone will be a spur for men.
Yet, Fraserburgh have a knack of upsetting the Aberdeenshire club.
They knocked Huntly out of the Aberdeenshire Shield earlier this
season in addition to having caused some alarm in their other meetings.
In the other semi-final, Cove Rangers take on Buckie Thistle.

NIGEL Benn last night made the weight for his World Boxing Council
super-middleweight title defence without an ounce to spare.
Benn was right on 12st when he weighed-in at a Docklands hotel for his
seventh defence against American dangerman Gerald McClellan tonight at
the London Arena.
That was 3lb heavier than the former WBC middleweight champion (11st
11lb) for his first fight at the new weight.
McClellan, with 20 first-round knockouts on his record, is a clear
favourite to stop Benn, but the ''No Fear'' motive on the champion's
ski-cap summed up his mood.
Benn said: ''I'm not even worried about this fight. I've been in with
harder men -- and McClellan has a lot of nobodies on his record.
''People are saying it's going to be easy for him, that he's going to
beat me quickly, but I've got a surprise for everyone.
''I'm going in there with the intention of beating him and becoming
one of the world's best pound-for-pound fighters, along with IBF
champion Roy Jones.
''I'm really confident, after all, I'm not going in there with Mike
Tyson.''
Benn also has been known to settle an argument early. The Dark
Destroyer has piled up 13 one-round wins, but these days is more
defensively astute.
Since moving up to the 12st limit, Benn's punching has not quite
carried the ferocity of his World Boxing Organisation middleweight title
days. Indeed, four of his six WBC defences have gone the distance,
including the last three.
McClellan's gave up his WBC middleweight title because of poundage
problems, but before then he scythed his way through three challengers
in a total of 210 seconds.
Unfortunately for British boxing, it points to a quick victory for
McClellan, possibly inside three rounds.

PAUL McStay will be watching from the stand again this afternoon as
his Celtic team-mates take on Hearts at Tynecastle but his manager,
Tommy Burns, insisted yesterday that the Scottish internationalist has a
calf injury, otherwise he would have been a contender for a starting
place.
None the less, the absence of the highest paid player at the club for
the third match in a row will encourage further speculation about his
future after his contract ends this summer.
However, neither Burns -- nor Blackburn manager Kenny Dalglish --
would lend any substance to suggestions that the English Premiership
leaders would be interested in McStay if he failed to agree a new
contract.
''I have had preiminiary talks with Paul and his agent,'' said Burns,
''but we have not got down to the nitty gritty yet.
''In any case, any discussions about his contract will not be made
public by me. I will conduct talks with the player and act in the best
interests of the club.''
McStay came back to the team for the match against Motherwell after
suspension but then was dropped from the side to meet Hibs and was still
missing from the line-up against Meadowbank Thistle in the Tennents
Scottish Cup-tie last week.
''He has a calf knock which we will check in the morning but if he is
not ready he will not play. Paul has played in the past when not 100%
and, although most key players have to do that at times, they get no
thanks for it.
Burns will bring in another of his promising young men to the squad
for Edinburgh, Gary Carberry, who has been pushing hard for a chance,
but the likelihood is that he will start with the side that beat
Meadowbank.
Hearts midfielder Gary Mackay cannot remember a time when his team
beat Rangers and then Celtic inside a week and he would be a happy man
if they managed it today, following the cup win over the Ibrox side on
Monday.
However, the absence of Jim Bett and John Robertson through
suspension, added to fitness doubts about Neil Berry and John Millar,
make it a tough propostiion for the capital club.
''It is a chance for others to come in and show what they can do,''
said manager Tommy McLean, probably referring to players like Alan
Johnston and Scott Leitch.
Rangers will have Basile Boli back for the visit of Kilmarnock to
Ibrox as they try to prevent the Ayrshire team adding a third successive
defeat to follow losses to Aberdeen in the league and Hearts in the cup.
Otherwise, the team is likely to be unchanged, with Charlie Miller, who
begins a three-match suspension next week, favourite to join Gordon
Durie and Brian Laudrup up front.
''We only have the championship to focus on now,'' said manager Walter
Smith, ''and we need to get back to the form we showed in November and
December to make sure we keep our lead in the table. We have to
eradicate the errors that have cost us recently.''
Smith hopes that the next few weeks will pass without serious injury,
in which case he is confident the team can recapture the form that has
taken his team to a 14-point lead as they head towards their seventh
successive title.
Rangers have brought forward their league game with Falkirk at Ibrox
to Saturday, March 11, because both teams are out of the cup.
Kilmarnock, who are still very much involved in that competition, will
be without Tom Brown, who starts a three-game suspension, but Colin
McKee will be on from the start.
Manager Alex Totten has been able to juggle his forces to great effect
this season and is confident that his side can keep up an impressive run
of seven games without defeat, during which they have scored 15 goals.
The Rugby Park side's fine showing in the top division has made an
impact as far away as Korea where they have been invited to take part in
a tournament from June 3 to 12.
''It is a great boost for our club,'' said Totten, ''and we will be
playing against teams like the Cameroon national side, a club from
Brazil, and another from Belgium. All told, eight teams will take part
and we will be delighted to go, subject to SFA approval.''
Falkirk, who may have to build an extension to the dressing room if
they sign all the players they are chasing, will have two new men on
show against Hibs at Brockville.
Ex-Motherwell pair Steve Kirk and Paul McGrillen will make their
debuts and John Hughes returns after suspension. Manager Jim Jefferies
would like to try to tempt Maurice Johnston, of Hearts, to join the gang
at Brockville but his chnces of success are remote. However, he might
well sort out a deal to sign Gary Mackay in due course and, even
earlier, he could arrange a swop that would bring St Mirren winger David
Elliot to Falkirk.
Kevin McAllister faces a fitness test for Hibs whose midfield man
Michael O'Neill has recovered from a minor knee operation but will need
some reserve action before coming back.
Former Aberdeen stalwart Alex McLeish takes his Motherwell team to
Pittodrie where both side could do with the points. McLeish believes
Aberdeen will avoid relegation but is more concerned with his own team's
performance after their cup defeat last week. He will have new boy Eddie
May in the line-up and in the squad again are Tommy Coyne, Shaun
McSkimming, and former Aberden player Andy Roddie.
Aberdeen will be without John Inglis and Brian Grant but Stewart
McKimmie is back after injury.
Dundee United forward Paddy Connolly has suffered a broken leg for the
second time this season. The latest crack -- in exactly the same spot --
was discovered only after a second x-ray, a fortnight after he was hurt
in a reserve match against Rangers.
Connolly first broke the leg in a collision with Mike Galloway, who
yesterday made his move to Leicester City permanent, during United's
Coca-Cola Cup defeat by Celtic at Hampden on September 21.
United midfield men Jim McInally and Billy McKinlay face late fitness
tests before the relegation battle with Partick Thistle at Tannadice.

Byrne was without a club for only a few hours before Love Street
manager Jimmy Bone fixed him up and he will make his debut today against
Airdrie. Byrne said: ''I wanted the opportunity of regular first-team
football.''
Bone added: ''He is an experienced man who can help our young

* ABERDEEN and Rangers supporters in the north will get the chance to

RICHARD Corsie, already through to this afternoon's Churchill
Insurance world indoor pairs championship final in Preston, yesterday
clinched a spot in the same stage of the singles event -- for the fifth
time in seven years -- when he swept to a straight-sets success against
Norfolk's Mervyn King in the second semi-final.
Earlier, defending champion Andy Thomson had survived a 43-end
marathon -- the longest in the history of the event -- to beat world
outdoor title-holder Tony Allcock 5-7, 7-6, 6-7, 7-5, 7-4 in a really
superb match.
Corsie, who had been kept waiting for more than four hours before
taking to the green because of the long opening semi-final, started
superbly, needing just five ends to take the opening set 7-2.
He quickly established a 5-2 lead in the second but then the man from
Edinburgh saw his grip on the match slip.
''I played a couple of bad ends with a lot of short bowls,'' he said,
''and suddenly I found myself 5-6 down.''
Corsie then survived an umpire's measure on the next end to count a
single and square the set at 6-6, and another single on the next gave
him a two-sets-to-nil lead.
The Scot them went on to wrap up his final spot when he took the third
set 7-3. for a 7-2, 7-6, 7-3 victory.
Thomson, who beat Corsie in last year's final, lost the opening set
5-7 to Allcock but scraped home 7-6 in the second.
The Englishman went in front again when he landed the third set 7-6,
but a grandstand finish from the defending champion enabled him to win
the fourth set 7-5 and the decider 7-4.
''It was a cracking match and one that could have gone either way,''
said Thomson.
Corsie and Alex Marshall's opponents in this afternoon's pairs final
will be six-times former champions, David Bryant and Tony Allcock, who
went through to the final with a 5-7, 7-6, 7-6, 7-3 win over Gary Smith
and Andy Thomson last night.

STIRLING County's rise through Scottish rugby's seven divisions, to
the point that they are on the verge of becoming champions, has depended
on many things. They have one of Scotland's biggest group of sponsor
seekers, a large mini-rugby section, a dedicated women's group, a
temporary stand, vocal supporters, and some fair characters.
I phoned up Jim ''Muff'' Scobbie. Muff has played for Stirling County
in all seven divisions of the National Leagues, and now helps out with
the forwards. Iain Jarvie, who played with Muff when he was at the bold
Glasgow Accies, said he was like a ''breath of fresh air'' when he
joined the club, an unfortunate phrase given Muff's penchant for walking
up to unsuspecting team-mates in the pre-match warm-up and insisting
they sniffed his arm, which had, in his words, ''just been up a coo.''
Muff's a milk farmer.
Muff answered my phone call. He was sniffing. ''What's wrong?'' I
asked. ''Och,'' he said, ''it's just that I've been crying watching that
baseball film with Madonna in it.''
''Why, is it sad?'' I ventured.
''No,'' he said, ''I'm just crying because I canny be with Madonna.''
Like Kenny Logan, also a farmer, Muff got up early in his playing
days, even on a Saturday and sometimes at four in the morning if he was
on the milk van. He was one of the band of strong, physically strong,
people who have been at the centre of the club's success. ''Sons of the
soil,'' as McLaren would put it.
I watched some of the youngsters as they pounded the weights on
Tuesday night, in a specially adapted room at the club, and I was
impressed. No wonder they pose a handful to opposition teams that come
into contact. ''We do have a lot of very strong boys at the club,'' said
Scobbie. ''Probably the strongest, pound for pound, is Brian Ireland,
but then blokes like Kevin McKenzie are as strong as well. It's those
people that let the others, like Gareth Flockhart and Gordon Mackay,
play a bit in the loose.''
County's success goes back a long way. ''I was introduced to rugby by
Hamish Logan,'' said Scobbie. ''I went down to the club when I was 22,
and soon got into the first team. Back then we played in Division 5 of
the East Leagues, and our approach then was the same as it is now.''
Lying beside the river under the gaze of the Wallace Monument,
Bridgehaugh is one of Scotland's most picturesque grounds, but it is
without inherent wealth among its populace. ''I suppose one of the
things that has always been lacking is the public school side to us,''
said Scobbie. ''Instead of having blokes with accents, we found
ourselves as a side who welcomed newcomers who arrived, and if they knew
about rugby then we listened.''
Back in the early days, when coaching was, in many ways, still in its
infancy, the team struck lucky. ''Much of the building of the team and
the club was done by Ken Crighton back then,'' said Muff. ''He maybe
annoyed a few people along the way, but he got things done.''
Since then, Richie Dixon has helped the side, moonlighting -- in
secret -- from his Scotland job as if on some SAS mission at times, and
the side has displayed in some of its recent triumphs more than a hint
of Dixon's growing maturity as a strategist and planner.
By far the biggest loss the club has suffered was when George Graham,
their dynamic prop, went to rugby league. ''I would love to have him
back in the side,'' of course I would,'' Scobbie said. ''But we have to
look ahead, and we are always trying to find people to fill gaps.''
Many of Stirling's players, and this can be gleaned from casting an
eye along the team pictures on the clubhouse walls, have been there a
long time. Stewart Hamilton and John Gibson, to name but two, have been
playing first team rugby for over 12 seasons a piece for the club. Ian
Cosgrove, the well know Jordanhill coach, was helping out at the club
and chanced a remark that many of the pack were now playing well in the
games that he had seen. ''Aye,'' said Scobbie, ''and it's not before
bloody time too.''
No, to write off County as the nearly men of Scottish rugby might well
prove premature. As Scobbie said, they have an attitude that borders on
the ''nobody likes us and we don't care.'' But the title is within their
grasp.

RANGERS have put international sprinter Melanie Neef back on track for
the World Indoor Athletics Championships, which take place in Barcelona
from March 10 to 12.
Neef, who has re-written the Scottish sprint record books this winter,
was forced out of the 4x400 metres relay in Britain's match against
France a fortnight ago, but intensive treatment from Ibrox physio Grant
Downie has resolved a calf injury, and Neef races the 400m today at
Birmingham's KP Invitation meeting.
''Grant was a real help,'' said Neef yesterday. ''I'd torn a few
fibres, but he has sorted it out, and given me a new stretching regime
which will help in future. I've trained like a beast all week to make up
for the time I lost, so I hope I am not too tired.''
Apart from Stockholm on Monday, this is the last chance to achieve
qualifying times for the world event in Spain, Britain's team for which
is to be named on Tuesday.
Today's outcome is academic for Neef. Even should she lose her
unbeaten record at 400m indoors, she already has the required qualifying
time, as has Brian Whittle, who races the men's 400m.
John Regis also heard good news yesterday: his Barcelona path is
clear. He faces Namibian world outdoor champion Frankie Fredericks, in
an attempt on the 200m world record set by Linford Christie last Sunday.
Christie races only the 60m today, opting out of the 200m, after
treatment for a long-term back problem.
But Fredericks confirmed that whatever today's outcome, he will not
race the 200m in at the worlds. ''If I go to Barcelona, it will be for
the 60 metres. I am concerned about the bends.''
Fredericks' views -- he has become a confidant and training partner of
Christie's this winter -- suggest that Christie, though reconsidering
running in Barcelona, would, at best, do the 60m, leaving the way clear
for Regis to improve on his previous second place.
A 1500m world record attempt is in prospect, from Moroccan Hicham el
Guerrouj, in what is billed as a development race. Scotland's Grant
Graham gets a run.
* THE British under-20 squad which faces Germany in Erfurt today has
eight Scots from a total team of 48, better than any previous Scottish
representation at this level.
The 400 metres is currently Scotland's best senior event (Neef and
Whittle in the UK team). But with Hugh Kerr (Ayr Seaforth), Susan Hendry
(Aberdeen), and Allison Curbishley (Edinburgh Woollen Mill) -- three out
of a possible four quarter-milers -- the juniors have topped even that
representation.
Others in the team are Ross Baillie (60m hurdles), Andrew Young
(800m), Des Roache (1500m), Bruce Robb (shot), and Sinead Dudgeon
(200m).

THE switch to full-time swimming helped Euan Stewart gain success in
the 100 metres butterfly at last night's Speedo British Grand Prix in
Leeds.
The 25-year-old, who moved to City of Glasgow three months ago, proved
his European championship credentials by holding off a strong English
challenge to win in 57.58sec.
Stewart has yet to win a British cap, but in finishing ahead of
Sheffield pair Janko Gojkovic and Daniel Carr, he demonstrated he is on
form for the European trials.
Fraser Walker, another who has recently switched to City of Glasgow,
took the silver medal in the 50m backstroke in 28.5 behind Sheffield's
Alan Rapley. His main event is the 200m medley in which he took the
Commonwealth Games bronze medal.
Two of Scotland's most promising youngsters, Fiona Campbell (Carnegie)
and Kirsty Hope (City of Dundee) claimed bronze.
Campbell, a double Scottish champion who will make her senior debut at
the multi-nations tournament in Edinburgh in April, finished third in
the 50m breaststroke in 34.97, finishing just behind the Leeds pair, Zoe
Baker (33.77) and Rachel Plaxton (34.87).
Hope claimed her bronze behind the highly experienced British
international pair of Cathy Osher and Emma Tattam. The Scot clocked
1min.7.34sec in an event that Aberdeen's Nicola Steel finished sixth in
1-8.12.
Milngavie and Bearsden' Tom Griffith completed the Scottish medal
tally with bronze in the 50m freestyle. The 21-year-old touched in 24.99
behind Alan Rapley and Nick Williams.
Double Olympian Alison Sheppard finished fourth in the 200m freestyle.

THE stage is set tomorrow at Perth for what promises to be a dramatic
head-to-head shoot-out between the two top curling teams Scotland has
produced in the last decade.
David Smith's Perth team of David Hay, Peter Smith, and Graeme Connall
-- world champions in 1991 -- will face current European champions,
Hammy McMillan's Stranraer team of Rodger McIntyre, Mike Hay and Norman
Brown in the Macallan Challenge Skins game with a total of #5000 up for
grabs.
The skins format has been imported from Canada to provide what should
be an aggressive game. Part of the cashpot will go to the winners of
each end. If either team blanks an end it will be penalised and
scoreless ends will provide roll-over jackpots, raising the stakes. A
time clock will also count down during play for each team.
Although this gladiatorial format has been devised to produce
entertaining television this will be no freak show. The Smith and
McMillan teams can boast more than a hundred medals at Scottish,
European and World levels, in both junior and senior events between
them. No other Scottish sporting encounter will produce a higher
standard of competitor.
The event is the latest initiative by The Curlers' Association, the
recently formed players' body that is determined to improve the state of
the sport in Scotland.
Originally, this weekend was scheduled for an event organised by the
Royal Caledonian Curling Club but legal difficulties encountered by the
sponsor and unconnected with the event caused its collapse. The Curlers'
Association was quick to secure sponsorship from Macallan whisky and tie
up a television deal.
The Challenge gets under way at 2pm, but a full programme starts at
11.30am.

JONATHON Masterton, a former Scottish junior cap, secured a meeting
with former British champion Paul Gregory following a convincing
first-round win in last night's Stewart Milne Construction North of
Scotland Open in Aberdeen.
The home club's No.1 league player beat Malcolm Forbes 9-5, 9-5, 4-9,
9-4.
Gregory, the world No.18, had a bye through to today's second round,
as did fellow Englishman and No.1 seed, Tony Hands.
Scottish under-19 caps Gavin Grant and Allan Tasker also were
convincing winners. Grant defeated West Lothian's Colin McMullan 9-1,
9-6, 9-2 to set up the biggest day of his career. Grant, from Inverurie,
now meets Scotland's No.2 and world No.36, Martin Heath. Tasker's for a
9-2, 9-7, 9-5 win over the home club's Richard Irvine is a match against
this season's top domestic player, Barry Sutherland.
Sutherland and Heath are the only Scottish seeds in the high quality
field, but Heath is confident of securing a home victory.
In the women's North Open, top seeds Claire Waddell the Scottish
champion, and world No.16 Senga Macfie, both make their debuts today.
In the women's event, Julie Nicol marked her comeback from illness
with a 9-0, 9-2, 9-0 win over Isobel McMullan. She now meets current cap
Wendy Maitland in the quarter-finals. Results:
Men. First round -- G Clark (Bridge of Allan) beat K Milne (Ellon)
9-3, 6-9, 8-10, 9-1, 9-0; R McIntosh (Aberdeen University) beat R
Warnock (Aberdeen) 10-8. 9-6, 9-5; A Tasker (Kirkcaldy) beat R Irvine
(Aberdeen) 9-2, 9-7, 9-5; G Stewart (Aberdeen) beat D Bird (Abderdeen)
6-9, 5-9, 9-5, 9-4, 9-7; G Grant (Skean Dhu) beat C McMullan (West
Lothian) 9-1, 9-6, 9-2; G Thomson (Colinton Castle) beat C Thompson
(Aberdeen) 9-3, 10-8, 6-9, 9-7; J Masterton (Aberdeen) beat M Forbes
(Glasgow) 9-5, 9-5, 4-9, 9-4.
Women. First round -- T Maitland (Westhill) beat N Broad (Aberdeen)

STIRLING County, in their continuing quest for the club's first
Division One title, are in the final straight. They can see the winning
post but there are tricky hurdles to negotiate before they can call the
championship their own.
Today at Bridgehaugh, where they entertain Boroughmuir, they are
confronted by the trickiest of the lot. Stirling can be assured of the
title if they beat the men from Meggetland, but only if West of Scotland
overcome second-placed Watsonians at Myreside.
West's chances are given a significant boost by the withdrawal of
Scotland captain Gavin Hastings from the 'Sonians side. Hastings is said
to be ''emotionally and physically'' drained after his exertions at the
Parc des Princes last weekend and he is saving himself for the Scots'
encounter with the Welsh at Murrayfield on Saturday.
The Stirling County v Boroughmuir clash is given added spice by virtue
of the fact that the two sides' fortunes are guided by the coaching
brothers Edwards.
Younger brother Brian is at the Bridgehaugh helm while Henry is in
charge at Meggetland. Until a fortnight ago Boroughmuir were still in
the championship hunt, but then they came an unexpected cropper against
Edinburgh Academicals. They still have a significant hand to play,
though, and brotherly love will be laid aside for 80 minutes as
Boroughmuir seek to salvage something from yet another ''might have
been'' season.
Stirling County captain Stewart Hamilton is under no illusions about
the magnitude of the task which faces his side today. He said: ''This is
a big, big game. They don't come any bigger. We had a good session on
Thursday night and all the boys are up for it. The way things have
worked out in the leagues over the last few Saturdays have turned it
into a real nail-biter.
''It looked at one stage as if we were home and dry and then we lost
to Hawick. Then Boroughmuir lost to Edinburgh Accies and Watsonians are
still in there with a shout,'' he said.
Stirling are two points to the good with three games to play and a
postponed game in hand over the chasing Watsonians. However, Hamilton,
at 38 and with a birthday to celebrate on Tuesday, knows there is no
room for complacency.
The Parc des Princes injury to Stirling centre Ian Jardine has dealt a
body blow to his club. Jardine has been instrumental in the Bridgehaugh
campaign and today his place goes to Scotland under-18 cap Russell
Kennedy.
Hamilton, who in a previous championship race vowed to cut out the
cigars until the trophy was locked securely away in the Bridgehaugh
clubhouse, said: ''Ian is obviously going to be a big miss. He plays
such an important part in the side. He plays a part in just about every
move that we have in the backs, or with the back-row.
''Young Russell Kennedy will do OK, though. He had a real gleam in his
eye at training on Thursday. He has come up through the ranks with Matt
McGrandles and last season he got a few games in the First XV ahead of
Matt.''
Boroughmuir coach Henry Edwards was yesterday left contemplating what
might have been if his side had not lost to Edinburgh Accies. They had
played superbly well to overcome Melrose and Watsonians and were
involved in a serious hunt for the title.
''I think it's a psychological thing with us. We have been in this
position before. We were getting a lot of media attention and I think a
lot of the boys weren't focused on the game.''
He said, though, that brotherly love will be left on the sidelines for
80 minutes at Bridgehaugh today. ''We are both desperate to win. Brian
wants to win for obvious reasons but, with the league season coming to
an end, we want to make sure that we finish on a high note.''
Elsewhere in division one a nail-biting battle continues. A top-eight
finish is crucial if club's are to appear in the new premier division
next season.
GHK, Hawick, and Gala occupy seventh, eight, and ninth slots
respectively and each is on 11 points. Fireworks are in store, then, at
Old Anniesland, where GHK entertain the Braw Lads from Gala. Hawick have
the easier task at home to relegated Stewart's-Melville FP.
In divison two the big game is at Philiphaugh where Kelso and Selkirk,
Border rivals and the top two sides in the division are the big draw.

TOM Brodie, managing director of Glasgow Brickyard, thought he was
being wound up when a business acquaintance joked that he was favourite
to win the 4.20 at Musselburgh. He couldn't believe anyone would name a
horse Tom Brodie, but there it was in black and white, and it was indeed
the favourite at 2-1.
Showing a turn of speed few thought he had, he hot footed it down to
Ladbrokes to place a bet. ''Well, I might have been accused of not being
willing to bet on myself if I hadn't,'' he pointed out.
He began to get an uneasy feeling when he discovered that the drivers
of his eight-strong fleet of lorries had also made for the bookies. If
the horse lost, he realised, some flak would be flung in his direction.
But he needn't have worried -- the thoroughbred romped home in first
place.
Brodie is now making plans to visit the horse at its stables in
Carlisle, to give it some hay and say his own personal thank you. He is
also hoping to get a photo of the two Tom Brodies together, but he
should be careful -- someone might ask the real Tom Brodie to step
forward.
Lone legal eagles
flock together
SOLE legal practitioners are having a tough time of it. It seems
building societies are reluctant to have them on their panels for
conveyancing work.
Edinburgh lawyer Brian Smith, however, has decided to do something
about this state of affairs. He called a meeting of sole practitioners
in the capital, and 35 out of a possible 40 turned up.
The meeting agreed to form a network of sole practitioners in the city
to help cover each other for holidays, and also use their combined
buying power to purchase items such as stationery.
They are now planning to use their collective weight to convince the
Law Society that it should do more for firms of this type.
Once the Edinburgh branch of the sole practitioner network is
operating smoothly, Smith plans to organise a similar meeting in Glasgow
to form one covering the West.
The Law Society had better watch out, for these single member firms
make up around 40% of its membership, and it could be the wee boys are
about to give the big boys a fright!
Seminar caught
in a timewarp
I RECEIVED an invite from Playfair-Walker to attend a Digital Graphics
and PrePress exhibition at CGC Graphic Centre in the Murrayfield stadium
conference centre yesterday.
Being a hi-tech buff (cough) I was more than a little interested and
glanced at the programme of keynote presentations. One immediately
caught my eye -- on High Definiton Digital Camera PrePress -- and then I
spotted the timing: 1.45am. You would have to be keen to attend that, I
thought. I also spotted: The RISC Revolution -- PowerMac Now and Future
at 11.30pm.
I just hope no one reading this paper was wandering around Murrayfield
at 11.30pm and 1.45am looking for the night owl seminars, as the
exhibition ran from 10.45am until 4pm. There was obviously a slight
hiccup in the hi-tech setting and reading process when the programme was
prepared.
Mind you, with the upsurge in breakfast meetings, it could be that
late night seminars will become the in thing, with people leaving them
for breakfast meetings at, say, 7am.
Mixing business
with breakfast
TALKING of breakfast meetings, Glasgow City Council leader Pat Lally
was in good form at the Moat House Hotel earlier this week, when he
addressed a gathering of business men and women on the opportunities
lying ahead as a result of Glasgow winning the City of Architecture and
Design 1999 award.
He began by sending ''his condolences'' to the ''other city'' for
losing out. The smile which crossed his face at this point gave the
impression this might have been rather tongue in cheek.
The absence of Walter Hecht, joint managing partner of Walkers
chartered accountancy firm, was noted because he had the misfortune to
have a seat reserved next to your Business Diary correspondent.
Checking on why Hecht, who is known for his participation in events
such as 30-mile cycle runs, had failed to turn up, Business Diary was
given a tale of woe of domestic mishaps caused by heavy rainfall.
He did, however, inform Business Diary of another breakfast meeting
which he is supporting in aid of the Scottish Council for Spastics on
March 23. Tom Farmer, chairman of Kwik-Fit Holdings, will be speaking on
how Business Can Be Fun.
This business breakfast is being sponsored by Bowring Marsh &amp;
McLennan. Individual tickets priced at #30 or corporate tables of 10 for
#300 can be purchased from Wendy Robbins, the national events organiser
at the Scottish Council for Spastics in Edinburgh. The event starts at
7am in the Moat House International, Glasgow, with a Bucks Fizz
reception to wake you up.
I don't know what the hotels would do if we all stopped going for
breakfasts.
Language barrier
on the cards
PROFESSOR J Ross Harper is a busy man these days as president of the
International Bar Association. He is just back from Japan, where he was
making representations to high ranking government officials in the
Ministry of Justice and Foreign Office departments about the country's
''system of detention''.
It seems Japan has a 90.99% conviction rate for those who are accused
of crimes, helped by a 95% confession rate! Puzzled by how the Japanese
could be so successful in persuading those suspected of committing
crimes to confess, I tried to contact Professor Harper, but I had missed
him. He is at this moment in Vienna, and after that is off to Nigeria.
For his visit to Japan, he had his business card printed in Japanese
and was amused to see that the J appeared as normal because, he was
told, the Japanese don't have one.
What about Japan then?
Speedy way to
break the law
AN IRATE businessman contacted Business Diary this week armed with a
leaflet he had found under his car's windscreen wiper in Blythswood
Square, Glasgow.
He was upset by the contents which advertised a new ''Laser Radar
Detector'' for #179.95. The leaflet explained, under the heading
''Reduce your speed . . . NOW'', that the ''Cheetah'', as the machine is
called, ''detects X, K super wide band Ka and laser guns/cameras''. It
goes on to say that it can monitor a laser gun/camera outside its own
range, therefore, detecting it before it detects you.
What finally turned the businessman's stomach was the statement at the
foot which said: ''Cheetah Advanced Car Products Ltd in no way condone
or incite anti-social behaviour''.
There was, however, one important statement included which those
tempted to buy such machines should note: ''Under the 1949 Telegraphy
Act the use of radar detectors may contravene the Act.''
Strathclyde Police confirmed this, and said that anyone caught with
such a device would have it confiscated.
Last word to my contact, who wrote: ''The bottom line about not
condoning anti-social behaviour does not sit comfortably with the sales
pitch, unless one is meant to buy the gadget for the mantlepiece or the
china cabinet!'' Enough said.
Fish and chips
by floodlight
THE Glasgow and West of Scotland Society for the Blind was delighted
with the #150 raised by the Scottish Tourist Guides Association when it
held a charity floodlit tour of Glasgow on Monday night.
Harry Ramsden's fish restaurant also had good reason to be pleased for
the Guides Association has organised 105 floodlit tours since October
and they all end up there for a fish tea!

PETER Niven forsakes the glamour of the two big televised meetings at
Kempton and Haydock this afternoon for five mounts at Edinburgh.
And the Scots jockey, fifth in the jump riders' championship table on
69 winners, has a chance on all five.
He rides Kenilworth Lad in the novices chase and Master Flashman in
the novices hurdle for his retainer Mary Reveley. In the opening maiden
hurdle, which has been divided, Niven partners Know-No-No, in division
one and then Pagliaccio for Micky Hammond.
In the Scottish Racing Club's Chase he partners Integrity Boy for
Nigel Tinkler, while Lambourn trainer Charlie Brooks sends two up from
Berkshire, Mr President, in the maiden hurdle, and Roc Color, in the
feature race, the Edinburgh University Turf Club's Chase.
* GAELSTROM is set to return from a long lay-off at Wetherby on
Wednesday. She is likely to line up in a limited handicap in preparation
for a run at the Cheltenham Festival.
The 1993 Sun Alliance Novices' Hurdle winner trotted up in her first
two starts over fences at Cheltenham early last season.
But she subsequently fell at Worcester and has not been seen out since
having been withdrawn lame at the start in December, 1993.
''I will need to look at the weights and the other entries but she
might well run at Wetherby,'' said trainer Nigel Twiston-Davies.
''She fractured a hind-leg at Worcester last season but is fully
recovered and in good form now. We hope to run her in the Cathcart at
Cheltenham.''
* JOCKEY Ray Cochrane starts a six-day suspension on Monday after his
appeal against the ban was turned down by the Jockey Club disciplinary
committee yesterday.
Cochrane was banned by the Wolverhampton Stewards who recently judged
him guilty of irresponsible riding when his mount, Dynamis, was found to
have interfered with Jon's Choice, ridden by Trevor Wall.
* DONCASTER'S executive have increased the prize money on offer for
their pre-Cheltenham meeting on Saturday, March 4.
Two handicap chases will benefit by having their value increased by
#7000, with the Grimthorpe Chase profitting most.

LET us imagine an unlikely situation within the Scottish business
community: a conference where a number of high achievers stand up in
front of other business people and talk about their secrets of success.
Never! We're not like that here. We prefer to keep these things to
ourselves -- it has been hard enough accumulating the precious knowledge
in the first place without giving it away for free.
But times are changing. Next Monday and Tuesday three well-known
business people will talk about how they did it to an audience of 50
others at a pioneering event at Gleneagles Hotel. They are Gio
Benedetti, rapidly becoming one of the best-known faces of this new
entrepreneurial generation we are developing in Scotland, Ken McCulloch,
probably our most enterprising restaurateur and hotelier, and Bill
Fleming, founder of the Smiley Tyres and Exhausts chain, who has become
a business angel.
The event is called Entrepreneurs for Entrepreneurs and it is the
inaugural appearance in public of a new organisation, the Entrepreneurs'
Exchange. Based in Lanarkshire but with a national focus, it has been
created to act as a melting pot for ideas and people.
A significant symbol of its purpose is the fact that those two
long-standing business rivals Tom Farmer and Bill Fleming have joined
forces to head it. Fleming, the chairman, invited Farmer to become its
president.
Topics at Gleneagles include identifying actions to boost personal and
business development, whether entrepreneurs are born or made, and, of
course, how people like Gio Benedetti made their millions.
Benedetti is already becoming a practised speaker on enterprise. I
must, however, claim credit for first putting him on a platform, all of
five years ago, when he talked to a seminar we had organised on How To
Sell Your Business.
Given that he had just, as the current Irvine Development Corporation
ads point out, flogged his industrial cleaning business to BET for a
cool #13m, he had his audience in the palm of his hand as he explained,
with typical Italian panache, how he drove the smooth southerners
towards a deal.
Today, we have a growing number of business people, owner-managers,
capitalists, call them what you will, willing to talk about their
experiences in the interests of generating further entrepreneurial
activity.
In fact, 1995 has been designated Year of the Entrepreneur by Scottish
Enterprise. It has set out a programme of events and initiatives
including a major conference in June. The level of debate about how we
can best help more people into business in Scotland has been raised
significantly these past two years. So, too, has the degree of
appreciation of what makes businesses succeed.
Perhaps the single most important aspect of this accelerating movement
is that it has shed light on why more Scots don't start their own
companies. It is not the fear of failure everyone once thought, but more
a fear of success. There does appear to be a widespread, deeply held,
and almost moralistic bias against the sort of activities and attitudes
involved in achieving success, from taking hard decisions about people
to out-manoeuvring the competition.
That is an attitude we must tackle. People need to become more
comfortable with the idea of being part of a business success story. All
the networking and rubbing of shoulders that will take place at
Gleneagles is intended to help achieve just that.
* Alastair Balfour is managing director of The Insider Group.

<HEADLINE>New system of direct contracts.  Tesco gives a boostto Scottish farmers</HEADLINE>

THE Tesco supermarket group has promised that Scottish farmers will
enjoy a significant increase in trade following their acquisition of the
Dundee-based Wm Low supermarket chain.
Its announcement yesterday of a new system of direct contracts with
farmers included an undertaking that there would be opportunities to bid
for business supplying stores in the merged group both north and south
of the Border.
Earlier this week, Tesco had caused some disappointment when it
indicated that it would no longer market meat products under the Farm
Assured Scotch Livestock label. They have opted, instead, for their own
in-house logo featuring the Scottish Saltire.
Yesterday's announcement, however, could mean increased trade for
Scottish-based producers.
''What has happened with the takeover by Tesco of Wm Low in Scotland
is that the volume going through those Wm Low stores is now
significantly higher than it was before,'' said Tesco director John
Gildersleeve.
''The volume that we are taking from the Wm Low supply base is more
significant than it was before and we have created opportunities for
many of those Scottish producers now not only to supply those former Wm
Low stores with increased volume, not only to supply Tesco stores that
were already in Scotland but indeed to supply the rest of the Tesco
stores in England and Wales.''
With 500-plus stores throughout Britain, including 50 in Scotland,
buying in about #5000m worth of farm produce a year, Mr Gildersleeve
said Scottish agriculture would enjoy a significant increase in trade
throughout the group this year.
One Scottish grower -- Robin Drysdale of Cockburnspath, near Dunbar,
who specialises in turnips for the retail trade -- will be at the
forefront of a new trial contract scheme announced in London yesterday.
Tesco said it is the first food retailer to introduce direct contracts
with farmers.
This follows an analysis of the group's supply/demand profile for
fresh produce carried out by the Agricultural Development and Advisory
Service. This pinpointed two major weaknesses: poor programming to
ensure the right supplies at the right time and pricing policy.
The new trial producer contracts, involving four growers and three
field vegetable crops, are designed to smooth out these problems. Buying
programmes will be linked to farm planning at an early stage and the
contract will cover 85% of the grower's produce at a minimum price
agreed before the start of the season.
The contract provides for profit-sharing if there is a retail price
boom. There are no penalties for failing to meet contracted volume or if
there is a retail price slump.
If the trial is successful it will be rolled out to other producers
and other crops.
Mr Gildersleeve added: ''We know that some growers perceive an
imbalance of strength in the marketplace between themselves and food
retailers. We hope we can now change that perception and provide the
producer with a framework within which he can feel more secure and
improve his business planning.''

THE newly formed Monklands Business Forum gets off the ground on
Monday night with a dinner in the Tudor Hotel in Airdrie.
An annual subscription costs #130, which covers nine dinners to be
held throughout the year. According to chairman Louise Stewart, they
will be addressed by ''high-quality professional speakers''.
The two speakers for Monday night are The Herald's Economics Editor
Alf Young and entertainer Andy Cameron.
At this point I was tempted to say ''what a couple of comedians'', but
then I thought I might upset Andy Cameron with such a remark.
Only joking, of course, as I would not like to offend the ''man
above'', as he usually is. He's taking the day off today, but when he
reappears next week in his usual place on the top half of this page,
above Business Diary, he might squeeze me out all together.
At each Forum meeting four local companies will be afforded a
promotional spot for their businesses.
Membership is limited to 200, and anyone interested should contact
Monklands Business Forum at the Coatbridge Business Centre in Main
Street, Coatbridge, tel: 01236 423281.

<HEADLINE>Problems for dairy industry as US targets export markets</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>ROBERT ROSS, FARMING EDITOR</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>24</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>979681400</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
PROBLEMS for the dairy industry throughout Europe have been forecast
by an Ayrshire milk producer, concerned at loss of export markets and
looming surpluses with the European Union.
Mr Robert Lamont, Cumnock, told the Ayr executive of the National
Farmers Union of Scotland: ''I think in the next two or three years we
are going to see real problems. The picture is far from bright''
The US, he said, were operating a dairy exports incentive programme
targeting what had been tradition EU export markets in the middle-east.
In three years from 1990 the American share of the world market in the
dairy sector had gone up from 1.2% to 6.7%. With the enlargement of the
EU from January 1 there was now an eight per cent increase in milk
surpluses within the union.
The executive heard, however, that plans were proceeding for the
establishment of the Milk Development Council which would have a role in
promoting dairy products. Farmers are being asked to pay a levy which
would create a #5.4m fund which could be used to to support sales
promotion -- but not generic advertising.
Mr Tom Reid, convener of the Ayr executive's milk committee said that
in the current atmosphere, when there appeared to be so much bias
against farming, one way forward would be to encourage school children
to visit farms ''and see the true picture.''
However, education authorities were faced with financial problems and
school trips had been identified as an area for economies, he said. One
suggestion discussed at the NFU's national milk committee had been for
farmers to meet the cost of buses to bring children out to the farms, he
said. That would be a decision for individual farmers to take.
The executive remained concerned at the activities of animal rights
protestors. Local president John Scott said he suspected that the
genuine protestors had now been joined by what he described as
''professional anarchists.''
Mr Ian Kerr, Kilmarnock, said he belived that the protests were being
pushed by the vegetarian lobby who were running a very well orchestrated
campaign against the livestock industry and animal husbandry as a whole.
In reality, he said, vegetarianism was as unnatural as cannibalism --
''and yet here we are in a situation where the whole livestock industry
is being threatened by a small minority.''
The danger of falling into the trap of name-calling was argued by Mr
Alan Parker who said that anyone was entitled to be vegetarian. ''What
we want to see is people being free to choose,'' he said. ''At the
moment it appears that the vegetarian lobby will not be happy until meat
is regarded as the 'unusual' option. I do not want the extinction of one
view or the other.''
He hoped that the NFUS was looking ahead and preparing plans to tackle
the issue on a broad base. ''Or are we just going to fight them as they
come?'' he asked.

<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>24</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>979681401</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THREE Scottish Pride creameries in the West of Scotland are to close
down operations from Wednesday of next week, for a month -- ''to improve
efficiency''.
But the move has caused concern among farming communities and creamery
staff on the Isle of Bute, Arran, and in Campbeltown on the Kintyre
Peninsula. All believe that the future of local cheese production is at
risk.
The move by Scottish Pride will also mean higher transport costs for
farmers who will be forced to send their milk to mainland outlets while
the plants are shut.
James Hosea, chief executive of Scottish, claims that the closures are
necessary if the creameries are to increase their performance. He said:
''We operate our creameries throughout the year which is an exception to
the rule as the former Milk Marketing Board was committed to taking
members' milk production on a daily basis.
''Recognising the competitive market we are in today it is important
that we improve our operating efficiency if we are to increase profits
and expand our market share.''
Mr Hosea said he was aware that the closures would mean additional
costs for farmers. Workers at the creameries are either being asked to
take their annual holidays next month or carry out maintenance and
repair work.
Mrs Evelyn Mundell of the Clyde and West Area Scottish Milk producers
said she was disturbed at hearing the closure announcements. ''The
previous Milk Marketing Boards were the most efficient way of milk
collection. This move by Scottish Pride, which must be put in the
context of the de-regulation of the milk industry, will mean
considerable additional costs for farmers faced with hauling milk off
the islands,'' she said.
Alastair McFarlane, president of the Bute Branch of the National
Farmers' Union said he was now worried by the lack of commitment from
Scottish Pride and the reasons given for the month's closures. He said:
''We've been kept totally in the dark by Scottish Pride and I have never
heard of three creameries ever being shut for a month at a time. This is
an unusual move in this industry, and we are very concerned.''

<TEXT>
THE chairman of Scottish Milk, Mr Andrew Howie, has announced his
decision to retire from the company's board in July. Another board
member, Mr Fraser R Evans, will stand down at the same time.
Mr Howie had served for 13 years as chairman of the former Scottish
Milk Marketing Board and, on deregulation, oversaw the transition from
the board to the fledgeling Scottish Milk Limited -- a farmers'
co-operative. He became the first chairman of the new company on its
formation last year.
He explained yesterday that if the old SMMB had continued he would
have been required to retire from that chairmanship last year on
reaching the age of 70. Because of deregulation that requirement had
been waived in the interests of continuity. Mr Evans was also retiring
under the age limit regulations, said Mr Howie.
The managing director of Scottish Milk, Mr Jack Pirie, said that Mr
Howie had been an outstanding leader of the dairy industry during a
period of dramatic change.
Members of the co-operative have been invited to nominate candidates
for the two vacancies on the board. A general meeting will be held on
July 19.

HERALD readers are being offered the chance to attend an investment
evening on personal equity plans.
A panel of experts drawn from Save and Invest, M&amp;G, Murray Johnstone
and Fidelity will answer questions from the audience after making brief
presentations.
The PEP evening, which is being hosted by the Herald, will take place
at the Marriott Hotel, Glasgow, on Tuesday, March 21.
Admission is free, and tickets can be obtained by completing the
coupon advertisement at the bottom of this page.
The event will be of special interest to the 20,000 readers who
entered our PEP competition at the end of last year.
PEPs were first launched in 1987 and offer investors a shelter from
tax on dividends and capital gains. More than #15bn has been lodged in
them so far.
Individuals are entitled to invest up to #6000 in a general PEP each
year and a further #3000 in a single company one.
The flexibility and tax efficiency PEPs offer has resulted in them
being used for a wide range of investment purposes, including repaying
the capital borrowed on a mortgage.

SCOTTISH Amicable is launching a guaranteed personal equity plan which
will provide investors with a fixed rate of tax-free income until the
end of the year 2000, when the return of the original capital is
guaranteed. The PEP will be placed in a new investment trust which will
invest 70% in equities and the balance in fixed-interest securities.
The return will be announced on March 6 and will depend on frequency
of payment and size of investment made. The offer period will straddle
the tax year-end, enabling people to maximize their PEP investment.
Instead of taking income it can be rolled up, though this choice has to
be made at the outset and cannot be changed.
NATIONWIDE Building Society is offering a guaranteed income bond
giving a return equivalent to the rise in the FTSE-100 index over five
years or 25%, whichever is the greater.
FIDELITY Investments has launched a PEP fund to take advantage of the
changed rules in the new tax year. When they are in force the fund will
be invested 75% in fixed-interest corporate bonds and 25% in equities.
Charges will be 3% initial and 1.25% annual, taken from income.
SCOTTISH Life is offering mortgages through financial advisers fixed
at 6.99% until April 1998. There will be no compulsion for borrowers to
buy household insurance through the society.
FIDELITY Brokerage has a special ''bed and breakfast'' deal available,
with commission charged on the sale transaction only and the repurchase
performed free.
LATEST mortgage rates from Halifax Building Society include a
first-time buyer rate which has been fixed at 5.99% until April 1997.

SHARES in the United Friendly insurance group soared 127p to 640p at
one point yesterday after it said that it had received official approval
to distribute the surplus in its life funds to shareholders and
policyholders.
However, suggestions that this could prove controversial with
policyholders who may contest the amount to go to shareholders took off
some of the gloss and the B shares closed 92p better at 605p.
Former paid-up policyholders may also try to intervene by saying that
the surplus comes partly from their investment and that they should
receive part of it.
Other insurance stocks reacted according to how similar they are to
United with Britannic up 71p at 510p and Refuge 39p better at 320p.
However, Legal &amp; General shares were just 6p stronger at 448p and
Prudential 9p at 308[1/2]p.
As a result of an investigation started in March 1993 and involving
actuaries Tillinghast and solicitors Slaughter &amp; May, it has been
decided that assets worth #275m be transferred to shareholders while all
industrial branch and with profits ordinary branch life policyholders
will benefit to the extent of #74.1m with another #8.2m being
transferred to the profit and loss account.
The value of the long-term business funds at the end of 1994 were
estimated as being in excess of #2000m.
The bonanza is equivalent to a boost to shareholders of about 335p per
share and well above most expectations although only a portion will be
distributed through dividends.
Some of the surplus is being held back to support the continued growth
of the business as well as to smooth the long term investment return.
Costs arising from the mis-selling of pensions and opt-outs will be
borne by shareholders.
Policyholders will be encouraged that not only will 1993 bonus rates
be generally maintained for 1994 in contrast to most offices which are
cutting them but that they will benefit from the special #82.3m
distribution in respect of 1994 while terminal bonuses on policies
maturing in 1995 will be increased.
The scheme has the approval of the Department of Trade and Industry
and this is only the second time that permission has been granted for
such a move. London &amp; Manchester took a similar step which ended with a

20% annually for the next few years.

FURTHER evidence that Britain is in the midst of an export-led
recovery emerged yesterday when official figures revealed a much
lower-than-expected January trade deficit with non-EU countries.
The figures were published hours after the latest CBI monthly trends
survey found that export order books were at their highest ever level.
The latest trade figures were the first to take account of the EU's
expansion to include Sweden, Finland and Austria. The Central
Statistical Office said that the historic data had been adjusted to take
acount of the new definition of the EU, but further revisions could be
expected.
In December, the deficit had trebled to #903m, and the City had
expected trade to be #600m in the red last month. In the event the
figure came in at just #303m.
Even more impressive was the core deficit, excluding oil and erratic
items. This shrank from December's #762m to #138m, the smallest monthly
shortfall since January 1988.
Between December and January exports increased by 4% to #4941m, while
imports fell by 7.5% to #5244m. The volume of exports, excluding oil and
erratics, rose by 6.5% and import volumes fell by 10%.
The December deficit sticks out like a sore thumb from the recent run
of figures, but unless it turns out to be an aberration the trend would
seem to be deteriorating as the recovery sucks in more imports.
Manufacturing investment, for so long in the doldrums, seems to be
picking up again. Since the UK does not have much of a capital goods
industry this is bound to have an adverse effect on trade figures.
In the three months to January, the non-EU deficit more than doubled
to #1815m from #895m in the previous three months. By value, exports
were just 0.6% higher over the period, but imports advanced by 4.6%.
Compared with the same three months a year ago, exports increased by
8.3% and imports by 5.5%.
The volume of exports, including oil and erratics, rose by 1.8%
between the latest two three-monthly periods. The increase for imports
was 5.2%.
Against the same three months a year ago, core exports were 8% higher,
and imports 0.5% lower.
Britain's trading position improved dramatically in 1994, but towards
the end of the year there were signs of a moderate deterioration. The
non-EU figures give an increasingly partial picture of the trade
balance.
EU figures are published in arrears. Since the advent of the single
market in 1993 they are compiled from VAT returns instead of customs
declarations.
The next set of worldwide trade figures, for December, will be
published on March 10. The betting is that the 1994 global trade deficit
will be about #9500m, slightly higher than the Treasury's Budget
forecast of #9000m, but a big improvement on the #13.4bn recorded in
1993.
The Treasury also forecast that the overall deficit would fall further
to #6500m this year. This reflects the large export gains made last year
before imports started to recover.
Even if this does not turn out to be the case, the trade deficit is
not a restraint on the sustainability of the recovery. However, fears
were being expressed yesterday that booming exports could prevent the
economy slowing down in response to the squeeze on domestic consumption
through higher taxes and interest rates.
James Capel's Adam Cole described the overnight CBI survey as being
''highly bullish on activity''. Exports to rapidly recovering
Continental European markets (not covered by yesterday's figures) are
particularly strong.
Mr Cole calculated that if manufacturers' price expectations are
realised in full, factory gate inflation could hit 7% later this year.
The CBI itself, never one to encourage the authorities to push up
interest rates, is forecasting the base rate stabilising at 7.5% later
this year against the current 6.75%. But futures markets are pointing to
rates peaking at around 9% next year.
One puzzle in the diet of economic data earlier in the week was the
gap between retail sales (0.2% higher) and consumer spending (0.6%
higher) in the final quarter of last year.
Spending on travel, holidays and eating out are among the factors
which could account for the discrepancy, which is even greater than it
appears because mild weather reduced consumption of electricity and gas.

<HEADLINE>Minister plans revamp ofbuilding society services</HEADLINE>

THE Government is proposing to unshackle the building societies from
many of the existing restrictions which will enable them not only to
compete more freely with the banks but also enhance members' rights.
Treasury Minister Anthony Nelson said yesterday that legislation will
be set in course to allow building societies to widen the range of
services they can offer beyond the traditional mortgages and deposit
taking.
However, they are still required to focus primarily on providing
housing finance and that at least 50% of funds must come from members.
That allows them to increase the amount borrowed from the wholesale
markets from 40% to 50% and which at times can prove cheaper than retail
deposits.
Although the societies will be able to offer a substantial range of
insurance services and even own a UK bank as is already the case with
the Alliance &amp; Leicester which has the Girobank as a subsidiary as well
as offering unsecured loans, at least 75% of assets must be in the form
of residential housing.
However, members will have to give their approval if the society does
decide to embark upon new businesses through acquisition.
One particular action will be widely welcomed. That is to do away with
the distinction between society shareholders who have votes and
depositors whose investment with the society is frequently larger who
have none.
This has continued because many depositors are not aware of the legal
differences, possibly being more influenced by interest rates paid, and
their lack of power when it comes to matters such as the election of
directors.
It is now envisaged that all retail investors will become shareholders
although the society will still be able to accept both UK and overseas
wholesale deposits without granting membership.
Contradicting the court judgment which so upset many of the Cheltenham
&amp; Gloucester borrowers, it is proposed that mortgagors will have roughly
the same rights as shareholders in the society. The Government takes the
view that they have as much interest in a society's affairs as
shareholders and frequently the relationship is of a much more durable
nature.
But in the case of mergers and other significant corporate activity,
the two classes will be treated separately as they have different
interests when it comes to voting.
The thorny question of dissidents seeking to be elected to the board
has come down squarely on the side of the aspirants. Henceforth only 10
rather than 50 backers will be required while the election address will
be extended from 200 to 500 words. Also in an attempt to do away with
''jobs for the boys'', the specific merits of a retiring director will
be circulated and what qualities will be required in the replacement.
The summary financial statement which is sent to all members will
become much more user-friendly and give more information. That should
encourage greater loyalty to the organisation and willingness to buy the
extended range of services that will be offered.
Reaction in the bank sector was muted as the proposals contained no
major surprises and that an increase in competition from the societies
is inevitable.

THE Old Firm pulled off a financial double act yesterday by
simultaneously unveiling new plans to boost their respective bank
balances.
Celtic's new shareholders, meeting in Glasgow, approved a
supplementary share issue which will bring in around #4.2m. It will be
open to the thousands of supporters who were not allocated shares last
month, when the club went public, because the issue was oversubscribed.
Celtic's managing director Fergus McCann said the extra money raised
would be used to ''strengthen the football team and progress with work
on the stadium.''
Across the city at Ibrox Stadium Rangers were taking the wraps off the
club's new credit card which, it is estimated, will bring in
#100,000-plus in the first year.
Supporters who sign up for the Rangers Mastercard -- an affinity card
being offered in partnership with the Royal Bank -- will receive reduced
interest rates, no fee for a year and other benefits.
Rangers chairman David Murray said: ''The card alone is highly
attractive, but I am sure many users will also appreciate the potential
income that can be generated by its use -- money which will go directly
into strengthening the team and improving the facilities at Ibrox.''
More than #9.4m was raised last month when Celtic the club went public
but the share issue was hugely oversubscribed. Yesterday at an
extraordinary general meeting the first action of the new shareholders
was to approve a supplementary share issue which will bring in fans who
missed out.
Mr McCann said: ''The shareholders decision will ensure that everyone
who correctly applied for Celtic shares the first time around will
receive the shares and benefits.''
At Ibrox the rewards of the new venture are more modest but will still
bring in a substantial amount of money.
Rangers hope 20,000 fans will trade in their existing credit cards for
the new MasterCard. The club will receive #5 for every person who signs
up for the new card.

IHAVE always been fascinated by UFOs. I know that there have recently
been letters in this very paper discussing this phenomenon, and I've
been watching some of the recent rash of TV programmes, each telling us
what we already know: ie that we don't know very much.
UFOs are an issue which, like circular tea bags, could affect us all,
and we should be thinking seriously about them. After 10 seconds we can,
if we've got any sense, dismiss the whole thing as nonsense, but at
least we'll have made the effort. To the serious person, there are
several questions that should be addressed.
First, are there other planets in our Universe capable of sustaining
life? The other planets in our solar system would be extremely
inhospitable to human beings; they have no discernible atmosphere and
show no obvious signs of life. Granted, this didn't stop people moving
to Cumbernauld, but it seems certain there are less appealing places
than Cumbernauld. Honest!
When considering the existence of alien life-forms, I always like to
bring up the ''monkeys with typewriters'' concept. This says that if you
sit an infinite number of monkeys in front of an infinite number of
typewriters for an infinite length of time, then you'll have your car
bombed by the Animal Liberation Front.
If, however, you give the monkeys full expenses and two photographers,
then after leaving them alone for 10 minutes, you'll probably get a
full-colour sports section suitable for a leading tabloid. Basically,
what I'm trying to say is that the Universe is so vast that some planet
somewhere will possess the potential for sustaining life. Physiologists
have identified these minimum requirements as oxygen, water, alcohol, a
video rental shop, and an organised football league.
So, assuming that they could be bothered, is it possible that aliens
could visit Earth? Even if a ship could move at the speed of light, it
would still take hundreds of years to reach our nearest star. Einstein
said it was impossible to travel faster than light, but how could he be
so certain?
Less than 20 years ago, people worried that they would always have to
wind the car window down with a handle. We're now so advanced that most
families can't put the window up ever since Matthew vomited on the
button. That's progress! So it might take a long while to get here, but
a year might pass quickly in a spaceship. It has been shown that, for
the body concerned, the speed with which time passes changes along with
its velocity. This effect can be simulated. Take one of two twins, and
leave her in her room doing her homework. Let the other twin phone her
boyfriend at your expense. After an hour, one will claim that about four
weeks have passed, while the other will swear that she's only been on
five minutes, and it's cheap rate anyway, right?
What can we surmise about any aliens visiting our solar system?
Bearing in mind that most of the recent Scottish UFO sightings have
occurred in Bonnybridge, you'd have to question how smart they actually
were. I've nothing against Bonnybridge, but if I'd travelled for
centuries to get to Earth, the last place I would head for is the
cultural desert of Central Region. Still, we know that aliens can't be
that stupid, as the UFO detection rate at Euro Disney is still very low.
Even an alien would see that the French are the last people in the world
to aspire to the Disney way of life. It would be like opening up a theme
park in Belgium called ''Interesting-world'', or an Italian one called
''Stable-Government Land''. The French Jimminy Cricket would just sing:
''If you are in trouble, and you don't know what to do, just geeve a
leettle 'Heeeugh'.'' (Cue prolonged shrug of both shoulders.)
And will these interplanetary trippers be earnest scientists, or just
teenage aliens with a loan of Dad's GTi for the week? The scientists
would only visit the more advanced centres of civilisation, while
alien-teens would spend their time hanging around off-licences waiting
for Zorg to buy a dozen cans of cider (he's the one with the moustache).
If we found life on another planet, the first spaceship we would send
would contain David Attenborough, a 10-strong film crew, and a marketing
man from ''What Every Sentient Being Wants''. This could allow us to
make some TV programmes and sell off any remaining stocks of white
towelling socks (only five poun' for three pair!). Maybe the aliens
haven't got our marketing nous, maybe they've just sent lots of alien
families on holiday (Fiuqzh, are we nearly there yet?). It can only be a
matter of time before witnesses report seeing a UPO (Unidentified
Parking Object) complete with a roof rack, in a lay-by. (''Well sir, I
caught the aroma of diluting orange juice, and I'm sure I heard them
play 'I spy . . .' '')
When it comes to anything, Americans just have to go one better. It is
an accepted medical fact that all Americans are deranged. In order to
stand out from the crowd and get invited on to Oprah, the average Yank
realises that they need more than the old ''I saw a flying saucer''
routine. Instead of just seeing a spaceship, many Americans now claim to
have travelled in one. In the States, UFO abductions are increasing
annually, reportedly now involving millions of people! Each ''abductee''
tells of on-board experiences, usually involving the attachment of
numerous probes to their genitals. Now to the MPs among you that might
sound like the perfect night out but if aliens want to learn about human
sexuality they should just read the problem page in Marie Claire like
everyone else.
We still have no hard evidence that these abductions ever occur. In a
women's magazine, one abductee claimed -- and I am not making this up --
that she knew she had been abducted because when she awoke on her couch,
her underwear -- get this -- was on the wrong way round. While believing
that aliens could navigate space's endless void, find Earth, make their
way past our air-defence systems, land a spaceship and abduct her from a
crowded housing estate in Manchester entirely undetected, she honestly
reckons that they couldn't work out how to put a pair of knickers on!
How complex can a pair of kaks be?
Now we know that help is at hand. If you think you're the victim of
repeated alien abductions, help is at hand. Just carefully stretch a
large pair of Y-fronts over each window -- that'll definitely fool them.

THE man was for sure an entrant in an Igor-look-alike contest and his
pal could, with the moon at his back, have been mistaken for Fungus the
Bogyman. They breenged out of the pub doorway and while one honked into
the gutter the other lunged at me. It was not an assault. He was simply
in some need of assistance in staying perpendicular.
Suddenly, I heard the word leak out through clenched teeth: sorry.
This was me apologising. It happens a lot. It seems to me to be, most
often, a woman's condition. Apologetic as we have been taught to be for
troubling you with our mere existence. Mea culpa ingrained like a bad
tattoo on the collective female forehead.
Nobody else seems to say sorry much these days.
Politicians would really rather not. Faced with evidence of flagrant
wrongdoing, caught as it were with their breeks round their ankles, they
prefer the art of parry and scorn and self-justification to the simple
word: sorry.
Those who make a mistake now prefer to deny it. There may be good
reason. It can be dangerous these days to admit to being at fault.
Doctors can no longer afford to admit making a mistake in lopping off
the wrong leg: they might be sued. One oops, sorry slithers out like a
sibilant snake after you bump into a lamp-post, and you lose your
no-claims bonus.
Perhaps, then, we can no longer afford to admit to making mistakes.
The cost is too high. So it-wisna-me-miss is elevated from an immature
attempt at avoiding blame to a cultural credo. No-one is ever personally
at fault any more.
A Sunday newspaper implies Michael Foot was a spy who took money from
the KGB. The editor admits he doesn't believe he was. Does he say sorry
for the distress caused to a man who spent his entire career honourably
opposing Soviet tyranny? Not quite. In case we thought this was a tawdry
and sensationalist puff for the ravings of a money-grubbing double-agent
who made a career out of lying, the editor justifies the smear by saying
''No, we don't believe it either but the KGB did''.
In industry, aged men who should be pushing lawnmowers into a sunlit
retirement see no need to apologise for grabbing obscene amounts of dosh
for part-time jobs.
There is of course the Holy Willie syndrome which uses the word sorry
as a weapon with which to smack victims over the skull without actually
believing they have anything to apologise for; the politicians' doleful
headshaking over another two million jobs lost; the toothsucking hacks
whose mock shock horror over the latest royal wrongdoing does not
preclude giving us blow by blow accounts of toe-curling phonecalls; the
Prince of Wales admitting he was a serially monogamous adulterer while
pinning the blame on an unhappy relationship with his dad.
Paradoxically, when something awful goes wrong in our society we cast
around for someone, anyone, on whom to cast the blame. The unseemly hunt
for scapegoats, like single mothers, disturbed children, the public
sector borrowing requirement, seems to me a ploy to avoid
self-examination. Or any acceptance of a share of responsibility.
Then there is the BBC Director-General. Poor Mr Birt, who had a weekly
lesson in penitence inculcated in him by the Christian Brothers in
Liverpool, where pupils learned in a climate of fear, where shortcomings
were rewarded with a stroke of the infamous strap, scolds his employees
for seeking to expose mistakes.
Funny, I thought, that those who hold the BBC by the throat, the
people who one suspects never had to unlearn the impulse to say sorry,
feel they are entitled to creeping sycophancy by those who try to expose
strategies of deceit, who want a straight answer to a direct question:
was this a mistake? A simple sorry would do. It would save so much
effort in working out lame excuses which we don't believe anyway.
Now, at last, we have someone berating himself for his failure,
apologising for letting down the public, his family, his friends,
himself. And who is it? Why, it's poor, tormented Stephen Fry, a man who
has elevated concealment by exposure to a sore personal artform.
The coruscating reviews got to him and he did a flit for which he has
said sorry in letters to friends, family, agent, and playwright. He may
be wrong to care so much. He might be right to apologise for causing so
much concern.
To admit a mistake and say sorry is a sign of strength. In his case
mea culpa might be mannerly but unnecessary. He needn't take all the
blame. Nobody else does.

Christopher Whatley argues that nationalists and unionists should
beware of taking up inflexible positions on a Scottish historical
landscape that is always being reshaped by modern scholars.
SCOTTISH History Matters, according to the title of a recent Saltire
Society publication. It does. At all levels of debate about Scotland's
identity, and its constitutional future, appeals both directly and by
inference are made to the past. As a ''stateless nation'' since 1707, it
matters that we really know what Scotland was, is, and might be. In
Scotland, then, the historian has an important and responsible part to
play.
Scots, firm in their (now challenged) belief in the universality of
Scottish education and historically higher-than-average literacy levels,
must be one of the least historically literate nations in Europe.
Despite recent improvements in the five-14 curriculum, primary-school
exposure to Scottish history for many of today's adult Scots was
restricted to Bannockburn and Mary, Queen of Scots -- taught as a
romantic fragment in isolation from a much more substantial past. At
''H'' grade, the Russian Revolution and Appeasement have more takers
(and providers) than Scottish topics.
It is right that pupils in Scottish schools should look beyond their
native heath, but shameful that most school-leavers have never had more
than a cursory look at their own country's history, or the opportunity
to place and comprehend their own society on the wider stage of world
history. For the great majority of Scots, many of whom are anxious to
make good the St Andrew's House shortfall, the map of Scotland's past is
necessarily a patchy one, an amalgam of assumption, myth, ''facts'', and
fact.
Yet ideas about Scotland's history gleaned at random from sources
which range from selected readings from Robert Burns, through John
Prebble to (at the upper end of the popular market) T C Smout's seminal
History of the Scottish People, will differ from that as seen by
professional Scottish historians today. From the 1970s, the study of
Scottish history in the universities has flourished, and despite
spending cuts and gaps in some areas of study, is still hugely
productive, while at most of the older universities the subject is being
taught to healthy numbers of students by a small but committed army of
teachers who are placing Scotland's history firmly within its British,
European, and world context. Long-held beliefs have been subject to
scholarly scrutiny and revision. The historical landscape is being
reshaped. This is quite proper, is no criticism of ''older'' histories
as such, and indeed provides eloquent testimony to the current health
and vibrancy of Scottish historical studies.
It is to be regretted, however, that while there are some honourable
exceptions, Scottish historians -- like scholars in other disciplines --
have not always placed sufficient emphasis on communicating their
findings to a wider audience. There are many reasons for this: one is
the unworldliness of some academics; although less true nowadays,
another has been the lack of interest of some publishers in topics which
fall outside their prescribed range of what is saleable in Scottish
history; the electronic media (television in particular) appears -- like
the film industry -- to prefer to paint topics in black and white
(against a backcloth of heather and hills) rather than in honest (and
much more subtle) shades of grey.
Another is the current research assessment exercise, a form of quality
control in higher education which links funding to peer review -- and
therefore encourages publication in inaccessible scholarly journals
rather than for the public, the taxpayers who fund academic salaries,
yet who reap less of a direct reward than they deserve. In these
circumstances those who have a voice which extends beyond the specialist
confines of the seminar room have a particular responsibility to report
fully and fairly the more significant work being carried out.
Albeit indirectly, it is the wider community which in part at least
sets the agenda for Scottish historians. Thus it is scarcely surprising
that the topic which has generated greater heat in scholarly circles
than any other is the Union of 1707. There is a clear correlation
between upsurges of political enthusiasm for a change in Scotland's
constitutional status and the intensity of the academic debate. The
later 1970s were one such period; another is now.
The subject has seen momentous shifts in scholarly opinion over the
past three decades. Detailed studies of the previously impenetrable
world of Scottish -- and English -- politics have been undertaken. The
voting patterns of the members of the Scottish Estates have been subject
to computer-aided analysis; which has uncovered somewhat more principled
behaviour on all sides than has generally been supposed. On the other
hand, the idea that there was forward-looking statesmanship on the part
of Scotland's political leaders has been dismissed, and the role of
party stressed.
At the other extreme is a minor school of thought which has emphasised
the role of bribery. Doubts have been expressed about the extent to
which Union was a ''bargain'', in which political independence was
surrendered for free trade. How far and in what ways Scotland benefited
from closer union with England are matters of intense debate. The older
idea that Scottish trade only blossomed after 1707 has been discarded;
much more emphasis has been placed on pre-Union economic achievement,
and the extent to which the Scots made the Union work for them.
Guarantees were for the short-term and applied to specific individuals
and interest groups: in the longer run everything had to be fought for.
Historians know a lot more than they ever did: disagreement continues,
however, and no particular school of thought can declare an overwhelming
victory.
It is important that these changing perceptions are communicated
outside the universities, and it is partly for this reason that the
Economic and Social History Society of Scotland recently published its
Bought and Sold for English Gold? That this was so was not made apparent
in Paul Scott's recent review of the pamphlet (The Herald, January 21,
1995), which, he declared, had ''more to do with propaganda than
scholarship''. This seems strange, given the objective declared in the
pamphlet's subtitle, Explaining the Union of 1707. It sought, not as
Scott alleges ''to make the Union respectable'', but to clarify the
issues and provide an explanation for the Union which draws upon the
recent work of a range of historians. None would consider themselves to
be pro-Union apologists, consciously or otherwise.
In its present buoyant condition, however, Scottish history is no
place for the propagandist. It is, of course, understandable why
nationalist writers have supported the proposition that the Union was
the result of the twin forces of English aggression and Scottish
venality, or better, the venality of an unrepresentative few. No-one
would deny that bribery, in various guises, played its part in achieving
the Union. (The big -- and unresolved -- question is how many minds were
changed by such means, which were in fact an integral part of the
political mechanism of the day.)
Yet such an appeal can actually undermine the Scottish cause: it fuels
that strand within Scottish national identity which is rooted in noble
defeat -- Flodden, Culloden and Charles Edward Stuart -- and in the case
of 1707 absolves Scots of the responsibility for the actions of what was
a far from quiescent Parliament. It is true that the Union proposals
were hugely unpopular outside the Scottish Parliament, but there are
suggestions in the surviving evidence that participation and pressure on
the part of the ''mob'' and specific interest groups did lead to
amendments being made to the Articles of Union which quietened
opposition and gave a greater (but admittedly slight) legitimacy to the
Act than is sometimes assumed.
On the other hand, to suggest that the Union lacks legitimacy because
there was no eighteenth-century equivalent of a referendum is
anachronistic: rulers of early modern European states did not consult
their people.
Modern nationalists who seek succour for their political views in
history might be better rewarded if they were to consider the argument
that the Union was a short-term solution to a pressing political problem
on both sides of the Border. There is no shame in conceding that perhaps
the arrangements made in the final months of 1706 were appropriate for
the time -- the best option for Scotland in the circumstances, an
example of realpolitik.
It was a settlement for its time. It happened to work in the interests
of most Scots for the best part of two centuries. It worked because
Scots politicians, merchants, bankers, industrialists, coal miners,
engineers, female jute workers, and others, made it work by exploiting
the opportunities it offered. This approach provides powerful evidence
of the ability of Scots to succeed in a competitive and hostile trading
environment, something which modern nationalists have to persuade an
electorate educated on a toxic diet of Scottish inadequacy.
The truth is that neither nationalist nor unionist appeals to history
for unambiguous support for their cause will find it. Among responsible
historians the causes and consequences of 1707 are still genuinely
debated. Lessons from history, which necessarily shift over time, can
rarely be satisfactorily incorporated into the cut and thrust of
party-political debate. In its present state of energetic flux Scottish
history is an uncertain ally. A new view of Scotland's past is being
generated, which is providing rich ground for thought and a stronger
sense of national worth, but not a blueprint for political action.

THE life of Sir Ian McKellen is a major British drama in two acts, the
first of which took rather a long time to reach the interval. He was in
his fiftieth year before he announced the fact of his homosexuality to a
Radio Three audience.
He was prompted, it seems, not by the spontaneity of the broadcasting
moment, but growing rage at a political climate he saw as increasingly
repressive. In particular at Clause 28, the now notorious clause in the
Local Government Act, which prohibited the funding of gay or lesbian
initiatives, however socially responsible.
For those local councils already homophobic it provided a legislative
fig-leaf to cloak their prejudice; elsewhere it tied the purse-strings
of more sympathetic officials.
But for Ian McKellen, not yet knight of this realm, it provided the
impetus to tell the world that which had never been a secret within the
theatre-world, and, in so doing, gave gays and lesbians in Britain one
of their most powerful and respected voices.
Six years later, his prodigious energies are now split between theatre
work and his role as political lobbyist, fundraiser, and proselytiser.
Tomorrow night at the Citizens' these roles merge, as he brings his
one-man show, A Knight Out, to Glasgow to help raise funds for the
second Glasgay! arts festival which returns in October.
In structure, it is not unlike the much lauded Acting Shakespeare, his
other solo show, but so autobiographical is the material within this
performance that it is inconceivable that it could have been either
written or performed by a gay actor still partially seeking the
anonymity of the closet.
''I wrote it first to perform in New York because they wanted a
cultural festival alongside the 4th Gay Games there, and so it has bits
of material in it like my Salieri from Amadeus, which wasn't seen in
Britain. But much of it is very personal; about how it was growing-up in
Wigan and Bolton as a boy and then a young man, knowing you were gay,
but thinking that was private and disregarding that part of your life.
''There was absolutely nothing to help . . . no help at school, no
help at home, no help at church and those were the three main areas of
my life. And, I think, I probably escaped into the world of the theatre
where it was enclosed, where I could find a substitute family and where
it was relatively easy to be openly gay.''
Many of his friends and colleagues still observe that conscious
double-standard of an openness about their sexual orientation within
their acting lives which is never replicated in public, and certainly
not in the public prints.
McKellen acknowledges that many more people, using the fact of their
celebrity to lobby for the causes he cares for, would not only be
effective ''but frankly cut down on the workload I have. But I can't be
critical of their choices. After all, I was the same for 49 years. I can
and do talk to them about it, and tell them how much happier and freer
coming-out would make them.
''And so you get people like Nigel Hawthorne, in his sixties, up for
an Oscar, his career blossoming, deciding to say that, yes he's gay, and
he lives with a partner whom he declines to name, and with Nigel that
may be the end of it. Tony Sher is something the same.''
IT was with Sher that he travelled recently to South Africa, a country
where coming-out would have been unthinkable prior to that country's
political sea-change, but where paradoxically, says McKellen, people
were so obsessed with the race and apartheid issues that homosexuality
was less likely to be a preoccupation with right-wing legislators.
''And now, of course, we have the depressing -- and exciting --
situation where the world's newest democracy has equality laws,
enshrined in its interim constitution, which outlaw discrimination on
some 14 different grounds, including race and gender, religion and
sexual orientation, while we are still doing battle with the world's
oldest democracy.''
His prognosis is that the current UK administration is unlikely to
shift either on discriminatory clauses or on the equalisation of the age
of consent, not least because Governments with small, and shrinking,
majorities are not given to unnecessary further rocking of leaky
electoral boats. Though in that, says McKellen, they misread the public
mood, which, he suggests, is discernibly more liberal.
''The noises being made by Tony Blair's party suggest they will have a
different attitude, but we wait to see whether these noises translate
into manifesto commitments, and in the meantime it is the job of people
like Stonewall to lobby them and make sure they do.''
Stonewall, now four years old, was set up as the lobbyist arm of the
gay rights movement in Britain, and it consumes much of McKellen's time.
Through sustained campaigning activity, his acting career could have
been swamped, and, in truth, he has not appeared on stage in a company
context for three years now. But he is rather puzzled to find he doesn't
appear to be missing it.
''Of course I've been fiddling about in films for that time, and even
just now I'm still waiting for that call which will tell me that we can,
at last, begin to film Richard III. But it will be interesting to see
how I react when I do get back into a play again. I have to say though
that doing the solo show is a terrifically satisfying experience.
''The theatre is so different from films and television, in that,
although you are playing to a houseful of strangers, it is a house and
the people who come to it may share the pleasure together in a way which
isn't possible in a cinema. Being the master of ceremonies at that kind
of happening is very nice indeed.''
Being the master of ceremonies at the Citz' tomorrow night is a choice
he made himself. Called up by the organisers of Glasgay! to ask for some
advice on fundraising for this year's festival, he promptly offered his
show. Administrator Cordelia Ditton says she was so ''gobsmacked'' she
forgot to say yes. But phoned back pronto to do so, lest he change his
mind.
McKellen says: ''When I do the show I like to stand at the door at the
end like the vicar and some of the feeback I get is very touching. Not
just from people who haven't felt able to be honest about their
homosexuality, but from obviously married couples who come up and tell
me they hadn't realised how difficult it could be to be gay in Britain.
''I come from a long line of teachers, preachers and missionaries.
Maybe this sort of bearing witness that I do in A Knight Out, this
sharing of personal experience, is my belated contribution to that
line.''
* A Knight Out is at the Citizens' Theatre in Glasgow tomorrow night
only at 7.45pm. Tickets are #8 and #5 with the usual concessions from
the Citizens' box-office and Ticketlink Centres. Glasgay! 1995, will run
from October 27 to November 5.

DEMI Moore is flavour of the month in films based on best-selling
books. She stars as the corporate predator in the film adaptation of
Michael Crichton's Disclosure in which admitted real-life sex addict
Michael Douglas is, for once, an unwilling seduction target.
She has also ruffled Hollywood's feminist fringe by accepting $8m
dollars to bear all in Striptease.
The actress, aka Mrs Bruce Willis, plays stripper Erin Grant in, what
we can only expect to be, a somewhat toned-down version of Miami-based
author Carl Hiaasen's naughty and hilarious novel. The former, and
reformed, Brat Pack hellraiser is at present in Georgia producing and
appearing in a cameo role in The Gaslight Addition, which stars Melanie
Griffiths, and is a girls' version of Stand By Me.
Moore maintains that, like Clint Eastwood, you do a movie for the
moneymen in suits and, if the profits are good, you can indulge in your
own projects. Disclosure was one of last year's hottest properties in
America. Even non-fans can't wait for Striptease. There's going to be
much more seen of Moore.
Following Indecent Proposal and A Few Good Men, and with her husband
back in favour with the critics for Pulp Fiction (and soon to be seen in
the third instalment of his Die-Hard mayhem movies) the couple are
getting the best tables in town. At present, that is.
Also back in favour is John Travolta, who co-starred with Bruce Willis
in Pulp Fiction. Last year he would have been happy with any job. This
week the Best Actor Oscar nominee has put his price at $9m a movie.
Which would certainly help
finance a nursery for the baby sister he, and his actress wife Kelly
Preston, are planning.
Despite some reports, Dr Who appears to be alive in Hollywood. Steven
Spielberg plans to revive the series, and still in place are Monty
Python's Eric Idle as the Doctor, and Pamela
''Baywatch'' Anderson as his co-star (adding a new dimension to the
project, but not playing a dalek).
More deja vu: Sidney Poiter, who appeared with Lulu in the 1967 film
To Sir, With Love, has agreed to reprise that role. This time he'll be a
1990s teacher and will need all the love he can get in the modern-day
blackboard jungle.
Reclusive author Thomas Harris is staying silent about the publication
date of his next novel. His millions of fans can't wait for the return
of Dr Hannibal Lecter, brought off the printed page by Anthony Hopkins
in Silence of the Lambs. Harris, a former wire service reporter, has
never given an interview to promote his novels. His publisher in New
York told me this week: ''When we get his manuscript we'll set a
publication date.'' The new book is titled The Morbidity of the Soul and
has Lecter vying with another serial killer.
I'm privately told Harris will deliver by Easter. Brando, according to
Warner Brothers' sources, is said to be interested in eating up the
Lecter role.
A long-lost highlight of Richard Burton's life -- a 1964 film made of
his performance as Hamlet on Broadway -- has been discovered. Burton,
directed by Sir John Gielgud, mesmerised audiences all those years ago.
It will be seen at the National Theatre in a few weeks and then will go
into selected cinemas throughout the country.
The movie to wait for is Fred Schepsi's I.Q. which establishes Meg
Ryan as a Carole Lombard style, comedy actress. With Walter Matthau as
her uncle Albert, Einstein that is, and our own Stephen Fry as her
intended husband, the film won't tax your brain but it's a lot of fun.
Jodie Foster has finally turned down the lead role as Jean Seberg in a
bio-pic of the actress. Foster has the star part in Otto Preminger's St
Joan. Winona Ryder, who is soon to be seen as Jo March in Little Women,
will now take on the tragic role. Seberg was the victim of a hate
campaign allegedly orchestrated by FBI director J Edgar Hoover, who
abhorred her free-living style and liberal politics. She was driven to
suicide.

NO doubt about the radio event of this week, in terms of ambition and
achievement; it was last Saturday's huge four-hour adaptation of Len
Deighton's Bomber, the tale of a tragically mis-targeted British bombing
raid over Germany on Saturday, February 18, 1943, broadcast in four
''real time'' sequences between 2.30 in the afternoon and midnight, when
the last surviving British bomber limped back to base at RAF Warley Fen.
Deighton's story is complex enough in itself, attempting as it does to
describe the raid from within the minds, not only of a huge range of
British service personnel involved -- from doomed pilots to Bomber
Command top-brass -- but also from the point of view of the citizens of
the little German town of Altgarten, who become the unintended victims
of one of the most horrific bombing raids of the Second World War.
But for the purposes of this massive radio drama -- timed to coincide
with the fiftieth anniversary of the bombing of Dresden -- Joe Dunlop,
who adapted the text, and director Adrian Bean, went on to add a further
layer of meaning to the story. They interspersed the drama with the
real-life recollections of men and women who flew the planes, manned the
airfields, or struggled to survive the impact of the bombs in the
streets and fields of Germany.
And, it has to be said, that the cumulative effect of this great
documentary drama was quite stunning, not to say disturbing and in some
ways unexpected. For this detailed and uncompromising account of the
havoc wrought by a single, a single, bombing raid -- contained less
comfort for those, including myself, who tend to see the Second World
War as a war that ''made sense'', or left us in Britain morally
unscathed, than any account of that conflict I have ever experienced.
Of course, nothing in this drama changed the fact that Hitler had to
be stopped, and that this was perhaps the only way of doing it. But the
unrelenting, nightmare quality of the broadcast -- reinforced by a dark
performance from Tom Baker as the Narrator, which absolutely refused the
solid, comfortable, all-right-in-the-end manner common to British war
memoirs -- made it clear that, even where the hell of total war is
necessary, nothing under heaven can make it ''all right''. It also and
conjured up deep and uncomfortable thoughts about the tangle of infernal
memories, of horrific dreams and terrible sights seen, that must have
lain just beneath the surface of the cosy post-war Britain in which I
grew up, and are perhaps not fully exorcised yet.
Which makes it all the more surprising and encouraging that this
complex and troubling piece of work apparently scored a massive hit with
Radio 4's supposedly conservative audience; according to Chris Dunkley
of the Feedback programme, it attracted the largest, positive postbag
ever received in the Feedback office for a single programme. And that,
in turn, makes me wonder why the BBC -- in its new audience-responsive
mode -- so often falls into the trap of simply providing what audiences
are supposed to want, instead of experimenting with original ideas which
they might love, given half a chance.
ON Monday afternoon, for instance, Radio 4 was to be heard
broadcasting, as part of its lightweight ''Romance Season'', a piece of
Mills and Boon tripe so grotesquely dreadful, in every respect, that it
was difficult to imagine how the director, Shaun McLoughlin, or a cast
headed by serious actors, like Jack Klaff and Carolyn Backhouse, had
actually got through the recording without calling the whole project off
in disgust. The story was called Another Life, and featured a series of
preposterous misunderstandings between a rising ballet star, called Sara
Demaine, and the love of her life, a saturnine, handsome and
ill-tempered doctor (name of Clive) who is given to snapping her
bikini-straps and forcing his hard, muscular body upon hers at the drop
of a hat.
If it had just been the paper-thin characterisation and the vile
quality of the dialogue, the thing would just have been bad and
disappointing. But the fact is that it was shot through with a streak of
vicious sado-masochism -- near-rape as the ultimate proof of passion --
and gloating, sexual voyeurism that reeked of nothing so much as
poor-quality pornography.
I was flatly shocked that such a piece of cheap nastiness should be
broadcast on BBC radio at all; and if this is Radio 4's idea of catering
to popular taste, I hope the audience response will send the network
straight back to the drawing-board, with a large flea in its ear.

A LARGE and vociferous audience welcomed Suzanne Bonnar on to the
stage. Her television exposure may well have been traumatic for her but
it certainly seems to have got people on her side.
Some might say it earned her the sympathy vote. Maybe it's just me but
I like singers to sing the melody. Six songs into her set I still hadn't
heard a melody I recognised, although standards such as Them Their Eyes
and Body and Soul were included.
She has a way of running at a tune and scrunching up the phrasing so
it spills over the barlines. Depending on your viewpoint, Don't Get
Around Much Any More was either a brave new way of handling an old
warhorse or a mess. I'm going with the latter.
There can be no complaints with her choice of musicians, however.
Brian Kellock (piano), Phil Bancroft (tenor saxophone), Kenny Ellis
(double bass), and Mike Bradley (drums) gave her the ideal platform on
which to show her talents but there's a lot of work to be done before
the hoo-hah surrounding Bonnar can begin to be justified.
Sharing the bill (calling him a support act would be the ultimate
injustice), David Newton provided an exemplary example of the solo
pianist's art.
His opening selection of mostly his own compositions had a great
variety of rhythms, imaginative changes of pace, and some of the most
concise improvisations you will hear anywhere.
The way he marshals his ideas really is something special and his
playing on Martin Taylor's exuberant, Spanish-flavoured Fraternity,
which closed that first selection, complete with flamenco-style
footwork, was only exceeded in quality by the marvellously inventive
version of Sonny Rollins's Caribbean folk song, St Thomas, which served
as a finale.

REMARKABLE what you can do with a few planks of wood in the David
Glass Ensemble's adaptation of Paul Theroux's The Mosquito Coast. They
become everything from an asparagus plantation to a riverboat, a
building site to a crucifix.
Like the central character, Allie Fox, played with sturdy charisma by
Tom Hodgkins in his best John Wayne accent, the set has the capacity to
conjure up visual magic before our eyes. The Mosquito Coast might be a
novel that dramatist John Constable says ''nobody in their right mind
would dream of adapting'', but this is a special type of story-telling
theatre that revels in putting across complex narratives in the simplest
way possible. And very effective it is too.
Rae Smith's set is an elemental mix of earth, wood and water; and
flames, fire, and smoke make regular appearances. For all the apparent
simplicity, however, this is a technically elaborate production which
succeeds because it does not call attention to itself, opting instead to
beguile us with the strength of the story.
So we get a tale of a New England farmhand who is so disillusioned by
the American way of life that he and his family up sticks (and we see
the sticks) and sail to the Honduran jungle on a mission to create
''perfection in an imperfect world''. On stage such a tale of
overweening pride takes on the form of a classical tragedy, Tom Hodgkins
taking us from the heights of passionate obsession to the depths of
psychological disorder.
Helped by a tremendous percussive score composed and performed by
Derek Houghton, it is a production that is gripping, disturbing, and
ultimately moving.

SELDOM can a concerto have been written that is as immediate, direct,
and straight to the point as The Celtic, written for the BT Scottish
Ensemble by its resident composer, Dave Heath. The concerto, a display
piece for ensemble leader Clio Gould, has been receiving its first raft
of performances throughout the week. Last night it reached Glasgow and
an enthusiastic reception.
After a haunting opening, the music plunges straight into a kind of
reel for the soloist which alternates with orchestral music that zings
with the snappy punch of Bartok. At the other end of the piece a driving
folk tune sails over a galloping accompaniment. All the way there are
tons of display opportunities for soloist and ensemble, dispatched last
night with zest and elan.
The entire evening was a showcase for the ensemble -- prodigious
harpsichord virtuosity from Leslie MacLeod in Bach's Fifth Brandenburg
Concerto (which also featured Dave Heath on flute), consummate and
laid-back musicianship from William Conway in a sunny account of
Boccherini's Cello Concerto, and some meaty, grinding playing from the
entire outfit in Bartok's Divertimento -- a big performance of a big
piece; packed with incident, wit, and drive.

Tokyo, Friday
IRISH president Mary Robinson today urged the British and Irish
Governments to pay attention to fears voiced by Northern Ireland's
Unionists over the peace plan for the province.
''It is true that there has been criticism and sharp reaction to the
framework document,'' she told a Tokyo news conference.
''What is important now is that there be an ability to listen to the
fears, to take seriously the sense of apprehension of the Unionists'
fear that they may lose their identity.''
On Wednesday, Britain and Ireland announced the framework document to
forge new relations between Ulster and Eire.
The Unionists angrily voiced their disapproval of the document, which
they see as a sell-out by the UK Government. They have begun two days of
talks on how to react to the plans.
Mrs Robinson said today: ''The important thing now is the question of
political discussion and not political violence. This is a time of
singular hope and opportunity for the people of the island of Ireland
with the achievement of peace.''

MY morning with designer Jasper Conran starred food and children. He
gets most excited and most upset about both. He was late. Black cabs
came and went, depositing the rotund (staff) and the featherweight
(dancers) at the door of Scottish Ballet's HQ in Glasgow.
An hour later, the man the British press dubbed ''superbrat'' finally
emerged from a taxi. I pressed my nose against the third-floor tenement
window in anticipation.
Jasper Conran was wearing a tracksuit top, and jeans ripped at the
bum. But what was most telling was the look of startled incomprehension
on the face of the taxi driver as Conran offered him a crumpled tenner
for the ride; the ignorant gape the professionally cynical give someone
unmaimed by disappointment. A sort of: ''Haven't you learnt your lesson
yet?'' Either that, or the driver hadn't realised that his passenger was
gay.
Jasper Conran is not a big guy. But he has a huge voice, aurally and
internationally speaking. His clients include Princess Di. He's won
awards. He is a successful, self-made businessman who has the respect of
the fashion industry, which, incidentally, he isn't particularly
impressed with. (''I work in it, but I don't have to love it''.)
He apologises for the delay, and accepts the last of a packet of
extra-strong mints (which he later takes out of his mouth, after a good
sook, and delicately places in an ashtray in order to drink his filter
coffee).
He asks if he can take a look at my computer print-out, a compilation
of any article ever written on him. He unfolds each page, as if drawing
up rope from a dark and mucky well, with murmurs of ''unbelievable''. He
displays a mixture of self-effacement, scorn, and genuine dismay. The
man is merely tolerant of publicity. How tolerant is he going to be of
the interview?
I explain I'm not a fashion critic, that he'll be ''human interest''.
''I'm proud to be human interest'' he purrs, turning blue eyes on
full-beam towards me, ''it's much more interesting.''
This is the big deal. Jasper Conran is hard and relatively
unforgiving: ''I would give somebody a dressing down if I thought they
were being unprofessional. I'll say what I have to say, and then I'll be
nice to them,'' he says. ''It's all about sloppiness of mind; sloppy
minds will produce sloppy work and that's no good for anybody.''
Contending for the role of the Jeremy Beadle of clothes-design, he
adds: ''Standards are there to be attained, and if they're not, when I'm
about, watch out.''
He is, however, alarmingly concerned with making people happy. This is
the remit of his clothes and his personality. (''I make clothes in which
women feel good''.) He is very protective, very much an angry mother
hen.
''I think the fashion industry does need to be careful. It is a
commercial venture which has great influence on how women feel about
themselves and it has a responsibility not to abuse that power. I design
for a woman, not some anorexic teenager.''
Conran was teased for being a fat boy at school. His hurt developed a
strong, social conscience. He empathises with anyone who is
discriminated because of how they look; ethnic groups, the old and the
handicapped. But his point of reference is death. He knows that it's a
snuff of an existence. Conran knows what he wants. Of course he works,
seven days a week in fact. But only because it suits him. He's no
martyr. It's what he won't do which has shaped his career.
''I think you have to stand up and be counted. You can't let the
buggers get you down. You cannot have your character moulded by what
people are going to say. It's not only dishonest, it makes you into a
really unpleasant piece of work.''
He has a strict criteria in both his public and professional world;
dispensing with fluff and frill as if streamlining a dress. (''I need
one car, one garden, one house, one dog.'') But his affinity is with the
past.
''The Elizabethan era and the eighteenth century are my two favourite
periods in British history, visually. As a whole, the Elizabethan period
is the most interesting. It was the woman. God, I think she was
incredible, a bitch, but incredible. She was a superb politician and she
sacrificed herself on the altar for the job that she was doing. She was
a woman living in a man's world. But she was never done over by the
man.''
Jasper Conran does not have any male heroes -- his love is of such as
Elizabeth Tudor. I relate to his love of ruthlessness. I'm not saying he
is, but I wonder if he wishes he were.
''They were all plotting and scheming like mad, you never knew when
your cup was going to be poisoned, you never knew when someone was going
to blow you up, stab you in the back. The Queen was an original
character, original in her approach and spirit. She wore gorgeous
dresses, of course, but they were considered to be common at the time.
She also swore like a trouper. I do like that, when women are really
tough and strong, like Coco Chanel. Brutal.''
It is at this point that our conversation is interrupted by a tirade
of abuse from outside the door. An English male dancer delivers a
90-second outrage on the habits of a hungry ballerina.
''She ate five platefuls of spaghetti bolognese last night,'' he
screeches, ''she's getting as fat as a pig.'' Jasper listens,
fascinated. Now I know where the expression ''pre-Madonna'' comes from.
Perhaps the dancer had to lift her. Grace can only be the result of a
compression of steam.
''Talent is as talent does,'' Conran continues. ''You can see
immensely talented people who won't lift a finger to help themselves.
That is such a despicable waste, laziness. I haven't had a day off for
seven months now. I'm going out for a business dinner tonight, mmmm,
lovely,'' he drops into an impersonation of Kenneth Williams ''with a
film crew looking into my plate of soup. Going oooh what's he eating?'
It's exhausting.''
I ask him what he likes about the series of costumes he has made for
Scottish Ballet's production of Swan Lake. Nothing registers on his
face. ''I'm not really pleased with it but you've got to understand it's
a week before the show and I'm terrified, I don't know whether I've got
it right or wrong. It's the first time I've done a three-act ballet with
set and costumes.''
Jasper is already thinking of having curry for lunch. He stares out
the window into a living-room across the street, where a small child is
visible. He frowns and clouds over.
''What is a child doing in a dark room, on her own, with the curtains
almost closed?'' he begs, hiccuping in a kind of fury. ''Why not let in
some light?'' He turns away and shakes his head.

AND so it was that the critical mass descended like a plague of
locusts upon a London theatre this week and, with a few unkind words,
knocked the stuffing out of that nice man Stephen Fry. The actor,
clearly more thin-skinned than most in his profession, beat a hasty
retreat to a foreign land, there to lick his wounds and ponder his
future.
Actors are a funny lot. A breed apart. Theirs is a life which, by its
very nature, is a life of unreality; of role playing. Stephen Fry's
greatest crime, according to those now infamous notices of Simon Gray's
new West End play, Cell Mates, was of playing, well, of playing Stephen
Fry. This, it seems, was a hanging offence.
Yesterday, to the great relief of his friends and family, he broke his
silence with a faxed message to his agent. He was, he said, a silly old
fool who could only offer ''cowardice, embarrassment, and distress as
excuses for such absurd behaviour''. His departure was not out of pique
or because he had been wounded or hurt. It was because the critics had
been right -- he had let the side down with a poor performance.
There is a school of thought which offers little sympathy to the
actor. After all, no-one put a gun to his head and forced him to take
the ill-fated part. All he had to do, as Noel Coward once remarked, was
learn his lines and avoid bumping into the furniture. But that was not
good enough for Stephen Fry.
Like all actors, he lives almost completely on emotion. He can stand
upon the stage, metaphorically naked in his costume and his greasepaint,
and feel the exhilaration and the thrill of a thousand people clapping
and cheering his performance. But then there is the downside. The actor
can die upon that same stage. His death may be the result of a
self-inflicted wound -- a poor performance or an ill-judged role -- but
it can also be down to a bad play or a duff director and, therefore,
outwith his control.
And always, sitting there in the front row, are the journalistic
vultures. The critics who, in London's West End at least, can make or
break a play; can make or break a Stephen Fry, as it turns out. Actors
desperately need the re-assuring comfort blanket of praise and applause.
They were not forthcoming from the reviewers' pens.
Some critics, maybe most critics, can be cruel in their disregard for
human sensibility. But that's their job. They inhabit a murky little
world, that peculiar borderline between artistic creation and public
consumption. Too many of them have little more than a passing knowledge
of their subject. They know nothing of the skills and techniques
involved. They hide their ignorance behind a mask of journalistic
destruction and take their job description too literally, mistaking
critique for criticism.
Of course, knocking a performance -- whether it be on the stage, on
the television, or in the movies -- is easy. A fool could do it. But
being constructive with your criticism is a kettle of very different
fish -- because that requires experience and a deep and meaningful
knowledge.
In the beginning criticism of the arts was a noble and honourable
profession. It came first in glorious essays by the likes of Ezra Pound,
T S Eliot, and Virginia Woolf before it found its way into newspapers.
In the sixties the critics were regarded as defenders of freedom of
speech and freedom of expression, at a time when those liberties were
perceived to be under threat from authority.
But now criticism has gone too far. To a point where everything, not
just books and plays and music and films, is criticised. Open any
magazine or journal and you'll find a critical comparison of, say,
electric hair-driers or bottled water. Everyone, it seems, has an
opinion.
At the risk of appearing parochial, Mr Fry would have perhaps been
better advised to have his opening night, not in London, but in Glasgow
or Edinburgh. There are several very good reasons for this. The most
important is the fact that Scottish theatregoers are no slaves to the
whim of the critic. Quite the reverse, in fact. They, and only they,
will be the best judge of what they like and what they don't like.
Indeed, they are thrawn enough to go to a play simply because it has
received a bad review.
Glasgow's Citizens' Theatre, not so long ago, carried out some
research into theatrical criticism. The surprising conclusion it came to
was that for the most part reviews, good or bad, had little or no
influence upon a potential audience. It is also the case that, since
Scottish theatres stick to a rigid system of set runs (usually lasting
3[1/2] weeks), it is impossible for a critic to ''close'' a show.
London, of course, is different. There an audience has to be told what
to like. They have neither self-control nor independence of mind. It is
small wonder then that the all-powerful critics are the arbiters of
theatrical fashion in the capital. If they say it is good then it must
be good; bad then it must be bad. They appear mob-handed on a West End
first night, dressed in a uniform of trenchcoat and fedora, like Her
Majesty's Inspectorate of Theatrical Performance. All that's missing is
the clipboard.
Still, it could have been worse. Stephen Fry could have opened in New
York. There they take no prisoners. Until his departure from the post
last year, Frank Rich, the influential and ruthless drama critic of the
New York Times, the self-styled ''Butcher of Broadway'', was the great
bete noire of American theatre. A critical review from him could close a
show before it had barely started. But again, like London, New York
audiences are notoriously dependent upon the opinion of the critic. He
knows what's best for them.
It is a curiously negative profession. What do you do for a living? I
criticise. For the purposes of research into this article, I asked a
distinguished Scottish actor (who wished to remain nameless) for his
critical opinion on critics. He answered with a question. I have never
understood what they do, he said. What is the point and the purpose of
artistic criticism, he asked. He fervently believed that making a
critical judgment was of benefit to no-one. Not to the public and
certainly not to the artists. People, in the end, made up their own
minds.
Stephen Fry's mistake was not the fact that he had overworked himself.
Nor had it anything remotely to do with his performance. No. The only
thing that he did wrong was to let the critics get under his skin. In
the end he broke the golden rule -- he let them grind him down.
* The theatrical critics: the only thing that Stephen Fry did wrong
was to let them get under his skin.

The arguments for and against concealing identities in rape cases
THE police officer cleared of raping a female colleague after a
drunken ''toffs and tarts'' party is furious that his accuser remains
anonymous. He wants a change in the law. Diplomat's son Michael Seear
says the woman who dragged him into court should not be permitted to
retain her anonymity. That it is unfair to identify just one party.
The usual suspects are rolled out, in the febrile atmosphere
surrounding a high-profile rape case, to ask fervent questions about why
a young woman, having wrongly blackened the name of a blameless young
man, should walk out of court with her anonymity intact. Very old
retired English judges, very hardline Conservative MPs, very supportive
members of the Police Federation erupt in righteous indignation that an
upright officer is tarnished by exposure.
It may be unfair, on general principles, that a defendant in a rape
trial who is found not guilty should have his privacy invaded and his
reputation besmirched while the accuser goes unidentified. But fairness
and justice are not always identical.
Anyone accused of any crime who is later acquitted suffers just this
seemingly unfair public exposure. It is seen as part of the inevitable
price to be paid for an open prosecution system and a free press, both
of which are ultimately conducive to justice.
Perhaps the reverse of the question ought to be asked. Should the
defendant in a rape case remain anonymous until the verdict is reached?
The starting point in such cases must be a presumption against
anonymity for anyone involved in a trial, says Strathclyde law professor
Gerry Maher, who is also an advocate. There are, however, obvious
reasons why a woman should not be identified in such cases: ''People
would be discouraged from reporting such cases, from seeing them through
in court.
''Justice has to be seen to be done. You need good reasons whenever
you cloak anything in anonymity. With the complainer whose sexual
history will be gone into, there are good reasons. We should be
encouraging victims to report such matters.
''I am not convinced that from the perspective of the accused, rape is
different from any other crime. Why should it be treated differently
from any other case?''
A person cleared by a jury, believing themselves to have been
maliciously accused, already has a remedy in law, says Professor Maher:
''There is a remedy in defamation. Yes, he accepts there is a general
assumption that there is no smoke without fire. That is true of every
kind of case. Affording an accused anonymity in such a case would be a
restriction of the freedom of the press and of the public interest in
knowing how justice operates.
''I incline towards a strong presumption that everything is public,
and you need very convincing reasons for it to be otherwise. I am not
convinced those reasons exist in these types of cases.''
In England, until 1988, defendants in English rape trials were given
anonymity until the outcome of the case was proven. But this special
treatment was not out of consideration for their own reputations. Rather
it was to protect their victims whose identities might have been
incidentally revealed by naming the accused.
The law is determined to protect the anonymity of victims in rape and
sexual assault cases on the grounds that, unlike other crimes, rape is
thought to bring disgrace upon the victim. Very few women, it is
assumed, would report a sex assault or go into the witness box if a
trial guaranteed public exposure. It is argued that rape cases form the
only crime where somebody is said to have consented to the assault. If
someobody is hit over the head with a brick, the accused can hardly
claim the victim agreed to be bludgeoned.
Alex Prentice, president of the Edinburgh Bar Association, is
concerned at the effects of publicity on those cleared of sensitive
charges such as rape.
''The whole argument brings into stark contrast the two competing
interests. One is the right of the public to know what goes on in the
courts, while on the other hand, there is no doubt in my view if some
protection is not afforded to people in sensitive cases -- and I mean
the victims of rape -- there is a grave danger that women would not come
forward and report these matters. They will feel their whole personal
lives are to be exposed.''
So while the legislation that protects the complainant is right, and
the practice of limiting the types of questions defending counsel can
ask of a witness about her sexual history is absolutely right, says Mr
Prentice, there is a difficulty that the accused has to suffer the whole
process in the public eye. He adds: ''It is a dangerous road to go down,
to say perhaps we should have courts in secret sitting because that way
the interest of the parties concerned would be satisfied. I am certainly
not in favour of that. It denies access to the courts and the public
interest to know what is going on.''
People rely on the media to see what is happening in courts: ''It does
throw up problems. There is no doubt that what happened in this case is
that the whole thing was so high profile that the young man will be
recognised and people will form their own views about the case and about
him.
''My immediate reaction is that I am against censorship for anyone.
Perhaps the ideal would be to allow a defendant in such a case anonymity
until a verdict is reached. If it were possible to formulate some sort
of rule, those wrongly accused would be better protected.
''There are cases where people are maliciously or wrongly accused of a
crime and appear in court. The purpose of the criminal court is to
determine a matter of fact and make a finding for or against. There is
something to be said that in certain types of cases which are sensitive,
sexual cases, the fact that such a case is taking place and details of
the evidence could be reported without identifying the parties.
''It would, though, have to be thought out very carefully because
extremes are easy to look at. It is easy to see the injustice in this
one. How you devise such rules is the much more difficult question.
Lawyers always try to look at procedures, not individual cases. Yes, I
think something could be done.''
Ordeal by trial for victim
MARTHA was raped four years ago by a neighbour in a block of flats.
She was so violently beaten that her mother failed to recognise her in
hospital. She speaks with warmth of the support and kindness she
received from the police officers who dealt with the case, and the
counselling help she was offered by Rape Crisis. But her view of the
court procedures which she likens to being stripped naked in a public
place involves a lot of strong language.
''The only thing that kept me going was anger,'' she says. Anger at
the man who attacked me, anger at his bloody lawyer who made me out to
be a slag and fury that I felt I was on trial, which is a cliche but
none the less was the case.
''The trial made salacious reading and was widely reported. If I had
believed for one minute that I would have had to expose myself to the
wider public gaze I could not have gone to court.
''I saw the man who attacked me go to prison. I had that. And I got my
life back when he did. But if I had thought that every time I went to
the local shop people would know the vile things he did, the indignities
I was put to, I think I might have killed myself.''

Niall McKay reports on an action replay of the video war
THE electronics industry faces a new battle as Sony and Toshiba
prepare to launch competing video disc formats. Sony, rather than join
forces with Toshiba, will now go own its way on home video technology.
Sony, together with Philips, will back their Digital Disc Standard
because it will work with all current CD-Rom drives and compact disc
players on the market, the companies say.
The Toshiba-backed technology, because it is a double-sided disc, will
require customers to buy new players.
However, industry watchers are sceptical that either standard will be
successful because neither can be used to record sound, video, or
computer data.
The argument arose as consumer electronic companies such as Sony,
Toshiba, and JVC began to look for a follow-up to the video cassette
recorder. Toshiba created its own standard, a double-sided disc that is
designed to cope with sound, computer multi-media and video and has a
high capacity which will carry up to 270 minutes of video.
The Toshiba technology has been backed by Matsushita, owner of JVC,
and the largest consumer electronics firm in the world. More
importantly, it has the backing of major Hollywood studios.
In the opposing camp, Sony and Philips, backed by Sony's Columbia
studios, will produce a single-sided disc which is also high capacity
and can carry up to 135 minutes of video, half that of the Toshiba
technology by virtue of its single-sidedness.
But the backing of the studios is crucial to the success of the
technology because both companies are betting on a new market for video
disc releases of the major motion pictures something that US-based
electronics consultancy Yankee Group believes is foolish.
''According to our surveys people most use their VCRs for recording
programmes from the television. But with Digital Video Discs you cannot
record anything and that is going to be the hamstring of this new
technology,'' said Russell Carrick, an analyst with Yankee.
According to Carrick there is no basis for believing that there is a
market for video discs of motion pictures, indeed quite the contrary.
The studios already release pre-recorded movies, but according to a
Yankee group survey most customers still prefer to rent videos.
Another great hindrance to the take-up of this technology will be the
cost of disc players. Both Toshiba and Sony say that this new format
will cost about $500.
''Five hundred dollars for yet another set of hardware, that can't
even record; let's face it, it is not going to be an easy sell,'' said
Carrick.
Both new formats are high-density discs which means that they can hold
twice the amount of conventional computer CD-Roms.
Sony says that it believes that the quality of its new technology will
be enough to sell its digital video discs. ''We believe there is no
difference that can be detected by the naked eye between this technology
and our professional DI broadcast equipment,'' said Sony spokesman Rick
Clancy.
Clancy said Sony had reviewed the Toshiba standard but had preferred
its own.
''After all, it was Sony and Philips who invented the compact disc,''
said Clancy.
Sony admits that the market for motion picture video releases may not
be the gold mine they had anticipated but says that it expects to sell a
great deal of products in the CD and CD-Rom market.
However, Carrick says: ''Sony continuing to back a competing standard
can only be bad for everybody. It will create another Betamax
disaster.''

SINCE the seventeenth century, when Moliere's character Tartuffe
begged that the decollete he craved to see be covered up for the sake of
decency, France seems to have been immune to the worst forms of bigotry.
In recent weeks, however, provincial associations pursuing a crusade
on public morality have scored unprecedented victories by frightening
local authorities into banning posters they consider unsuitable.
In January, triangular paper fig leaves were applied to posters
showing a nude couple -- Adam and Eve -- for a play at a theatre in
Lille. Last week, the poster for Robert Altman's latest film, a satire
on the fashion business entitled Ready to Wear in the US and
Pret-a-Porter in France and the UK, was withdrawn from buses and Metro
stations in Lyon by the city's public transport authority.
Designed for the French market, the poster shows three naked, finely
proportioned women walking towards the viewer, while a band announcing
the title of the film covers their crotches.
Far more explicit and less beautiful female nudes abound on the
nineteenth-century statues, usually of famous and fully dressed men,
which stand in the squares and parks of every French city. But the
transport board of Lyon, to the fury of film distributors Gaumont-Buena
Vista, ruled that ''the very wide range of ages, susceptibility, and
beliefs which must be taken into account in the context of a public
service'' made the poster, so to speak, undesirable.
It remains visible in the city's bus shelters, run by a different
company. The poster for Pret-a-Porter has been given the go-ahead by a
Ministry of Culture Commission which has banned the poster for Barry
Levinson's film Disclosure, starring Michael Douglas and Demi Moore:
Harcelement, or Harassment, it is called here.
Their decision was overruled by Culture Minister Jacques Toubon but
the poster, which in France shows Miss Moore fully-dressed sitting
astride Mr Douglas's equally clothed lap above the slogan, ''Sex is
power'', has just been banned by the mayors of Versailles and
Aix-en-Provence.
The poster has also attracted the hostility of the Association
Familles en France, one of whose members described it curiously as ''an
invitation to sexuality at every street corner of a sort which can
spread Aids''.
Founded after the war, Familles en France has 160,000 members and
defends consumer interests while keeping a close eye on government
economic policy regarding the family.
Independent of church, political party, or trades union, it also
campaigns against television programmes it considers unsuitable and
chat-line services available on Minitel, the popular telephone-linked
home computer.
The president of Familles en France in the deeply respectable town of
Aix-en-Provence succeeded in having the poster for Disclosure withdrawn
by informing the socialist mayor of members' objections.
They were passed on to Decaux, the nationwide firm which rents poster
hoardings and is a leading supplier to town halls. The posters were
withdrawn and Decaux, who also put up the fig leaves in Lille, now
angrily refuses to comment on the matter.
Members of Familles en France yesterday had difficulty explaining why
the poster was offensive. One of the few women who would talk, Madame
Bernard de Pierrefeu, said: ''What shocked me was that the town was full
of them. All at eye level. You could have put up with one or two, but
not 20 or 30 along a boulevard.''
Her brother-in-law, Emmanuel de Pierrefeu, a father of four, said the
posters ''could have an unfortunate effect on young people, especially
those from poorer backgrounds, an effect which may only become evident
in 20 years time''. But what?, I ask. ''Destructuration and
deformation,'' he said.
Familles en France have found unlikely allies among feminists. The
lawyer Gisele Helimi, who made her name in the campaign to legalise
abortion 20 years ago, protested the poster was ''pornographic'', the
film a ''profound perversion''.
''Its theme is that real power is sex, and sex is the power of women.
Thus women do not have the right to claim any other power,'' she said.
Gaumont-Buena Vista, meanwhile, are still flummoxed that their poster
for Pret-a-Porter was ruled offensive in Lyon.
''Other posters exploit women's bodies to produce consumer products,''
said the firm's managing director, Pierre-Ange Lepogam. ''We try to
produce something very elegant, very beautiful. But despite these rows,
France fortunately remains a country of liberty.''

Munich, Friday
GERMANY'S engineering sector was plunged into its first strike in 11
years today as thousands of workers in the rich southern state of
Bavaria downed tools to fight for more pay and a shorter working week.
IG Metall, which, with three million members, is the largest union in
the Western world, called out 11,000 workers at 20 firms in an
indefinite strike. It plans to extend the stoppage.
''Our goal is clear. We want a wage rise. We do not want existing wage
agreements to be undermined,'' the union's president, Klaus Zwickel,
told a news conference in Munich.
Around 33,000 workers in at least 50 firms in other German regions
stopped work for a few hours in sympathy token strikes.
In Baden-Wuerttemberg, 20,000 workers from Mercedes-Benz, part of
Germany's largest industrial group Daimler-Benz, staged short token
strikes and demonstrations.
The union has produced a plan for a step-by-step acceleration of its
action, hitting 12 more firms from Wednesday and a further seven from
March 6.
A spokeswoman for the union said participation had been ''very high''.
Strikers had been enthusiastic but disciplined, with no violence. The
mood was generally excellent.
Firms hit by the action, which could set the tone for wage claims in
the rest of German industry in this year's pay round, included
engineering giants Siemens, AEG, and MAN.
The Gesamtmetall employers' federation has resisted making a
counter-offer to the union's 6% claim, insisting that workers first
agree to the need for cost-cutting in firms the employers say are still
suffering from recession.

Brussels, Friday
POLICE in the Belgian town of Bruges are on red alert for the arrival
of thousands of English football fans, including renowned troublemakers,
for Tuesday's European Cup Winners' Cup clash between Club Brugge and
Chelsea.
''If you ask me whether I expect problems, yes I do,'' said Bruges
police chief commissioner Roger De Bree.
''We are not panicking, but alarmed, so that people cannot say
afterwards, you should have known. We know, we're expecting problems,''
he said.
The quarter final, first-leg game, an 18,000-ticket sell-out, is the
first overseas excursion by English fans since a riot in Dublin earlier
this month caused an Ireland-England international to be abandoned.
At least 11 policemen were hurt when supporters ripped out seats,
hurled chairs, and invaded the pitch early this month in an FA Cup tie
between Chelsea and Millwall.
''We're concerned
. . . despite all the measures we took, we still have visions in the
back of our mind of what happened in Dublin and in Millwall with some of
those extremist supporters,'' said De Bree.
He said he was not concerned about Chelsea's 2162 ticket allocation
which went to supporters travelling on club-organised packages.
Nor was he too worried about a second group of fans who also obtained
tickets but cannot be segregated from Belgian fans. ''They can be
located,'' De Bree said, ''but it's a third group that's the main reason
for our concern, those who think they'll get a ticket here.''
Club Brugge secretary-general Jacques De Nolf said he thought about
1500 extra English fans would show up, but De Bree said he expected
between 600 and 800, including about 100 violent right-wing fans, to
travel to Belgium.
Some of those were also involved in the Dublin riot, he said.
''Certainly, we know that, even some of their leaders. They have
officially booked, we know where and how,'' De Bree said.
He made it clear he was prepared for the worst. ''For those who want
to try, we'll act fast, vigorously, and without hesitation,'' he said.
Asked whether this meant police would use the baton, he said ''at
least''.
He said about 500 police and paramilitary police equipped with water
cannons, dogs, horses, and barbed wire would be patrolling in Bruges and
around the stadium, which is outside the centre of town.
De Bree said he feared fans without tickets would seek alternatives
and go to three nearby coastal towns, Heist, Blankenberge, and Ostend,
which will be holding carnival celebrations the same night.
He said he was also aware some fans thrived on the prospect of
fighting. ''Some don't care at all if they get busted,'' he said. ''They
prefer a conflict to draw attention to themselves.''--Reuter.

* The Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland has
written to President Bhutto urging her to ensure continuing protection
for the two Christians acquitted of blasphemy charges under which they
faced death by hanging, writes JAMES ROBERTSON.
The Rt Rev Dr James Simpson has also asked for continuing measures to
protect the lawyers who represented the Masihs and others ''threatened
by extremists''.
While acknowledging ''the effectiveness of Islamic jurisprudence'' in
the two particular cases, Dr Simpson has urged the Pakistan Government
to introduce judicial procedures ''which may prevent innocent people,
especially from vulnerable minorities, being unjustly charged with
blasphemy''.
The Kirk had sent a strong protest at the death sentences and called
on its members and others to help put pressure on Pakistan to have the
boy and his uncle released.
The judges' decision was welcomed with delight by the Kirk when it was
announced.
In his letter, Dr Simpson refers to the ''relief'' it brought to the
Church and its many members who have worked with Pakistan's people in
medical, education, and other projects.

Gordon McLaughlin, 39, left Mrs Mary McClelland for dead in her
Paisley home after he punched her face and tried to strangle her with a
tea towel.
McLaughlin, of Shortroods Crescent, Paisley, was found guilty of
attempting to murder Mrs McClelland on September 17 last year in her
home at Broomdyke Way.
He was found not guilty of stealing the woman's sleeping pills and her
purse.
During the three-day trial, the court was told that McLaughlin was
trapped by his footprints in the widow's blood on the kitchen and
bathroom floor.
Forensic experts linked the footprints to the same pattern on
McLaughlin's trainers, and matched bloodstains on one of the soles to
the victim.
Mrs McClelland had to endure the further ordeal of describing the
horrific attack from the witness box.
She broke down in tears several times as she told how McLaughlin, the
son of a neighbour she had known for 20 years, knocked on her door and
asked for a spare set of keys.
Mrs McClelland, an angina sufferer who had just been released from
hospital five days earlier, told Mrs Valerie Stacey prosecuting, how she
was pushed into the hallway, seized round the throat by McLaughlin and
punched on the face.
She said she could not breathe and thought she was going to die, and
told how in her desperation she clawed at McLaughlin's long hair and
beard before she blacked out.
A pathologist was called in to examine the woman in hospital.
She dislosed that marks round her neck had been caused by a ligature,
possibly a bloodstained tea towel which was found near the spot where
Mrs McClelland collapsed.
In evidence, McLaughlin could not explain how the blood on his
trainers, a sock, and his shirts cuffs had come to be there. He claimed
the elderly woman must have been mistaken when she named him as her
attacker.
After the unanimous guilty verdict, defence counsel Mr John Morris
told Lord Prosser that McLaughlin came from a good home and had never
displayed violence before.
Sentencing him, the judge said: ''It is very sad when one finds
someone with no signs of violence in his background and from a good
background, committing a crime such as this.
''This was an awful crime and I cannot elaborate on that.''

Paris, Friday
A SPY row between Paris and Washington turned bitter today when the US
embassy accused France's Interior Minister Charles Pasqua of lying about
who leaked news of the incident.
Pasqua told a newspaper there were ''many leaks from the American
side'' after France asked Washington to recall five Americans, including
four diplomats, whom Paris accused of industrial and political
espionage.
The US embassy in Paris hit back in an angry statement. It said: ''We
categorically reject the allegation that we are responsible for the
detailed and totally regrettable press leaks. This charge is neither
true nor credible.''
The embassy's unusual rebuttal was more reminiscent of Franco-Soviet
Cold War rows than of relations between two allies -- even though the
two have a history of arguing over everything from Nato to Hollywood
films.
The State Department in Washington has dismissed as ''unwarranted''
accusations of spying said to have been carried out by five people who
Paris suspects of working for the Central Intelligence Agency.
Today America's Paris embassy accused Pasqua of giving an ''inaccurate
and incomplete'' account of his conversations with US Ambassador Pamela
Harriman, which it said should have been protected by diplomatic
confidentiality.
Pasqua, already deep in trouble over a French phone-tapping dispute,
told Le Monde newspaper: ''There was no desire on our part to publicise
this.
''It was owing to the delay by the United States in settling this
affair.''
He said he had asked Ambassador Harriman to keep the affair quiet when
first telling her last month that Paris had ample evidence against five
US agents who it wanted recalled.
The embassy hit back: ''We scrupulously respected the confidentiality
agreed on during Ambassador Harriman's first meeting with Minister
Pasqua on January 26.''
French Foreign Ministry sources suspect the initial leaks came from
Pasqua's own Ministry to distract attention from the phone-tapping row
which has dented Prime Minister Edouard Balladur's hopes of election as
president in the April-May elections.--Reuter.

Washington, Friday
SENATOR Phil Gramm, of Texas, became the first Republican formally to
declare his candidacy for the presidency today.
It was not a big surprise: he has been running ceaselessly for the
nomination since George Bush lost in 1992, but this is all part of the
traditional rites of presidential politics.
These ceremonies are chiefly about raising money: Mr Gramm, the
unrivalled fund raiser, obtained $4.1 (#2.7m) yesterday, in a
synchronised series of televised events around the country.
Senator Gramm summoned a great gathering of supporters to his old
university in Texas, where once he taught economics, and pitched his
case in the monotonous drone that is his usual style of speaking.
He said: ''I was conservative before it was cool to be conservative,''
and offered himself as the anti-government, anti-taxation,
anti-regulation candidate.
This was the theme of the congressional election last year, when the
Democrats lost Congress, and it awakes many echoes.
He might take elocution lessons -- not to lose his Texas drawl, but to
learn some of the tricks of public speaking. Bill Clinton, Ronald
Reagan, even George Bush are far more persuasive, even when mouthing the
most empty platitudes, than Mr Gramm's whining drone, though what he has
to say is serious and deserves serious consideration.
He will also have to battle the image that does him so well in Texas.
He likes to think himself relentless, tough, aggressive, telling hard
truths as he sees them. He comes across as mean, unpleasant, and
vindictive.
People want a pleasant conservative, like Mr Reagan, someone they can
like. Mr Gramm is not very likeable. He will also have to contend with
the residual prejudice in northern parts against people with his sort of
accent.
''I will make balancing the federal budget my first priority,'' he
said. ''I will not run for re-election if I don't get the job done.''
He proposes to achieve this laudable objective by cutting welfare and
foreign aid, and by freezing all other government spending for long
enough to allow revenue to catch up with expenditure. He wants to allow
American families to decide how to spend money on education, housing,
and nutrition, instead of leaving it up to the government.
President Clinton and the Democrats reply that some families are
richer than others, and in a just society should help those less
fortunate. Mr Gramm offers the uncharitable face of modern America,
without apology.
He proposes to stop building prisons like Holiday Inns, and to
increase prison sentences for violent crimes (10 years for having a gun
while committing a crime, 20 for using it, death for murder). He
deplores the increase in numbers of children born out of wedlock, but
did not mention the wedge issue that may yet split up the Republican
monolith: abortion.
He also wants to increase defence spending: ''Even in the world where
the lion and the lamb are about to lie down together, the United States
of America must be the lion.''
Although he has raised far more money than anyone else, he has yet to
achieve a breakthrough in the polls. Senator Bob Dole, who will make his
own formal announcement in April, is far ahead of him.
However in 1975, no-one had heard of Jimmy Carter and in 1991, Bill
Clinton was just one of many Democratic hopefuls. Mr Gramm is a
formidable challenger.
* The US today began releasing once super-secret Cold War spy
photographs in a move long sought by historians, scientists, and
environmentalists.
President Clinton has ordered about 886,000 declassified satellite
images to be made public over the next 18 months through the National
Archives and the US Geological Survey. The images were collected from
1960-1972.

Brussels, Friday
MINISTERS from the world's seven richest nations begin talks on
developing a global information highway today amid mounting fears that
the road will be hogged by US cultural traffic.
France, Canada, and Italy have come to the meeting of the Group of
Seven (G7) Ministers, which also includes Britain, the United States,
Germany, abd Japan, stressing that they will not let their cultures be
drowned in a 21st century world dominated by computers, telephones, and
television.
''We feel that in spite of the globalisation of culture, it's
important to have diversity and to have high-quality imput. This is a
position that comes naturally to Canada, we are a vast country,'' said
Canadian Heritage Minister Michel Dupuy.
He added: ''We are particularly sensitive to the overflow of American
culture into Canada.''
In a recent speech he warned: ''While millions of children zero in on
the task of zapping video game characters into oblivion, should we be
concerned . . . that our culture may also be zapped out?''
Earlier this month French Culture Minister Jacques Toubon said France
would not allow any move at the meeting to advance the building of a
superhighway which ignored cultural concerns, and warned France's
European partners to protect their cultures against American
''colonisation''.
Telecommunications Minister Jose Rossi, who will represent France at
the meeting, said Paris would allow the information market to be opened
only if fair competition and cultural diversity could be guaranteed.
The United States, Germany, and Britain do not share these fears.
The information superhighway embraces the increasing use of computers,
telephones, and televisions, linking consumers with services and with
each other across the globe, that is expected to revolutionise
communications in the 21st century.--Reuter.

WHEN Allan Campbell, Scotland's director of coaching and development
for badminton, learned this week that the Scottish Sports Council is
providing #35,000 for elite competitors, his reaction was mixed.
Victory with the budget he drew up, and the case he argued, means that
when Glasgow hosts the World Championships next year, his players will
be better prepared than for any previous event in their history.
But his pleasure was put in perspective when he heard that another
budget, which he drafted before quitting his last coaching post, in
Australia, had also been approved. The Aussie Olympic badminton squad
has been told they have #300,000 per year to spend.
''I'm not on a percentage, more's the pity,'' he said. ''But that
shows what we are up against.''
Campbell served as Scottish coach up to 1989, then took over as head
coach at the South Australian Sports Institute, in Adelaide. ''My state
budget was four times what I'd had as national coach in Scotland.''
The #35,000 received by the Scottish Badminton Union was in response
to a request for #154,000, a generous one given limited council funds,
but one which illustrates that even in victory, Scottish sport is
falling further and further behind.
Germany, one of Scotland's World Championship group rivals, have a
full-time Danish coach whose sole responsibility is their national
squad. Most players are also full time, and have financial backing to
play the grand prix circuit -- a package worth about #100,000 per year
for a dozen top players and their coach.
Malaysia's players, also in Scotland's world section, are all
full-time -- it is the country's national sport, and their champions are
enormously wealthy, yet Scotland came within three points of beating
them at the Commonwealth Games last year in Victoria.
Canada, Scotland's other rivals, have as full-time squad coach, the
Scottish Commonwealth Games gold medallist Billy Gilliland, who has an
annual budget of #100,000 for his squad.
Despite being shoestring poor relations, Campbell believes Scottish
players: ''can be the equal of the best in the world. We have got it --
there's no doubt in my mind. The top Chinese juniors are full-time by 15
-- but we have the same talent, and better skill levels.
''The money does not mean we can have full-time players yet, but we
may soon be able to go down that path, which will totally change the
face of badminton. With support, a youngster may be able to face a few
years being unemployed, and take the chance of playing in the Far
East.''
That will introduce players to as sharp a learning curve as the one
which Campbell leapt on to, changing his perception of fitness.
Having worked with Chinese and Malaysian coaches, he has devised his
own blend of Eastern and Western methods. ''An Asian singles player,
when he trains on court, will work out for an hour without resting.
He'll come off knackered. When I started that with Scottish players, the
best lasted only six to eight minutes.
''They are now lasting 50 minutes, doing simple routines, wearing
heart monitors which beep if they let up on the required pace.''
Another technique is overloading. The coach takes 20 shuttles, whacks
them three times as fast as they would come in a match, so that the
player is forced to make strokes thrice as fast. ''Having experienced
that, under pressure in a match, it seems easy,'' says Campbell.
He wants Scots juniors to adopt the Aussie work ethic: ''far better
than ours,'' he insists. ''But they are given professional advice in
time management. Juniors know the basic requirement is a minimum of 14
hours' training a week. Then they are asked how much time they need for
studies, socialising, and so on. My aim is to introduce the same system,
including the input of sports psychologists.''
Psychology is an integral part of Australian preparation, yet Scots,
claims Campbell, have a head start. ''Players like Jenny Allen and Ken
Middlemiss are a sport psychologist's dream -- a lot of Scots have got
it. We are great fighters. In recent years our teams have beaten teams
which on paper should have annihilated us.''
Shades of Jock Wallace and the Rangers treble-winning team of the late
'70s, the Aussie badminton players run up sand dunes: ''Nothing to do
with developing fitness, more mental strength,'' says Campbell.

IN the competitive world of international racing, Sandra Wilson ranks
as a late starter. Many of her Alpine rivals had won their first top
childrens' races by the time she first stepped onto snow with skis -- at
the age of 11 -- yet in the first season of her second spell as a
British team skier, at 23 she is making the kind of jumps up the world
rankings that earn respect.
If she can continue her improvement until the Scottish FIS
championships in April at Nevis Range, her target -- inside the top 100
women in the world -- will have been reached.
After having started at No.284, an ascent of similar proportions next
season would have Wilson performing on equal terms with the top groups
in the World Cup slalom.
Such disadvantages have no apparent impact on her competitive outlook
-- neither in rationalising a poor day or in setting future goals does
she look back and wish she'd started skiing earlier, or been born in an
Alpine country, not the West of Scotland.
After having learned on the few hundred yards of artificial mat at
Glasgow Ski Centre, the gritty, focussed philosophy which she has
maintained through two years on the Scottish team, and five years of
training and racing in the USA at Team Breckenridge -- between the ages
of 17 and 22 -- has served her well.
It also helped her through a knee injury which could have wrecked most
skiers' recreational sport, far less an international racing career.
The accident happened in 1992 and ended her first spell with the
British Development Squad. While warming up for a race in Les Arcs,
France, she skied through new snow into a hole at the side of the
training piste.
Severe ligament damage failed to halt Wilson, and after having
completed her rehabilitation season last year in America, she was
invited to join the British women's Europa Cup team last summer.
As a comeback season, she has made her intentions clear. Since before
Christmas she has been posting top-10 and top-15 results on the FIS
circuit, including a first in Super G and second in slalom in the USA.
Her best FIS ranking points scores came in GS in Morzine, France, where
she finished thirteenth, and in San Vito di Cadore, Italy, where she
placed twelfth.
Her resolve was further tested -- along with her team-mates -- when
her season's main target and a potential career highlight evaporated.
Having fought for selection to the team for her first world
championships, due to take place over the first part of this month, she
was dismayed at their cancellation, but true to form, there is a silver
lining.
''It was disappointing,'' she said, ''but I have to look on it that
I'll be skiing better when they're run next year, and therefore should
have a better chance of doing well. The team will, I'm sure, have to be
selected over again, but I don't intend to miss out.''
Lately she has moved up from the FIS circuit to compete at Europa Cup
level, a big step which, with the greater speeds and more demanding
courses, has proven a stumbling block for many British women.
''I think when you see the higher standard required, with everyone
taking more risks and going faster, it would be easy to be intimidated
by the step up to Europa Cup,'' said Wilson, ''but for me it was just a
greater inspiration to meet the challenge and make the improvements to
go faster.''
It is the Europa Cup and the World Cup women who have been making the
best results of the British ski teams this season -- typified by Emma
Carrick-Anderson's ninth in a Europa Cup slalom this week, her best
world-ranking score -- and Wilson believes their buoyant team spirit and
great coaching support are unique in the recent history of British ski
racing.
''I think the days when British skiers seemed to race only against
each other with the goal of being British No.1 are long gone,'' she
said. ''We go to races all over Europe and America now and we are shown
respect and in turn we're slowly proving we can compete with the best.''
However, in a week in which it has been highlighted that the average
debt of an unsupported top national athlete in the UK is in excess of
#5000 a year, unless Wilson can find a personal sponsor she, too, will
be back waiting tables through the summer to cut back on the debts which
a year of ski racing costing more than #8000 inevitably bring.
''It's true that, even looking in the short term, the reason I would
have to give up skiing would be because I couldn't afford to go any
further, not because I'd reached as far as I thought I could.''

IF THERE is such a thing as an archetypal Scottish striker, John
Robertson might be the one to fill the bill. Small, nippy, determined,
and brave, the Hearts man encapsulates all the traditional qualities
that many Scottish sports stars have demonstrated.
He is also one of a less common breed, a player who thinks a lot about
the game, and his own role in particular.
In fact, it may be his willingness to adapt, to extend his
contribution to the Tynecastle side that has resulted in his playing
what many, including this interviewer, believe to be the best football
of his career, this season.
At 30, he may have left it a little late to hit a peak but he would
not be the first striker to mature into his finest form at that stage.
There are many, including the player himself, who would argue that Mark
Hateley reached a new level at about the same age with Rangers and old
Ally McCoist, who reached his thirtieth birthday two years ago, was just
about at his best then.
Robertson has his own theories about why he is being mentioned in
dispatches again and gives the credit to the man in charge at Tynecastle
this season, Tommy McLean.
''I don't know if there is any secret about the way I am playing.
Maybe it has something to do with putting more responsibility on myself
whereas in the past I have played off others like Jimmy Bone and Sandy
Clark but we don't have that type of player at the moment and the
manager wants me to hold up the ball and be the elder statesmen of the
team up front.
''The manager told me at the start of the season that he felt there
was more to my game than being a penalty box player and I think people
are seeing that this season.''
Whatever the reason, Robertson admits to enjoying his football as
much, if not more, than ever. Being involved in build-ups and playing
with men like Jim Bett have helped give this long-serving Hearts star a
new spring in his step which might well propel him back into the
Scotland squad next month.
For a man who has spent all bar eight months of his career with
Hearts, the ability to rekindle enthusiasm is necessary. This is not any
slight on the Tynecastle club but any player with a club as prominent as
the Edinburgh club would have been entitled to think that a wee bundle
of medals would be in the top drawer after close to 14 years.
But Robertson does not have a major winners' medal to show off to his
three sons, Marc (7), Liam (4), and Scott (1) . . . ''Not yet,'' he adds
with some authority.
That is why the international appearances, all 11 of them, he has made
for Scotland are treasured memories and also why he is still quite
determined to recapture that dark blue shirt.
He has never been shy to let Scotland managers know in public if he
thinks he is getting a raw deal. Indeed, he recently told the world that
he felt he was entitled to be considered among the new lot of strikers
under the scrutiny of current chief Craig Brown.
That still stands, maybe even more so, as he sees ''B' internationals
go by without a mention of his name, yet he should be comforted by the
fact that Brown is well aware of Robertson's fine form of recent weeks
and has decided the Hearts man must be on the candidates' list for the
game with Russia next month.
The man himself believes that, if he continues to play well, he will
get another chance. ''I did think when I was younger that the Scotland
manager was inclined to stick with established players rather than use
men in form but I think Craig Brown has shown that he will pick the
player who is playing well at the moment.''
Robertson has been through too many lows, as well as highs, during his
career ever to bank on anything, of course, but, if that national
recognition did come, it would do his cause no harm when he gets round
to sorting out a contract at the end of the season.
He is due to complete his current agreement then and there has been
much speculation about his future. He takes it all pragmatically. Would
he like to play out his time at Tynecastle?
''It is not my decision but there's no doubt it would be easy for me
to go on playing here. Football is too unpredictable to be sure of
anything. I am suspended from the Celtic game today and if the lads who
come in are a success I may not get my place back.
''That is the way it is in this game and I am ready for whatever
happens. The manager might prefer to bring in someone younger next
season and that is his right.''
He admits to being ''not too chuffed' when he was left out of the team
earlier in the season but he holds no grudge towards the manager.
''People say he is ruthless but he is no different from any other
manager. Sandy Clark and Joe Jordan could be ruthless, too. It is the
law of the jungle out there and managers have got to get results.''
Perhaps the greatest irony in Robertson's career is that this one-time
Hibs supporter grew up to become the most successful scorer against Hibs
in the history of the Edinburgh derby.
To date he has beaten the Hibees keepers 21 times, and the chances are
he is not finished yet.
But closer examination of his background reveals that his family home
was very much a maroon and green centre, with dad a committed Hearts fan
and one brother, George, a Hibs supporter.
Another brother, Chris, played for Rangers and so there was no lack of
variety in the table discussions.
Sadly, his dad died long before John became a Hearts player, a move
that only came about after Hibs had missed their chance to sign the
budding star on a schoolboy form.
''I went to see Mr Hart but I think he was worried about Chris
persuading me to go to Rangers and insisted that I sign right away. I
wanted to go home and discuss the idea but that wasn't good enough. So I
never did sign.''
It is a moment of capital football history which Hibs fans will prefer
to have dumped in the shredding machine but proved a great blessing for
their rivals.
Signed from Edina Hibs in 1980, Robertson has gone on to score a total
of 262 goals for Hearts. He is chasing two milestones in league goals
scored for the club.
Willie Bauld's 183 is only three ahead of the current striker but the
overall league record of 206 held by Jimmy Wardhaugh is a wee bit
further ahead.
The only time Robertson has worn another colour of shirt, excepting
internationals, is when he spent eight months at Newcastle United after
deciding, in 1987 that maybe it was time to have a go at proving himself
down south.
'''It was good down there but I only started eight matches for them. I
suffered a stomach injury which developed into a hernia so I came back
up the road. It was a comfortable option to return to Hearts because I
was feeling a bit down after things hadn't worked out. I knew the place,
the people.''
He does occasionally wonder if he had tried again in England what
would have happened. ''But sometimes things just don't happen. Some
players seem to move around every two or three seasons but I have
enjoyed myself here. The one thing I wish had happened is that we had
won something.''
He has happy memories of good league campaigns, reaching semi-finals
and a Scottish Cup final but the long run of success in derby matches
has been the major comfort for Hearts fans, not to mention the players.
''The worst time was 1986, obviously, when we missed out on a league
and cup double inside a week. It took everybody at the club a long time
to get over it.''
Unlike others in the east, Robertson does not believe there is a west
bias when international sides are chosen but he does go along with the
view that there is a press bias in favour of the Old Firm.
However, he sees that as inevitable and sound business. ''If the great
majority of a paper's readers are either Celtic or Rangers fans, it
stands to reason that they will get bigger coverage than any others.''
His major ambition is to ''keep going'' and get back into the Scotland
pool. ''I also want, more than anything, to win something.''
Maybe this will be his year. It is about due, is it not?

LAST year's floods were a sharp reminder to everyone of how essential
it is to have adequate buildings and contents insurance. The premiums
may sometimes seem high, but the cost of repairing or replacing property
and possessions can easily run into thousands of pounds.
The good news for householders this year is that insurance premiums
should come down. This is partly due to a reduction in the number of
claims last year and the success of the crackdown on fraudulent ones.
But it also has much to do with increasing competition due to the
arrival of direct telephone insurance.
Even those in the flood affected area should not see premiums rise.
Most insurers regard the incident as the result of freak conditions
which are unlikely to be repeated.
But even if your premiums fall it does not mean you are getting the
best deal. The only way to be sure of this is to get quotes from other
companies and make comparisons. Price is not everything, though. Going
to a reputable firm that deals with claims quickly and sympathetically
is just as important.
Household insurance comes in two parts -- buildings and contents.
There is no need to have the same company for both. Even though you may
be offered a discount on a combined package, you could save more by
taking out cover with different firms.
Many people still insure their buildings using a policy recommended by
their mortgage lender, but this is not compulsory. Although a lender may
charge you an admin fee of perhaps #25 if you switch to another insurer,
you could soon recoup this if you pay a lower premium.
Insurers have become much more sophisticated in their calculation of
building premiums in recent years, introducing more detailed post code
banding and rates based on property age. Co-operative Insurance, for
instance, recently reduced its rates on property built since 1979 by up
to 16.5%.
Even greater variations are to be found in contents policies. To save
you adding up the value of every item you own, many companies set an
average sum based on number of bedrooms -- say #20,000 for a property
with three.
Though this method is convenient, it can mean you end up paying for
either more or less insurance than you need, and you could be better off
with a policy calculated the traditional way.
If your possessions are very modest you may find a company's minimum
sum is more than you need. However, there are some insurers with special
low cover policies. The Co-operative's Practical Policy allows you to
insure amounts as low as #5000, but it is only available for certain
post codes. Age Concern Insurance Services is prepared to insure amounts
from #6000 if you are aged 55 or over.
Another point to bear in mind is that standard cover is normally on a
new for old basis, so you have to insure for the cost of brand new
items. Cheaper cover which takes into account wear and tear can be
obtained under an indemnity policy. Another option is a limited cover
economy policy such as that offered by Churchill.
For those with more valuable possessions, conventional policies may
also be inappropriate. Hiscox, a leading insurer of higher value
households (contents worth more than #75,000), says insuring art and
antiques can be more expensive with a standard policy because insurers
levy premium rates on named items.
It claims to offer cheaper and more flexible cover, arguing that art
and antiques are actually far less popular targets for burglars than
videos and TVs. It would insure a house in, for example, East Kilbride
or Eaglesham with general contents and valuables worth #170,000 for just
#540 a year.
For more straightforward contents cover, ringing round a number of the
direct insurers such as Direct Line (0141 226 8477), Churchill (0500 200
345) and GA Direct (0800 121 004) should get you a competitive premium,
providing you have not made any claims over the past three years. You
can often get further reductions by improving door and window locks and
being prepared to pay a larger amount of each claim yourself.
If you have made a claim, depending on its size and nature, you may
not get such a positive response from a direct insurer. It is still
worth trying but you might also ask a local broker for quotes or try
Premium Search (0800 109 876), which deals with a panel of insurers and
claims to be able to find competitive premiums for all.

THE managers of investments trusts and unit trusts are still rolling
out new products to tempt the investor.
Soon the majority will be designed to take advantage of the new PEP
rules allowing corporate fixed-interest products to be tax sheltered.
Some are already, but there are still new offerings in the area of niche
or emerging markets -- particularly in investment trusts -- in spite of
the fact these have not been doing so well in more recent months.
So far as emerging markets are concerned, Mexico and China have
demonstrated the wisdom of all the warnings that these sorts of market
are risky and volatile and not for widows, orphans or those who prefer
their sleep untroubled. Turkey and some Eastern European countries have
driven home the same lesson, but being smaller have been less
noticeable.
Should the private investor buy more now that they are ''cheaper'' or
retire disappointed and forget the whole thing? It is a matter of taste
and nerve. If you have a taste for emerging markets you probably have
the nerve too. If you have not, you have not understood them or have
taken too short a view, which probably amounts to the same thing.
On the positive side, the setbacks, for which it is possible to blame
the ripple effect of higher US interest rates, have probably slowed down
a lot of the emerging markets but have not necessarily really damaged
them long term.
This is particularly the case when you consider the Asian and Pacific
rim countries. These now seem to be generating growth among themselves
and to have good personal savings ratios (unlike, say, Turkey). This
means they are no longer as dependant as they were on the Western
economies for their progress. If you want to worry about the negatives,
you can focus on the prospect of US and Japanese investment funds being
repatriated.
The traditional reason for the launching of specialist funds, where
the managers concentrate their talents for judging economies and picking
stocks in single geographical or business areas, was that there would be
a ready market among the big investing institutions, pension funds and
so on, which would like to have some exciting overseas exposure but
would not find it appropriate or cost effective to recruit their own
analysts.
Private investors soon caught on to the idea that it would be nice for
them to have a bit of spice too, and they joined in in varying
percentages.
A traditionalist might argue that selections of this sort should be
left to the professionals. The private investor, at least the smaller
one, should stick to the large and long-established general trusts,
leaving the decision about whether money should be in or out of Mexico
to the experts. Sound advice no doubt, but provided you have a core of
pretty safe stuff, it is hard to ignore the temptation to try to do a
bit better elsewhere.
One market which has been largely ignored in all this specialisation
is Canada. Maybe there are good reasons for this. Perhaps the
institutions feel they know the big Canadian stocks well enough to make
their selections for themselves. But that is unlikely to be the case
where private investors are concerned, although most of us will have
known about some distant relative who went to Canada to seek, perhaps
find and probably spend, his or her fortune.
Whatever the reason, stockbroker Olliff and Partners, which spends a
lot of time looking at closed-end investment companies overseas, is
seeking to fill the gap by sponsoring a UK listing for one of Toronto's
largest companies in this category with a history going back to 1930.
The company is Canadian General Investments which is listed in Toronto
and has assets of something over $C188m.
The case for Canada, as outlined by Michael Smedley, president of the
company, is that ''current estimates of GNP growth are still in the 4%
plus area and inflation is under control''. Corporate earnings are
growing and, while the Canadian dollar has been hit by US interest
rates, he says, a cheap dollar is good news for exporting companies.
Canadian General seeks to grow both capital and income, and its
present policy is to pick its stocks from the top 300 listed on the
Toronto exchange. Its current portfolio has approximately 70 of them.
The company fought off an attempt by a group of investors in 1992 to
force it to become a mutual and, after a share buy-back and other moves,
is now 59% controlled directly and indirectly by chairman Louise Morgan.
As one of its moves to enhance shareholder value, it has just made a
one-for-five free issue of warrants.
By listing in the UK it clearly hopes to erode the discount. Before
the announcement of the warrant issue and the London listing proposal
the discount was around 29%. It fell to 21% following the announcement,
but after the shares went ex the warrant issue it widened again to 25%.
With the shares standing at around $C27.75, the warrants were just over
$C4.
Aside from all the risks associated with investing, prospective
investors are reminded that a referendum on the future of Quebec is
expected to be held this year. The company also faces a claim for some
$C6.7m related to the earlier buy-back but disputes the liability.
A purchase now is partly a bet on the discount narrowing, but if you
feel Canada is a gap in your portfolio this is one way of doing it.
What are the professionals doing? A recent survey of fund managers
carried out for Smith New Court found: ''Of the major global equity
markets managers are most bullish on the outlook for UK equities.''
But there was a sharp drop in previous bearishness on Wall Street
(only 1% were bears) and an increase in interest in overseas bonds and
deposits.

* I am a 26-year-old female with a degree in interior design but have
been unable to secure a permanent job in this field. I nonetheless have
not been unemployed, finding work in different areas of interest, for
example catering. I have not, however, made any pension arrangements and
none of my employers have invited me to join their scheme.
Conscious that my working pattern may be with a series of different
employers for short spells, what advice can you give? I do not have a
great deal of spare cash and am anxious to make sure that if I do enter
into a personal pension arrangement, the bulk of my contribution goes
into the scheme not expenses.
Can you suggest one or two companies which will meet my criteria and
which have historically provided good results? Further, if an employer
does offer a pension arrangement, what should I do? It would seem
sensible to take advantage of contributions from such a source. What
happens to my personal plan then? I also understand the Government
offers incentives to encourage personal pension arrangements. How do
these work?
* A personal pension plan would suit your circumstances and, as you
are proposing to start one at an early age, a relatively modest monthly
sum should suffice to generate an adequate pension, provided, as you
say, the plan has low expenses.
There are such schemes available from Foreign &amp; Colonial Investment
Trust and from the Dunedin group. However, these specify a minimum
payment of #100 a month which may be too much for you. Unit trust based
plans with a lower minimum are available from M&amp;G, Framlington and
Premier Investment Management. These companies have sound track records
and relatively low expenses.
Should you join an employer with a pension scheme it would be a good
idea to participate in it, or ask if he or she would make equivalent
contributions to your personal scheme. Should you join a company scheme,
you could no longer make contributions to the personal one, but you
could restart them if you changed employment.
The incentives you refer to are linked to the state earnings related
scheme. The Government provides an incentive to opt out of this if you
have a personal pension plan, but relying on this contribution alone
will not generate an adequate sum.
* I was under the impression that so long as a husband or wife was
over the age of 65, age allowance would apply to both. Did this change
with the advent of independent taxation? I have been refused the
allowance even though my income is now within the limit and my wife is
over 65.
* One of the main effects of independent taxation is that husband and
wife are treated as separate individuals, whereas before they were dealt
with jointly for most tax purposes. You will, therefore, not be entitled
to the age allowance until you reach 65.
However, the amount of the married couples allowance is relative to
the age of the older of the husband and wife, so you should qualify for
the age related married couples allowance. The level depends on your
income even though the allowance is due to your wife's age.
You will both be entitled to a personal tax allowance determined by
your own ages and income levels in addition to the age related married
couples allowance. Your wife is, of course, entitled to claim one-half
of the married couples allowance, but only up to the level of the basic
allowance, not the age related increase.
Electricity share price shock
* Why is it that the Scottish electricity companies continue to
languish in the doldrums? The price of the majority of companies in
Britain at privatisation was 240p. Last time I looked (February 14) all
the English companies had risen above 700p, to an astonishing 1091p in
the case of Northern Electric, while both Hydro-Electric and
ScottishPower were barely above 300p.
My question is simply this -- are their shares worth holding on to
over the medium term?
* The gains to be made out of investing in the English regional
electricity companies since privatisation have been extraordinary, but
it would be wrong to conclude from this that ScottishPower and
Hydro-Electric, whose directors have not enjoyed the lucrative share
options of their English counterparts, have not been worthwhile
investments.
Both have out-performed the FTSE-100 share index since their
flotations in June 1991. ScottishPower shares have risen by about a
third and Hydro's by a little less. By contrast, the Footsie is up just
20%.
However, both Scottish electricity companies made the 470s before
being dragged lower by regulatory clampdowns and the downward drift in
the stock market.
The English regionals are different animals. They were privatised
before the Scots, when the stock market was in the doldrums after the
Iraqis invaded Kuwait. The price was close to a give-away.
Indeed, the Scottish companies, which account for 10% of the
electricity in the UK, brought in 25% of the proceeds from electricity
privatisations.
The icing on the English cake has come from the Trafalgar House bid
for Northern Electric which has set the sector alight. The English
industry is fragmented and vulnerable to predators. The Scots companies
are protected by statute, and in any event are more substantial beings
with their own generating capacity.
ScottishPower is sporting a yield of 5%, Hydro a little more. Some of
the RECs are currently yielding less than 4%.
Paradoxically, this makes the Scottish companies more attractive
investments in the medium term on fundamental grounds, and a number of
leading stockbokers are currently recommending purchases of the shares.
What you do depends on what you hope to get out of your investment. If
it is an above average yield, a good dividend flow and some capital
appreciation, then ScottishPower and Hydro appear to fit the bill, but
if your aim is long-term capital growth, you should probably choose
another sector.
* My wife and I sold a property in Manchester some 18 months ago which
had previously been taxed under Schedule D as a managed letting
property. With part of the proceeds we have purchased another managed
letting property in Glasgow, but the Inspector of Taxes has refused our
claim to roll-over the gain arising on the Manchester property into the
Glasgow property as he claims that we have not been trading.
I was under the impression that if the income had been taxed under
Schedule D then the letting would be treated as trading and roll-over,
therefore, allowed. Is this incorrect?
* To qualify for capital gains roll-over relief, the assets being sold
and purchased must be used for the purpose of a trade. Income from
furnished letting, although taxed under Schedule D, is not classed as
trading income unless it falls within the furnished holiday letting
regulations.
These concern property used as commerical holiday accommodation, which
by its nature is mainly short-term lets as distinct from letting on a
longer-term residential basis.
Holiday accommodation must be available to the public generally for at
least 140 days in a 12-month period, and be let as such for at least 70
of these days. It must, however, not normally be let to the same person
for more than 31 consecutive days during a period of seven months in
that 12-month period. If the circumstances of your letting activities
fall within these rules, contact the Inspector again. If not, roll-over
relief will not be available.

EMPLOYERS could be forced to top up their employees' personal pension
plans if radical changes to the way retirement benefits are built up in
this country go ahead.
Other ideas include allowing employers to insist that new staff join
the company pension scheme as a condition of employment, and requiring
the self-employed to contribute 10% of their earnings to private plans.
These recommendations are among those now on the desk of Sir John
Anson, a former Treasury official, who is chairing an inquiry on how to
make sure all, not just some of us, can enjoy an adequate pension in the
future.
The inquiry team is expected to produce a report in the autumn
containing its ideas. But the sad truth is that, for many of us, it is
already far too late.
Pension provision in this country is in a mess. The Government's aim
to replace state provision with private plans has run into serious
trouble and company pension schemes are under pressure.
If the problems are not tackled now the future financial prospects for
millions of workers look very bleak indeed.
''We have been concerned about the future of pensions in this country
for some time,'' says Mike Brown of the National Association of Pension
Funds.
''Pensions come from three sources and they're all under threat. Most
company schemes are very good, but they cover only half the workforce.
That number is dwindling all the time as legislation becomes more
complicated and employers decide against setting up new schemes.
''Personal pensions have been claimed as a great success, but most
people are putting in only their National Insurance rebates and are on
very low earnings. So a high proportion of their contributions are being
swallowed up in insurance company charges.
''State pension benefits are raised in line with prices each year, but
that means they fall further and further behind people's earnings over
the years.''
The basic state pension was worth 20% of average earnings in the late
seventies, but now represents just 15% and will fall to below 10% early
next century.
But it's clear that we won't be able to afford even this meagre amount
without putting a huge burden on future generations of taxpayers. In
1960 there were four people of working age to support every pensioner.
By 1991 the ratio was even -- a worker for every pensioner. By 2030
there will be seven pensioners for every two workers, even taking into
account equalisation of state retirement age at 65.
''We believe that it is important to concentrate state pension
expenditure on those who need it most,'' says NAPF.
It wanted the Government to set up a Royal Commission to look at the
whole spectrum of pension provision, but the Government declined.
Presumably this would have been an admission of policy failure.
''What policy?'' some might ask. The Government may be trying to force
us all to take responsibility for our own financial future. But the
uncertainties of employment mean most of us have no real hope of
building up enough money during our working lives to see us comfortably
through our retirement.
Unemployment and redundancy, part-time working, short-term contracts
that promise a job for only six months or so, temporary placements and
job shares are all part of the scene these days -- and pensions can be
left out of the picture for years on end.
The problems of a uncertain job market are compounded by the
fragmented way pensions are provided. Each time we move in and out of
work, between different companies, and from employment to
self-employment we are usually forced to change our arrangements because
of complicated regulations. That, in turn, usually means incurring large
costs, and these eat into the already low amounts we've managed to save.
''Too many people are contributing too little towards their retirement
benefits,'' says NAPF. ''Since persuasion has failed, we believe an
element of compulsion is inevitable.''
It wants employers who run an approved pension scheme to be allowed to
insist on membership as a condition of employment. Making company scheme
membership compulsory was banned in 1988 and now a fifth of new
employees decide against joining their company's scheme.
Employees not covered by company schemes should be required to
contribute 5% of their salary to a private pension, with their employer
matching that. At present, in 95% of cases, employers do not pay any
extra contributions to their employees' personal pension plans.
The self-employed should be required to put 10% of earnings into a
pension plan. All benefits arising from private pensions should be
increased each year in line with inflation (up to 5%).
The payment of state benefits to the sick, unemployed, low paid and
those with family responsibilities should be supplemented by a credit
which must be invested in a private pension scheme.
These ideas are contained in NAPF's own submission to the Retirement
Income Inquiry, although it won't be taking part in examining the
evidence. Around 40 other organisations have also responded with ideas.
These include the Association of British Insurers, Age Concern and Help
the Aged, the TUC and the CBI.

'FEBRUARY,'' said Tom Conti, ''was a month of weird attractions.''
Perhaps he meant distractions. Voicing the repeated Fortean Review of
1994 (BBC2, Thursday), Conti described bizarre phenomena from around the
world but never mentioned authenticated sightings of Eastenders all over
the schedules. The Invasion of the Ratings Snatchers passed unremarked.
Odd isn't the word. What was once an honest, though grimly
self-conscious, effort to bring soaps within hailing distance of life
has suffered the worst fate the BBC can contrive: it has become, God
help us, an institution, and thus deemed capable of sustaining as many
repeats as sentience will stand.
To ''celebrate'' 10 years of domestic crises, h'issues, and pub
banter, we now have morning editions of Eastenders -- the Early Years,
our regular evening doses of fresh hell, the grisly weekend omnibus
edition and, on Friday night, the Unforgettable Eastenders.
Unforgettable, that is, because the BBC has no intention of allowing us
to forget it.
Watching Eastenders you would never think a decade has passed. Like
Coronation Street, the Square has become a hermetically sealed world all
of its own where, if you wait long enough, every tragedy known to man
will emerge from the script to devour a hapless actor who knows that the
real difference between life and soaps is unemployment.
Television executives defend the genre the way Henry Ford defended
production lines, and the result is the same: you can have any colour
you like as long as it's black, deep and grim. Soaps don't possess what
you might call dramatic structure, or even natural coherence, since
unlike real plays and daily existence they never end. ''But they're
organic, you see,'' say the execs. So too is lichen. This is life, Ange,
but not as we know it.
''And in Texas,'' said Conti, ''a pet pig called Priscilla rescued her
master from certain death.'' In London, a singer called Madonna, looking
like Gloria Swanson in a nylon wig and a C&amp;A nightie, was attempting to
do the same for her career. Smart money was on the pig.
As wind machines blew the lady's hairpiece towards the heavens, hordes
were clapping hands above their heads, this being the internationally
recognised signal for someone drowning in self-regard at a really duff
show, or ''gig'' as the people who made Sting as smug as he is today,
might call it.
Tense with excitement and free plonk, they waited to hear who had won
the coveted award for best British Sampled Drum Fill From an Original
30-year-old R&amp;B Track.
The strangeness of the Brit Awards 95 (ITV, Tuesday), contrary to all
the laws of rock and pop, was how young it could make you feel. Like
Eastenders, this is a world where nothing much changes, least of all the
hype. Chris Evans as compere, wearing a fruit salad as a suit, was
making desperate jokes about his ''pretend friends'' to prepare us for
the pretend music. Prince, looking like a public health warning, was
making allegorical remarks about his enslavement to the record company
that has given him all that money.
Meanwhile, the only rock'n'roll rebel among the lot was the
commentator. k d lang picked up an award for something or other and we
heard that she is ''an artist with great courage who has always done
things her way''. Otherwise Isaac Hayes wore dignity like a gold watch
and Take That plugged their new single.
What we had from the Alexandra Palace was another British industry
being celebrated in its decline. A decade from now Lord John of Elton
will be appealing for government intervention to keep this great
tradition of ours alive, darling. As it is, the world cares less and
less and, more to the point, television still doesn't know how to
present music.
It once knew how to make documentaries; now it makes vehicles for the
Clives James and Anderson, hooks into some dismal novelist's disturbing
fantasies, or pretends that the old story it is relating is ''untold''.
None of this constitutes good news for a form struggling to maintain a
toe-hold in the market-place.
Of the Clives, Anderson (BBC2, Fri) is as yet less glib than James
(BBC1, Tues). The former was Our Man In . . . Havana, the latter sent a
Postcard from Bombay. Fat Clive waddled and smirked through a spiritless
commentary on poverty and Bollywood, dipping his toe into the urban
cesspit for all the world like a sweating Alan Whicker, while eliciting
genuine, though irrelevant, laughter from his efforts to become a film
extra. Little Clive asked real questions and let the wit come naturally.
There's a difference.
Jumpers (C4, Monday) had three insurmountable problems: horses, the
people who ride them, and Jilly Cooper. Sooper went on, as usual, about
''beautiful looking men, awl tewwibly fit!'' while the men themselves
confessed to keeping their brains in their jodhpurs and blamed the
horses for every failure.
''Yorkshire lad, born and bred, strong in the arm and thick in the
head,'' admitted one. ''He's jumped three other horses today and none of
them has performed well,'' it was said of Harvey Smith's son, saying it
all.
''Going over a fence for me is better than having sex,'' remarked
Britain's only black equestrian, knocking down all the fences and giving
us a glimpse of his sex life. It were tripe, lad.
The trouble with Secret Lives (C4, Thurs), eviscerating the
egomaniacal racist bigot that was Walt Disney, was not that it was tripe
but that there was no secret. All this has been known for years, and the
film's complement of no fewer than three hostile biographers was
something of a giveaway. Disney signed his name to other people's
drawings and picked up 26 Oscars as a result. He didn't like blacks,
Jews, or unions and he preferred his mouse to women.
Did I hear ''wholesome''? Glam Metal Detectives (BBC2, Thurs) did not
attempt to be wholesome but, equally, did not trouble itself with
originality. Yet again, a debut trailed for weeks proved a waste of
time; yet again, TV's idea of comedy amounted to lame parodies of
television. Jack Nicholson plays Dr James Herriot? Droll as a migraine.
The show was intended to satirise the limited attention span of the
modern audience and did for mine in minutes.
''So where,'' as Agent Scully felt the need to ask on the X Files,
''does that leave us?'' ''One short step away from proving the
pre-existence of the human soul,'' replied her partner. Eastenders,
meanwhile, remains unfathomable.

DR J D DUNCAN clearly does not share my analysis of the effects of
poverty on health (February 22). He states that ''no study demonstrates
that stress occurs more often in one level of society than in any
other''. He should perhaps read the work of Professor Michael Marmot,
which shows very clearly the relationship between status, stress, and
ill health.
He takes me to task for comparing life expectancy in Sweden with that
of the US. I could have drawn an even starker comparison between Sweden
and Germany in which the inequality in income is even greater than in
the US and life expectancy is correspondingly less.
This positive correlation between and equitable distribution of income
and life expectancy is statistically robust. When Dr Duncan says there
is no evidence to support my analysis, what he means is that he is not
aware of the evidence. He may challenge its validity but he cannot deny
its existence.
Dr Duncan suggests that he saw no such relationship in the course of a
long career in general practice. If we are to descend to the level of
anecdote, all I can say is that in the course of a long clinical career
in surgery, in which I saw and operated on tens of thousands of
patients, the relationship was only too clear to me.
It is clear to public health and health promotion colleagues who meet
residents of deprived areas every day. It is clear to GPs who seek to
employ psychologists and counsellors to deal with the problem and, most
importantly, it is clear to the patients who have to cope with the
stresses of poverty with no prospect of employment.
Dr Duncan begins his letter by disingenuously quoting me out of
context. He finishes with an irrelevant and insulting sideswipe at
public health medicine. He demeans himself. This debate is literally a
matter of life and death for people living in deprived areas. They have
a right to expect that it be conducted seriously. Ill-informed comment
helps no-one.

ARGYLL and Clyde Health Council produced an extravagant annual
statement for 1993/94 with glossy covers, individual photographs of
staff, and a ridiculous coloured logo on each page.
They say it is necessary to communicate, but how many NHS patients
will see this document and will approve of this extravagant spending of

How can the cost of this council be justified when the NHS is so short

NHS staff are angered not only by the insult of the 1% pay rise
awarded nationally, but also the requirement to bargain locally for any
additional pay rise, as well as terms and conditions.
Most hospital trusts are not ready to negotiate locally and are being
pushed into it by the pay review body and the Government. Think of the
extra time involved that will have to be spent by each individual trust
negotiating ''locally'' its pay, terms, and conditions compared to the
time spent in a national negotiation.
National bargaining is a much fairer, appropriate, and efficient
method of determining pay, terms, and conditions.

IT is evident from the complaint of Brian Donohoe, MP, about Ayrshire
and Arran Health Board opting to send patients requiring cardiac surgery
to a private hospital, that he is out of touch with reality. The current
waiting list in the West of Scotland for heart by-pass surgery is 12
monthsa.
The sad fact is that unless some of those on the NHS waiting list for
such attention are fortunate enough to be referred to Ross Hall Hospital
by the health board they will not require surgery because they will be
dead before their turn for an operation in an NHS hospital comes up.
Brian Donohoe's complaint is a classic example of political dogma at
its worst.
Ayrshire and Arran Health Board has got it right. The needs of the
patient must always come first.

WHAT about a Euro-law to stop the unfair treatment of UK taxpayers? If
residents in the rest of Europe can buy low-priced whisky, beer, and
tobacco, why can't we?
Also, although we are oil producers, we pay virtually the same price
for petrol, probably because our oil revenue goes straight into EU
coffers.
However, such a law would never be passed as it would bankrupt Europe
and because, unlike us, they are not stupid.

A BILL to increase the size of health warnings on cigarette packs from
the current 6% to 25% of the surface area was not ''talked out'' by MPs
opposed to the measure (February 18).
The Bill failed to progress because the sponsoring MP, Labour's Terry
Lewis, failed to generate sufficient support among back benchers to vote
it through to the next stage.
Many MPs were rightly concerned that the Bill, if it became law, would
discriminate against UK tobacco companies in favour of our foreign
competitors, who would not have been subject to the Bill's requirements.

THE Prime Minister has asserted his view that he and his Cabinet were
helping to build a wider Europe but not a federal Europe. Allowing for
the obvious fact that Europe is Europe whichever way one turns the map
round, he expanded his assertion by saying that we had many historical
obligations to Czechoslovakia and Poland.
This is hard to understand unless he has inherited the guilt of a
previous generation in its surrender of these countries to communism
since the end of the Second World War. However, he went on to say that
he wished the extension of the free market and its principles, and the
wealth that exists in the West, towards the East.
The practical and already obvious result of his desired stratagem is
the further and accelerated transfer of wealth, through European Union
subsidy, from the already punitively-taxed German, British, and French
taxpayers to the inefficient and corrupt regimes of Eastern Europe. Such
a transfer demands a referendum in itself.
The Government's continuing reiteration of that shibboleth which
seduced us into membership of the original EEC, namely the free market,
must ring mockingly false in the ears of British farmers, fishermen, and
businessmen who are daily being bound ever more securely by unelected,
bureaucratic red tape from Brussels.
The Prime Minister urges us to look at the development of the European
Union pragmatically and consider whether its proposed direction is in
Britain's and Europe's interest.
To represent both interests as remotely similar is palpably dangerous
nonsense since the interest of the former must in every way be
diminished and impoverished as that of the latter expands and becomes
more powerful.
Regular contentions with Brussels on every facet of our commercial,
economic, judicial, and social life find British Ministers, with jutted
jaw, resolved to win their corner for Britain in Brussels. They never
do, and another piece of our independence and sovereignty is gone.
If only the Prime Minister would admit that he and his Cabinet are
puppets of international capitalism and its seeming inexorable march
towards world government, and make way for a leader worthy of the
British people. Meaningless, obfuscatory abstractions like shared
sovereignty and economic advantage are no longer sugared untruths
sufficient to deceive us.
Let us remind the Prime Minister that he is a servant of the people,
that the country belongs to its citizens, and that these citizens demand
a referendum on independence outside the European Union now, before any
more of our sovereignty is surrendered.

THE higher-profile Conservative Euro-sceptics are disproportionately
represented by Scots MPs even if they do not all represent Scottish
seats. The same MPs also appear to share a uniform distrust and even
revulsion at the prospect of what is commonly known as devolution for
Scotland but is more accurately described as ''democratic
subsidiarity''.
What they may favour discreetly for Ireland they dismiss for Scotland.
What they demand for Britain they hold in contempt for Scotland.
I have known many Scottish Conservatives of various generations but
most had one common value, rarely if ever spoken but to the root of the
matter. It was expressed to me as the level-headed capacity to be a
Scottish patriot in your heart but not your head.
Europe stands at a crossroads. The Euro-sceptics have two bleak paths
mapped out for Britain. One is splendid isolation, this time sans
empire, sans friends, sans anything save only sovereignty. The other is
their conception of a European Free Trade Area (EFTA). It was tried
before, it has been dead these 30 years. It is not on offer.
What is on offer is a European Union exemplified by a single market
and to be buttressed by a single currency. This is a choice for the head
and not the heart; it is a choice for raison d'etat and not for
sentiment.
It is not the choice of the Scottish Euro-sceptics -- Lamont, Taylor,
Cran, probably Lang and Rifkind -- but what do they stand for if neither
sentiment nor subsidiarity, free and unified markets nor strong stable
currency?
Who are these men and what do they believe in, if neither heart nor
head?

FORGIVE me for being dense but I thought we joined the EC years ago. I
thought the majority of UK residents wanted and still do want
membership.
The reasons were many but very soon Europe may be an economic unit
with a single currency and the process may not end there.
I personally would not relish the situation where Britain withdraws
from a Europe which is a social, political, and economic entity. And I
doubt if large international companies would be interested in investing
in a country as small as Britain.
It concerns me that the Euro-sceptics and anti-Europeans seem to be
gaining some clout in the present Government. They seem to represent the
worst side of nationalism, the side that has made recession and
retrogression into an art form in this country.
I wonder what the anti-Europeans intend to use to replace the EU. I
suspect they intend to rebuild the empire.

AS I was the member of Advocates for Animals who took the film of
animal abuse and breaches of the law at Scottish livestock markets, I
must respond to the false and misleading statements made by Willie
Blair, president of the Institute of Auctioneers and Appraisers in
Scotland (February 11).
According to Mr Blair ''the fact that it took several months of
filming to collect this small number of incidents in markets throughout
Scotland . . . confirms our strongly-held belief that such cases are
isolated''. The fact is that out of a total of 33 Scottish animal
auction markets only 11 were visited and in most cases these markets
were visited on only one occasion.
Furthermore, the investigation took five months to complete because of
other work commitments, not least the current public concern over live
exports.
As for Mr Blair's claim that the incidents filmed were ''isolated
cases'', I would remind him that what was shown on TV was only a tiny
fraction extracted from many hours of film.
We have revealed 34 breaches of the regulations governing the
treatment of animals at markets, many of them of a serious nature and
many committed on more than one occasion. Of the 11 markets visited, 10
were abusing animals. Does this indicate that all is well within
Scottish markets? I think not.
As we state in our report: ''This investigation has revealed that the
main legislation governing the treatment of animals at markets is being
breached routinely and that the grossly insensitive handling of calves,
pigs, sheep, and cattle appears commonplace.''

IF someone told me, as I pushed my trolley round the supermarket, that
I personally was responsible for a great deal of human and animal
suffering I would be horrified. Yet it is unfortunately true.
The frozen turkey price wars before Christmas, which we took advantage
of, has resulted in the closure of a fresh turkey processing plant near
Aberdeen with the resultant loss of jobs and long journeys for the
turkeys to the next plant.
How many pig farmers have gone out of business or, worse still, have
to send the pigs on these horrendous journeys across Europe to get a
market because we choose to buy chaper Danish bacon, whose pigs are
reared in conditions banned here so they cannot fairly compete in price?
The cheap chickens we snap up result in birds being made to grow so
quickly that their skeletons don't form properly and their legs
collapse. Battery eggs are cheaper and we choose not to pay a bit extra
to buy eggs from healthy, happy hens.
While there is rightly so much concern at the moment for animal
welfare and the farmers are taking the brunt of the protests, let us not
forget that all this is being done in our name, the great British
consumer.
Until we question where our food comes from, the cruelty will
continue.

HEAD to head, knocking their frontal lobes against each other with
furious and dimwitted abandon, Government policies now resemble nothing
so much as deer in the rutting season. Consider the contradictions this
morning in the aftermath of the Prime Minister's visit to Scotland and
Mr Jonathan Aitken's embarrassing encounter with the truth of what
Scottish businessmen really think. The first clunking absurdity concerns
the collision between the Government's policies towards Europe, where
minimalist involvement and sour and grudging acceptance are the order of
the day, and the growing importance for Scotland of inward investment.
Opening the new NEC plant in Livingston yesterday Mr Major delivered the
opinion that NEC would not be in Livingston, bringing jobs and local
prosperity, if Scotland had devolution. Unfortunately for him the
management of NEC disagree. Making no secret of their amusement, they
reaffirmed that they were there because of the quality of the workforce
and that politics, either current or in the future, would not interfere
with that decision. Just about the only point at which NEC and Mr Major
do connect is in their joint enthusiasm for ignoring EU social policies,
thereby reducing wages, but nobody should be proud of that. The truth is
that multinational companies like NEC don't care whether Scotland is in
federation with England or the moon as long as their basic requirements
are met.
If devolution would not be a problem for inward investors, what would?
The answer to that is the policies of the current British Government
towards Europe. Inward investors such as NEC locate in Scotland for
different reasons, some of which have been mentioned already, and they
are arriving in increasing numbers. Locate in Scotland has recorded well
over 300 inward investment projects in the past five years leading to
the creation or consolidation of nearly 50,000 jobs. A prime motivating
force in all of this is the position of Scotland, and Britain, within
Europe. The vast and lucrative European market is easier to develop from
inside, but inward investors like NEC will disappear like snow in summer
if Britain removes itself from the centre of Europe, or even from Europe
altogether. The confusion, pettiness, and bitterness of the Tory Party's
argument with itself over Europe, and the resulting spillover into
national policy, are exactly the conditions which rattle potential and
existing investors.
It is possible, indeed probable, that Mr Major and his advisers will
ignore the evidence of NEC and certainly disregard the assertions of The
Herald. Who would they believe? Perhaps Tory supporters will suffice.
The Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Mr Jonathan Aitken, was also in
Scotland yesterday. He told businessmen at the Scottish Council forum in
Gleneagles of the success of Scotland in attracting inward investment,
curiously (in the light of the alleged anxiety over constitutional
matters) at a significantly higher rate than the rest of Britain. Like
his leader, Mr Aitken could not resist a little pathetic scaremongering,
suggesting that devolution would scare future inward investors as much
as it scared today's business leaders in Scotland. Appearing remarkably
free of fear, Mr Peter de Vink, a noted businessman and Tory supporter,
told Mr Aitken that the squabbling in the Tory Party over Europe was the
worst way to continue to attract investors. That is the truth of the
matter.
Nor do Tory attitudes do anything for Scottish and British exporters
except, perhaps, inspire real fear. Our economic recovery is led by
exports and the bulk of our exports go to countries which are fellow
members of the European Union. That business will be threatened if
Britain is forced on to a slow European track, or even forced out of
Europe completely, by the blinkered Little Englanders who appear to have
a stranglehold on policy at the moment. All of these factors are much of
a piece with those other head-banging contradictions in which the
Government now specialises. One of the more obvious is the proposal to
give a devolved parliament to Northern Ireland but to deny one to
Scotland. Of course the conditions of Scotland and Northern Ireland are
not similar; politics in Scotland are a good deal more stable than they
are across the water. Yet the stubborn denial and the essential
contradiction remain. Mr Major's pursuit of subsidiarity in Europe, but
the hopelessly twisted way in which subsidiarity is not properly applied
to Scotland, is just another example. Here we have the core of it; the
greatest danger to our prosperity in Scotland is not the threat of
devolution but the policies of the present Government. In comparison the
deer, with their peculiar seasonal rituals, begin to look intelligent.

POOR Waverley. Destined throughout a long life to be always the symbol
of something, be it hidden rocks, nasty weather, or even the nautical
menopause, she now finds herself the token victim in an argument between
two powerful groups who should know better. The Waverley is marooned
upstream of the jammed Bell's Bridge, itself the victim of the floods
which poured down the River Kelvin and into the Clyde last December. It
would seem a simple, though no doubt costly, affair to unjam the bridge,
swing it open and let the Waverley progress downstream for her primping
and painting. The Glasgow Development Agency appears keen to do this and
has a contractor who will carry out the work. The snag is that he needs
access to the north quayside which is owned by the Scottish Exhibition
and Conference Centre, and SECC management will not give the necessary
permission.
All of this is highly convenient for the SECC because its management
do not like the Bell's Bridge, clearly consider that it allows
undesirable (that is, poor and maybe a bit down-at-heel) people to
infiltrate their hallowed precincts and claim that, in any case, the
floods have damaged the quayside to such an extent that it is too
dangerous to allow access to the GDA's contractor. At this point we
should pause and consider the principal combatants in this affair. Both
are large, prosperous organisations accustomed to making things happen,
if largely in their own interests. Both have multi-million-pound plans
to develop their respective sides of the river and it is not
inconceivable that the Bell's Bridge, restored and working, would
provide an attractive link between the two projects. The SECC management
insist that their insurers demand that nobody goes on to the north quay
until permission is given. If the SECC had wanted permission to be given
it would have moved heaven and earth to secure it. This is, in short, a
ridiculous situation in which heads should be banged together to allow a
swift resolution of the plight of both the bridge and the Waverley. They
wouldn't have done it to a gunboat.

TRAGIC. Selfish. Suicidal. These are a few of the words that spring to
my mind when I read about the waste of life taking place in the
mountains of Scotland at this season of the year. My purpose in
mentioning it is to seize upon it as a parable of the profound change
which is taking place in our society and which is leading it into a new
dark age.
The climbers represent freedom at its purest. Freedom to climb very
mountain, raft every river, and enjoy the dream that they are being
truly free. Then the dream becomes a nightmare. They become lost in a
white-out, and because our society believes in protecting people (even
from themselves) a rescue is mounted. Dozens of people are involved.
Helicopters scramble and a painful and dangerous search begins.
Sometimes it ends in tears for a family and sometimes in
congratulations. It always ends with a bill to pay and society until now
has been glad to pick it up.
We have not yet arrived at a situation in which climbers (or their
grieving families) are presented with huge bills, or simply left to fend
for themselves when they get into difficulties. Like me, you are
possibly irritated at the foolhardiness of these climbers but would feel
uncomfortable with either of these solutions. After all, it does not
cost all that much.
My point (and parable) is not concerned with money but with the
tension between freedom and restraint. There has never been more
personal freedom for the average citizen of Scotland (or Ireland for
that matter) than there is today. Freedom to travel at speed and low
cost within our own country and abroad. Freedom to vote, voice
outrageous opinions on phone-in radio, or dance and drink the night away
at a legally-licensed premises and then go shopping on a Sunday. We can
buy magazines which would have landed their publishers in jail a mere
generation ago and watch films with official certificates which would
never have obtained one a few years ago.
Oh yes, there are now more bureaucratic rules about health and safety
at work and more parking meters than once there were. But if we could
conduct a seance with our Victorian forebears, we would soon get the
matter in perspective. Want to return to the good old days of pit ponies
and full employment for all wee boys who wanted a job running up and
down sooty chimneys? We have freedoms they never dreamt of, and we have
them in abundance. So far so good. Now the downside.
We have a system which safeguards these freedoms, and makes it
difficult for someone to take them away. It is therefore open to
exploitation by nasty people and there are always plenty of these. Take
the Graham family of Glenrothes, who terrorised their neighbours. It
took weeks of court proceedings to decide what any sane person would
have regarded as utterly essential -- that they should be evicted. I see
them as a symbol of how the wicked can work the system, using hard-won
freedoms and rights as a kind of oppression of others.
The perfect illustration of this are the anti-motorway and animal
rights groups who will be gathering in George Square today and marching
out to the so-called Pollok Free State. In a society with fewer freedoms
than ours they would simply be herded into a prison camp. Instead they
threaten to bankrupt police forces whose budgets are blown sky-high in
deploying hundreds of officers to contain the confrontations engineered
by these people.
The madcap disease is not confined to our borders, as we have seen
this week with the closure of the cross-Channel ferry routes by French
seamen.
Not long ago we saw Islamic fundamentalists using our society's
freedoms to burn The Satanic Verses, as was their right. But then came
the fatwa, a clear incitement to murder. Now we see the same fanatical
forces chanting hysterically for the death of a boy for blasphemy even
after he has been found innocent on appeal.
I used to think that such outbursts were the product of societies
which were a few hundred years behind our own in their appreciation of
freedom and restraint. Now I am not so sure. Perhaps such anarchic
forces are always lurking, ready to be exploited by rabblerousers, and
ready to exploit freedom. Perhaps the human animal has evolved
sufficiently to conceive of freedom but not enough to exercise it
responsibly.
Unless this trend abates, we are going to see a terrible reaction.
Anarchy will be suppressed but freedom will pay the price -- and we will
all be the losers.
A greater prophet than I envisaged a holy mountain which all nations
would revere, turning their swords into ploughshares, their spears into
pruning hooks. But I see a mountain upon which there is the clash of
swords. The environmentalists fighting the foresters; the animal rights
protesters fighting the gamekeepers; the quarrymen fending off the
hillwalkers.
It is a bleak prospect, and when the blizzard of hostility intensifies
it may lead to the mountain being declared out of bounds for those who
want to exercise their freedom upon it. The clouds may descend and cover
the mountain, and we will be left wondering whether it only exists in
our imagination, for we will see it no longer and walk upon it,
breathing freedom no more.

AS practices go, Andrew Davies's latest is a very peculiar one indeed.
Not content with being one of Britain's most distinguished and outspoken
dramatists, he is preparing to sail into uncharted waters this week with
his first stab at scripting a television sitcom.
On the face of it, there is nothing particularly unusual about Game On
(BBC2, Monday). It would appear to be a pretty standard, formulaic,
South of England comedy series about two trendy and single young blokes
sharing a flat with a dishy blonde secretary. The classic, uninspiring,
killing field of a score of tired sitcoms over the years.
But Davies is the man who brought such delights as House of Cards,
Middlemarch, Mother Love, The Old Devils, Anglo-Saxon Attitudes, and A
Very Peculiar Practice to the small screen. So surely Game On must be at
least a little bit special? Well, it is.
Not to put too fine a point on it, the series is about sex. Or rather
the lack of it. The three characters (played by Ben Chaplin, Matthew
Cottle, and Samantha Janus) are post-yuppie, un-Filofaxed, and
unattached young adults who seem to have everything going for them. The
problem is that they can't get laid.
Speaking from his home in Warwickshire, Davies explained: ''Older
people imagine that youngsters in their twenties have a wonderful
carefree life. What we wanted to put over was the fact that it can
actually be quite a miserable and very anxious time of life. Most people
in their twenties have quite disastrous sex lives. They spend their time
just waiting for someone decent to come along. And, in the series, the
three characters just get on each others' tits.''
What makes Game On different from other sitcoms is the frankness of
the treatment and the explicitness of the dialogue. Davies and co-writer
Bernadette Davis set out to challenge the accepted limits of what you
can do in the standard popular sitcom format.
''Sitcoms always seem to shy nervously away from sex as soon as they
get anywhere near it. We were very emphatic about the use of language.
We felt that the way people talk in most sitcoms is nothing like the way
people talk in real life,'' he added.
This is presumably why the word ''shag'' crops up time and again in
the script.
''Yes,'' said Davies. ''I quite like the word 'shag'. It's a word I
used when I was young but it seemed to disappear for 20 years. It's
certainly a much friendlier word than the awful 'bonk'.''
The idea for the series really came from Bernadette Davis. She was an
assistant with Davies's London agent and she used to amuse the writer
with horrific tales about her own flat-sharing situation.
''I knew she wanted to be a writer and I told her that this was
wonderful material which could be turned into something which she could
make some money from. She was unsure about how to go about it and I
agreed to write it with her. We did a stage version first and submitted
it to various fringe companies but we didn't get any takers. They said
it was funny but that it didn't go anywhere; it didn't have any dramatic
development,'' said Davies.
However, the writer was then approached by the independent production
company Hat Trick, who asked him if he fancied writing a sitcom. ''And
so the vices became virtues. In a sitcom you don't want the basic
situation to change. You want variations on a theme. So we wrote six
episodes,'' he explained.
Was this then a classic rage against the dying of the light for the
58-year-old writer?
''In a way you could say that about a lot of the things I write. It's
nice to feel that you're starting off in a new form and learning
something and writing for a young audience. It is enormously
heartwarming to be mixing with a young cast who are great fun and very
inventive,'' he said.
Davies, who made a celebrated attack on the hierarchy of both ITV and
BBC when he delivered the Huw Wheldon Lecture earlier this year, was
described in a recent newspaper article as the new enfant terrible of
British television drama. Since the death of Dennis Potter he had become
the heir apparent to the mantle of the nation's most controversial
screen writer. Was this a tag with which he was comfortable?
''Well, I'm a bit old to be an enfant terrible. But in a sense I don't
mind that kind of thing. The climate of nervousness among television
producers and writers at the moment makes it very difficult for them to
speak out. People like me, who are in the position of not having to
worry too much about getting employment, have a kind of duty to say what
we think is wrong with things. We have to start the debate and stir
people up a bit,'' he said.
The writer feels strongly that, in television today, creativity is
stifled by a bureaucratic system which insists that every programme idea
is ''referred upwards'' to someone else.
''What it leads to is people not saying 'I'm doing this because I
think it's a brilliant idea' but instead trying to second-guess what,
say, Alan Yentob is going to want. The situation seems to be even worse
in ITV where everything has to go through this network centre,'' he
explained.
However, Davies admits that he is at last seeing some encouraging
signs of change. ''I've got two serials in development which are going
through the process at ITV. One of them is an aout a woman who turns
into a werewolf. It's nice to see ideas which don't involve either
policemen or doctors being considered for a change,'' he added.
MIKE Emilianow is the type of seedy New York private eye you would
never get tired smacking in the face with a baseball bat. To judge by
next week's Modern Times documentary, Cheating Hearts (Wednesday, BBC2),
he is the sleazebag to beat all sleazebags.
Mike's clients are usually vulnerable and suspicious women who pay him
copious amounts of dollar bills to set honey-traps for their
husbands/partners/lovers. His modus operandi is to employ beautiful
young seductresses (usually bimbo models or exotic dancers), wire them
up, and send them out to place temptation in the way of unsuspecting
males. It comes as no great surprise to learn that 99% of all men fail
Emilianow's test.
All he's doing, he claims, is fighting crimes of the heart -- and
providing ''a vital social service'' in the process. Actually, all he
does is prey upon the emotions of some very sad people.
''I'm saving these women time. They're seeing what it's going to be
like two or three years down the line,'' he remarks, defensively.
The man is a snake. The most telling moments in this highly watchable
documentary is when the camera follows him into a low-life strip bar and
watches him creep his way into the showgirls' company. He is, he boasts,
dating five or six different women at the one time. Is this not a tad
hypocritical for a man committed to exposing love cheats?
''The difference between me and other men is that they're in so-called
stable relationships and cheating on the side. I'm up front with the
women I'm involved with. They know there's no emotional attachment,'' he
explains. This gumshoe wouldn't know emotion if it bit him on the nose.
SCOTTISH Television takes a gamble tomorrow night with a distinct
change of pace, style, and format to the first post-Taggart Taggart.
Gone, of course, is Mark McManus but gone too are the now familiar 101
suspects-an-episode. Indeed, within the first 20 minutes of Black Orchid
(a two-hour special transmitted on Sunday) you are pretty sure about the
identity of the villain. This makes for a refreshingly straightforward
storyline, free of character complications, but leaves the way open for
a delicious denouement.
The big question, of course, is can the series survive without the
eponymous detective? And the answer to that lies, not so much in the
narrative (which, let's face it, has always been contrived) but in the
strengths or weaknesses of the principal actors, James Macpherson and
Blythe Duff. The jury, I suspect, will still be out after this.
Black Orchid, penned appropriately by Taggart creator Glenn Chandler,
is a reworking of the old Svengali story. A bizarre series of
executions, all of which appear to be somehow connected with stage
hypnotist Tony Sabina (Robert Robertson), lead Maryhill CID's finest to
speculate whether or not a person can be entranced into committing
murder.

IN a huge loft in New York's bustling Soho, Kim Johnson Gross and Jeff
Stone preside over their Chic Simple empire. Kim and Jeff's ''laboratory
and workshop'' is a busy, computer-filled room dominated by Jeff's
surfboard and a huge pinboard where clippings, Polaroids, Post-It notes,
and scrawled lists and reminders jostle for position. Kim describes
herself and partner Jeff as ''a couple of laid-back control freaks.''
Together with a team of eight, Kim and Jeff devise the Chic Simple
range of books which cover everything: from paint, the nursery, homes,
luggage, tools, and storage to spectacles and scarves. The books are
beautifully designed with witty quotes and all sorts of handy advice
(keep bicycles off the floor on a wall rack -- they will be less likely
to be tripped over and the tyres will last longer). ''It's like age-old
wisdom, pared down and packaged for the nineties,'' says Kim.
Chic Simple's Zen-like design doctrine is quite at odds with the
glossy spreads of other people's homes in the interiors magazines. ''Our
philosophy is not how to live like someone else but how to live the way
you want to live. In the past most interior design books have shown you
everybody else's room -- and that's valid -- but it can be overwhelming
because you might not have that much money or a room that happens to
look over the ocean. It's easy to get discouraged,'' says Jeff.
''There's been a change in interior decoration,'' adds Kim who began
her career as a model before becoming fashion editor on top magazines
like Esquire. ''Once a decorator would dictate everything. They would
place every little trinket just so. In the end it seemed as though
people didn't really dwell in these homes, it was just the designer's
showcase. You have to look at your space and think about the way you
live and how to make it comfortable. Today people are much more
independent and from a style point of view much more literate and have
more of a design vocabulary,'' says Jeff who formerly worked in
publishing.
''It's one thing to know about the furniture it's another to know how
to work with the space and how to place the furniture within it. We try
to cut through all the noise and clutter. People only have so much money
so it's important to understand how to spend the money to get the
effects you want.'' The Chic Simple series was born in 1991 and hailed
as being part of ''the more you know, the less you need'' philosophy.
Chic Simple's credo of simplicity with style, economy, and ecology is
just right for the nervous nineties. These are a new kind of style book,
''heralding a change in attitude to design,'' enthused Elle Decoration
magazine recently.
Since the early days Chic Simple was a success. The books first sold
out in the US and Britain and then the Japanese took them to their
hearts (despite the fact that the books were written in English).
''Their clean design is appealing to the Japanese. Also the way the
information is packaged and is easily accessible,'' says Kim. Now you
can buy Chic Simple books all over Japan, even in railway kiosks. The
Chic Simple books are sold in Muji shops both in Japan and the UK and
both shops and books reflect each other's devotion to well-designed
basic products.
The small-format books have been dubbed ''tools for living, and have
been designed to enable the reader to get all the information they need.
The little volumes can also be carried around, fitting into a back
pocket. Already ther is a Chic Simple label on shirts, trousers, and
tote bags (sold on an American TV shopping channel) that's destined for
the UK. Kim and Jeff also confess to plans afoot that will enlarge the
merchandise range and even see a Chic Simple chain of shops which may
yet rival Benetton and The Gap.
The Chic Simple duo also have a vision to create what they call ''a
cyberspace general store'' using modern technology like CD-Rom and the
Internet. Already they receive e-mail requests and suggestions from Chic
Simple fans worldwide who think of Chic Simple as being about their
lives.
''That's what we're most proud of. It's not just about what Kim and
Jeff think, it's how people have taken these books and made them their
own,'' says Jeff. ''We have empowered people.''
* The latest Chic Simple books include Tools, Nursery, Storage and
Desk which cost #7.95 each and the larger format Body, #14.95, all are
published by Thames &amp; Hudson. Chic Simple's e-mail

OUTSIDER / Ian Hamilton QC
THERE are some things that are common to the law of every civilised
country. One of these is that the criminal law and all its procedures
should be simple enough to be known to every citizen. It is a corollary
to this proposition that lawyers should know the law so that they can
advise their clients. That's why law students sit exams.
It was therefore very startling on February 11 when we read in our
newspapers that the Lord Justice-General, Lord Hope, sitting with two
other judges, had apparently made important changes to the rules
governing the admission of new evidence before the Court of Appeal.
Most lawyers, prior to the publication of the decision in that case,
would have told their client that on the facts stated there were no
grounds of appeal. They would have been wrong. Apparently, and unknown
to everyone, the law had been changed. It had been changed overnight in
the Lord Justice-General's head, and none of us knew. More careful
lawyers might say that the law had been restated. Whatever the words
used, people who have been wrongly convicted were suddenly given hope.
The law had changed.
But had it? Maybe yes. Maybe no. A week after Lord Hope's court
decided the matter, a similar case came before Lord Ross, the Lord
Justice-Clerk, and two other judges. Lord Ross doubted the correctness
of Lord Hope's decision, and sent the second case for further
consideration to a bench of five judges. The five judges may come up
with yet another answer . . . or they may not. Who knows? It must surely
be the first time in the whole history of jurisprudence that an Appeal
Court has been in public dispute over its own powers.
Several questions must be asked. The first is: do these people who
thought that they had a right of appeal, have one or not? To that
question even the brightest of lawyers can only raise eyes to the
ceiling and say: ''If the Lord Justice-General and the Lord
Justice-Clerk don't agree, then probably the Almighty Himself has the
matter at avizandum''.
The next question must be: what is the will of the people on this
important matter? I have long asserted that we live under an oligarchy,
and that the will of the Scottish people doesn't count. However, since
every other country in the Western world, even England, has an effective
Appeal Court, it is not unreasonable to think that we should have one in
Scotland too. At present our Appeal Court is so limited in its scope
that it cannot declare a jury's verdict ''unsafe and unsound''.
The assumption has always been that when you come north over the Tweed
you are among a people so bright and intelligent that they never allow a
miscarriage of justice to happen in the first place. This is a manifest
absurdity. Juries can be just as stupid here as anywhere else, as was
shown a day or two ago when a jury let a foreman return a verdict of not
proven although the majority of them had voted for guilty. To correct
perverse stupidities like that, and many others, we must have an Appeal
Court with wider powers than those at present exercised.
The trouble has arisen because many lawyers, including some judges,
think that the Appeal Court already has these wide powers if only the
gentlemen sitting there would go a little further and try to make the
system work. Scots law is the only system in the world which does not
have its own legislature to correct it when it gets its wig in a twist.
Indeed the whole present muddle has arisen because attempts are being
made by the judiciary in a push-me-pull-me effort to get the engine back
on the rails before the Westminster Parliament steps in and gets its
clumsy hands on the whole issue. There is, of course, a committee set up
by the Secretary of State to consider the matter. When was there not?
Meanwhile several dozen people (no-one knows the correct number), who
should never have been convicted in the first place, stay in prison
wondering what the law is and no-one can tell them. And we call this a
civilised country.
The matter does not end there and with some hesitation I make further
comment. Even although he has been quoted as saying, ''If I am
criticised that is all part of the job'', I am not going to criticise
Lord Hope. Old habits of reticence die hard. I just wonder what I and a
hundred other lawyers are supposed to do when we read that he has been
on Radio Scotland talking about the functioning of the Appeal Court.
Any statements by the highest judges in the land are taken extremely
seriously by us people who do the day-to-day work of the courts and make
the whole system function. I wonder, without criticising his Lordship,
why, if he was going to break with tradition and make statements to the
media, he chose sound radio, the most ephemeral of all channels to do
so. It is unusual for a jurist to come down from the mountain with
tablets of air. I wonder what he said. As a Queen's Counsel I feel I
ought to know, but I doubt if I ever will.
Where then does the law stand? The poor student who has to answer that
question might earn a cuff on the ear for saying that in Scotland the
High Court of Criminal Appeal makes up the law as it goes along. I hope
for the sake of justice it will not be too violent a blow.

<HEADLINE>#5m plan for Logie Baird centre at the Briggait</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>979681468</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A #5M project is under way to set up a centre commemorating John Logie
Baird at the empty Briggait building in the heart of Glasgow.
It reverts to district council control next month and will be made
available for conversion into a centre dedicated to the television
genius. A survey has revealed it could achieve more than 350,000
visitors a year.
Councillors yesterday gave approval for immediate negotiations to take
place with the John Logie Baird Trust.
The trust has already prepared business plans. Its professional
advisers believe the project will attract #2.25m of European Regional
Development Funding providing there is matching input.
They believe this balance could come from the Millennium Fund or from
a package of alternative local sources.
A report drawn up by council officials told councillors: ''The
proposed centre will have as its central theme 'television -- past,
present and future'. It would promote the science of televisual
technology and offer a unique educational experience in sight and sound
depicting major televised events and technological developments.''

THE PRIME Minister yesterday told Scottish Conservative candidates and
party activists that it was time for the party to get up off its knees
and start taking the fight to the opposition.
The private lunch was attended by 450 of the party faithful at New
Lanark heritage village and they gave Mr John Major an enthusiastic
response, when he laid into Tory Euro-rebels, saying they seemed more
interested in waging internal war than turning their guns on Labour.
He pointed out that the rebel MPs had only been elected to Parliament
thanks to the hard work of party activists.
''There was huge support from the audience for that point,'' said Mr
Arthur Bell, one of Mr Major's hosts for the day.
Mr Bell, the chairman of the Scottish Tory Reform Group, the liberal
wing of the party which, ironically, in view of the Prime Minister's new
ultra-Unionist stance, is most open to devolution.
Throughout the day, Mr Major continued to deny that his plan for a
Northern Ireland Assembly showed that devolution for Scotland could be
achieved within the Union.
Speaking on BBC radio, he said that the comparison was ''stupid and
illogical'', and he insisted that higher taxes and the break-up of the
UK would be the result.
Mr Major told the party workers: ''For the first time in generations,
Scots are coming back to Scotland instead of leaving it because of
changed economic circumstances.
''Go out and take the credit for all the things that have gone right
in the last 16 years. It is time for the Conservative Party to get up
off its knees and start fighting.''
Explaining why he would be taking the lead in next week's debate, he
said: ''I will make it absolutely clear what our European policy is
today, tomorrow, and the long-term future.
''I intend to say to every Conservative MP, that is our policy and I
expect you to be in our lobby, supporting our policy. I will expect them
to be in the lobby supporting us, not out on College Green squabbling.''
Reporters questioned how appropriate the meeting place was, given that
the nineteenth century model industrial community pioneered by Robert
Owen was considered one of the cradles of socialism and the co-operative
movement.
However, Mr Bell, who is vice-chairman of the village conservation
trust and chairman of its housing association, said: ''That is a common
misconception. Owen was a very successful capitalist who was a supporter
of Lord Liverpool's Conservative Government.''

ONE of the most important messages of fashion trends this spring is
that what goes on underneath is as critical as is what is happening on
top. The curvy, nipped-waist suits, which are making a big comeback,
lamentably beg for serious upholstery to support this vintage hour-glass
silhouette. Padded and pointy bras, girdles and control panties
endeavour to lift, pull, and manipulate the beanpole figure into a mass
of tortuous curves. Frankly, however, regardless of these designer
diktats about shape, not everyone harbours such masochistic tendencies.
The flip side to the revival of structured silhouettes is a deluge of
bias-cut sheaths and clingy halterneck dresses that would reveal every
lump and bump of padding and seaming that suspenders and a corsette
could muster. Fine fabrics that slip, slither, and hug every natural
curve demand a far subtler approach to figure control.
Few of us have the figures that would benefit from such close
scrutiny. Fortunately, Marks &amp; Spencer has found the answer to the
dilemma -- and is test-marketing the solution in its main Glasgow branch
from March 1. It is launching a range of underwear to give support and
coverage however sheer and clingy your dress is on top.
Bodyshades provide a smooth, opaque outline under clothing with no
tell-tale seaming to suggest there is anything between you and that slip
of dress fabric. The underwired bras (#10) are pre-moulded to dispense
with seams while modern manufacturing techniques combined with a
lycra-blended fabric mean the lightweight body (#11) offers stretch and
support without fanfare. The pale pastel shades for spring through to
the white and transparents of high summer, however, require considerable
discretion from underpinnings. Marks &amp; Spencer, therefore, has produced
the underwear in three opaque, skintone shades; beige, toffee, and cocoa
for total concealment. The body and briefs -- high-cut leg (#4) and
thong (#3.50) -- come in sizes 8 to 18, while the bra is 34 to 36A, 34
to 38B,C, and D.

* SOAPS have had a bad press recently. Unlike cleansing bars, gels,
and lotions, which protect the acid and alkaline balance of the skin,
the highly alkaline base of the average soap strips it bare. Detergents
used in some soap and most bubble baths are even worse for the skin, but
at least we don't use them on our face.
Using a tiny amount of pH-balanced shampoo plus oils like almond or
jojoba is probably best for the bath if you have sensitive skin and are
addicted to bubbles.
Most of us still want to use soap in the bath and fortunately the
latest soap formulae are less harsh than they were. Unless you are
particularly sensitive the body can cope with a little perfume. Everyone
from Tesco to Boots and Body Shop is selling the latest vegetable, fruit
and essential oils-based pH-balanced creations, but the haute couture
houses are competing with exotic shapes and scents.
Starring roles in this current soap opera have gone to the lively
designer companies who have had so much success in the perfume world
over the last 10 years. ''Women started buying perfume because they
couldn't afford the clothes. Now they are buying designer soaps and a
handbag size perfume,'' one cheery House of Fraser cosmetic salesgirl
informed me.
Soap is, of course, the first step in the stylish concept of basic
layering, followed by bath gels, oils, body lotion, shampoos in a few
cases, and a final spray of perfume. This does not need to cost a
fortune -- Tesco offers a layering package in its aromatherapy-based
Moods range for under 10.
Sleek items like Issey Miyake's fruity-sweet melon-scented bar,
turquoise and elegant in its transparent presentation box (#17 in the
box, #8 for a smaller 5oz bar), usually contain enough designer perfume,
around 4%, to create a lingering effect on the skin even without
layering. Most are processed so that they are triple concentrated, three
times as solid as ordinary soap. ''They are super fatted when they are
condensed from the boiling process,'' an Aramis salesgirl explained.
''But, then, I've still had people come back and complain a bar hasn't
lasted for months. You find that they have left it lying under the water
in the bath. You do have to be sensible.''
Up there with Miyake in the designer glam stakes are heavily-scented
soaps like Jean Paul Gaultier (#17, with the Madonna-inspired corsetted
body sculpted within the pink shape); Claud Montana (#15, egg-shaped,
designed to sit on the side of the bath); and Giorgio (#11 and a pretty
fan shape).
More Neighbours on a night out than seriously flash are florals such
as the elegant Madame Rochas (#12, pearl-shaped in a white dish); Dior's
Tendre Poison (#10, definitely less brash than Poison in terms of scent
but bright green); Kenzo (#16.50, turquoise with a pleated effect and
the traditional leaf motif); Pierre Balmain's citrosy Vent Vert (#17,
cream coloured with fern motif); and Betty Barclay (#7.95, white with
fan effect in a red and black box).

MARLON BRANDO would have been impressed. In his 1954 dockside movie On
the Waterfront, the young hero poignantly declared: ''I coulda been a
contender.''
This waterfront property must be a contender for the best view in
Glasgow. For many years, as its docks and shipbuilding activities
dwindled, Glasgow turned its back on the river which had brought wealth
and prestige.
Now the riverbanks have been cleared and new housing opportunities
opened up. Where there used to be rotting warehouses, now there are
upmarket waterfront residences in attractive developments.
Flat 7 at 73 Lancefield Quay, on the north side of the Clyde just west
of the Broomielaw has a conservatory and balcony perched above the
river.
The 25ft-long lounge/dining room which opens directly from the
conservatory, and there are two double bedrooms (one with en-suite
shower room), a fitted kitchen with a full range of appliances, and
family bathroom. With the exception of the kitchen, all of the rooms
overlook the Clyde.
The property has security entry, gas central heating, double glazing,
and two secure parking spaces.
In On The Waterfront, Brando also said: ''I coulda had class''. This
touch of waterfront class is being offered by Slater Hogg &amp; Howison's
city centre office at offers over #92,000.

We should be enjoying rather than enduring the record rainfall, or so
thinks John Linklater
KEEP falling on my head. The song was quite right about raindrops. New
Scientist confirmed this recently. It posed the question: If I run home
from the bus stop through the rain will I get less wet than if I walk?
The answer was ''no'', except for the crown of the head.
The number of raindrops falling on your head is proportional to the
time it remains exposed. Running reduces the number. But the equation
was more complex, and readers of the learned journal were still advised
that walking was preferable. This was because running reduced the time
for normal evaporation of rain on your coat. You ended up wetter.
Otherwise, the number of raindrops swept up by the body was the same.
This is because the volume of space between the bus stop and your front
door was unchanged by running or walking. It was just the top of the
head that made any difference. Raindrops kept falling on it. It was best
to get your head home quickly.
Singing in the rain is different. In the musical everyone will recall
that Gene Kelly is wearing a hat. This has got little to do with
protecting the crown of his head from precipitation, because quite
frankly the man has neglected to take the most direct route from bus
stop to front door. He doubles back and forward. Does skiddies in the
street. Skites in the gutter. And dances up a lamp-post. The point is,
Gene Kelly is enjoying himself.
He is an example to us all, and it doesn't matter that he is evidently
in love, because he is also in love with the rain. That is a talent, and
we, of all people, should observe it. Especially in the West of Scotland
where, according to the most recent Scottish Environment annual
statistics, we had 231 days of rain in the year. An accommodation is
needed between us and the rain, because it is going to keep falling on
our heads.
We can't fight the stuff, walking or running. The winter rainfall,
recorded at Glasgow Airport from December, is already the highest since
records there began in 1921. The fall was 524mm up to February 22,
exceeding the previous highest level to the end of February of 509mm in
1989/90. This is no fluke. There has been a consistent trend of annual
rainfall increases since the earliest Scottish records of the 1860s.
Instead of getting indignant, demanding to know why it is happening,
all that global warming hysteria and acid rain, we should accept the
situation. When someone else's rain, rain does go away, it will fall
somewhere else. Probably on us. The rain in Spain now falls mainly on
Luxembourg, apparently. The climatologists report that there is a
definite trend towards higher rainfall in northern latitudes, so we're
not going to escape. We should just learn to get out there and enjoy it.
Now, ask the New Scientist about this scenario. You come out of your
front door. The bus stop is at the end of the street and it's plowtering
down. You pass a complete stranger. And, of course, you exchange rueful
grimaces. One of you says: ''That's the rain on, then.'' Or ''Great day
for the ducks''. Or the ironic approach: ''Lovely weather, again.''
Scottish rain is a great catalyst of social exchange. It induces
immediate solidarity among people who have no other connection with each
other. As an agent of gregariousness, even if it's to indulge in mutual
grumbling, it has shaped the Scottish character.
Contrast that with the South of England commuter; grim,
umbrella-accessoried, immersed in his or her private despondency, never
meeting eyes with anyone, sheltered from the worst elements but exposed
to a terrible solitariness. Miserable weather is better than miserable
folk.
Look in the Scots Thesaurus and you will find 14 columns dealing with
wind and storm; rain, mist, snow, and frost; thunder and lightning.
Adversity has invented a rich vocabulary, precisely because folk have
insisted on engaging each other in conversation about it, in every
regional dialect of Scots. There is a wonderful onomatopoeia at work, as
Scots have clearly sought to out-do the remorselessness of the blash
(Banff), the dag (Caithness), the dawk (Fife), the muggle (Aberdeen),
the scour (Dumfries) or the skarrach (Angus).
This vocabulary makes an evaluation of the texture of different fat
smuirs, wet sowps, light mizzles, thin smirrs and thunderous spates,
descending in a variety of densities and wind-driven trajectories to
offer us the opportunity to become world connoisseurs of rain. Our rains
even have different tastes. Some are salty, like brine. Some are fresh,
like pine. Some are harsh, like metal. You can almost feel the
difference on your face between a spitter and spleiter, a skite and a
smuchter. No people could have invented such a sibilance of rain sounds
without also implying a grudging tribute. We might even like it.
The unpredictability of our rain is greatly admired by visitors. We
can do five different kinds of shower, throw in hail, sleet and snow,
intersperse it with glowering clouds, rainbows and our unique cold sun,
all in the space of a single February afternoon. Southern Europeans,
jaded with the monotony of reliably blue skies, recognise in all of this
an explanation for our unpredictable moods, our swings from animation to
introspection, aggression to sweetness and light. Rain saves us from the
natural indolence of the Latins. Insecurity is our lucky stimulus.
''I Can't Stand The Rain,'' sang Ann Peebles, who was no Scot. No real
Borderer, particularly a farmer, would endorse that position. Rain never
intervened to call a halt to that passion of the Borders, a game of
rugby, and its players never look happier than when they are slithering
through the churned-up field, half men, half mud dwellers. It is only in
cricket that rain stops play, and even if that's not true it is a decent
enough lie. It is the floodlights that get short-circuited at football
grounds, though Dumbarton's Boghead is a law unto itself. Well, all
right, so is Morton's Cappielow. If you insist, we have had a lot of
football games cancelled this winter through rain, but it is only the
Americans who say they'll take a rain check when the baseball gets
flooded out. We just hand out the yellow cagoules and get on with it.
These people with all that raining in their hearts are wimps. There is
no more bracing challenge than turning up your collar to the wind and
rain, trying to look unconcerned. Trying to look unimpressed, like James
Dean in his flapping coat, drenched fag hanging out of an unquivering
lip. A hard rain maybe gonna fall. You can hardly not listen to the
rhythm of the falling rain. It's pissing on your parade. It's another
rainy night in Georgia. But you're out there with Tom Waits and all the
other raindogs, 'cause you're a raindog too.

0RED Dwarf star Craig Charles demanded police carry out scientific
tests to prove he had not led a drug-fuelled gang rape of a former Soho
nightclub dancer, a court was told yesterday.
The 30-year-old TV comedian told officers who arrived at his house to
arrest him that the allegations against him were ''malicious and
groundless''.
Detective Constable David Barnfather said the Liverpool-born actor had
immediately begun ''to strongly protest'' his innocence.
''He was pacing up and down. He was talking continuously . . . very
rapidly,'' he told Southwark Crown Court.
Questioned by Jeremy Carter-Manning, QC, the officer said Mr Charles
agreed he had gone to the woman's flat in Clapham, south London, earlier
that day but had only been there for half-an-hour.
''He said no sex had taken place, that only his friend Jack had been
there and no-one else.''
DC Barnfather told the jury that a sniffer dog was used to search the
actor's home for drugs, but all that was recovered was a small piece of
cannabis which Mr Charles handed to him from a table.
Cross-examined by Stephen Solley, QC, defending, the officer agreed
that Mr Charles had been ''very wound up . . . very upset'' about the
allegations.
He also agreed that the actor was very keen that genetic
fingerprinting be carried out to prove that the woman's claims were
''rubbish''.
Detective Sergeant Jon Prentice described how Mr Charles's
co-defendant, company director John Peploe, 36, arrived at the actor's
home in Tyers Street, Kennington, south London, while Mr Charles was
being arrested.
Told he too was being detained for rape, the businessman replied: ''I
can tell you it did not happen. There was no rape.''
He agreed with defence counsel Jill Evans that when they later
returned to his home in Keswick House, Crawford Road, Camberwell, south
London, he told his wife to co-operate with police in providing clothing
he had worn while at the alleged victim's flat earlier that day.
He also told the court that when the men were interviewed the next
day, they exercised their right to silence.
The only thing Mr Peploe said was that he and Mr Charles had been at a
central London restaurant the night before to celebrate the birthday of
the actor's girlfriend.
Both men deny a joint charge of rape and four joint counts of indecent
assault on July 8, 1994.
The woman, who claims she was attacked by the pair and a third man,
who has never been traced, said she was put through a ''nightmarish''
ordeal that lasted several hours.
She said that Mr Charles -- who plays curry-loving David Lister, the
last human in the Universe in the BBC2 science fiction cult comedy
series -- first encouraged one of his friends to rape her.
She told the court she was forced to have oral sex with Mr Charles and
Mr Peploe and was sexually abused.
The trial continues.

A ROW broke out yesterday over the involvement, or lack of it, of the
private sector in the provision of community care in Scotland.
The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities was angered by a report
on the issue from the Scottish Council for Independent Care, the
umbrella organisation for nursing and residential home associations.
The study claimed the private sector was being excluded from community
care planning.
Cosla's social work committee, meeting in Edinburgh, claimed the
report was inaccurate and decided to withdraw from joint talks with the
Scottish Office Social Work Services Group and the private sector.
It demanded an apology. SCIC refused and defended its report.
The study, Closing the Door on the Private Sector, claimed community
care had gone wrong in Scotland because the local authorities were not
implementing the policy the way the Government intended.
In turn, the Government had starved the local authorities of cash and
had failed to bring some authorities into line.
There was a bias against the private sector, the report said. Most
clients needing residential care were being placed in local authority
homes, which could cost up to #440 per week.
They were being preferred to private homes, which cost about half the
price. There was a lack of real choice.
The report had been sent to Lord Fraser of Carmyllie, Scottish Health
and Social Work Minister; MPs; and social work directors.
At the committee meeting, the convener, Councillor Harry Brown of
Central region, said statistics produced regularly by the social work
services group showed clearly SCIC's assertion was wrong.
He said the report undermined serious efforts being made by social
work authorities to implement community care legislation against an
acknowledged background of underfunding.
''The report's language is emotive and offensive and many of its
conclusions require to be refuted as strongly as possible,'' he said.
Councillor James Mudie, Tayside, called the report ''an appalling
piece of work''.
Mr Nigel Wanless, SCIC convener and chairman of the registered nursing
home association in Scotland, said Cosla's reaction was disappointing
and confirmed a lack of will by the local authorities.
The joint meetings to review the development of community care,
originally held quarterly, were now held barely twice a year because
social work directors claimed they had a heavy workload from local
government reorganisation, he said.
SCIC represents between 400 and 500 care homes. It covers the
registered nursing home association, the association of care home
owners, the independent health care association, and the British
federation of care home proprietors.

THE rail union RMT yesterday failed in its High Court bid to outlaw
Government plans to privatise Railtrack.
However, it did win assurances that the Government would retain powers
to regulate and control Railtrack after privatisation and Mr Justice
Dyson went so far as to suggest further applications for judicial review
if the Government was seen to be failing in this role.
RMT general secretary, Mr Jimmy Knapp, said that much had been gained
by forcing the Goverment to admit it would retain much control over the
running of the rail system.
He said this would be of great assistance to an incoming Labour
Government and place a ''ticking timebomb'' under Tory privatisation
plans. It was ''a clear indication that the shareholders of Railtrack
ain't going to get it their own way''.
RMT was refused permission to apply for court orders quashing the
decision of Transport Secretary Brian Mawhinney to privatise Railtrack,
the body now responsible for track, signalling, and stations.
Lawyers for the union, which has more than 45,000 members employed on
the rail network -- 4500 employed by Railtrack -- were seeking judicial
review on the grounds the Government had acted outside its powers,
contrary to domestic and European law.
However, Mr Justice Dyson ruled the Government had not acted
unlawfully and there was no arguable case to go to a full hearing. He
ordered the union to pay the Secretary of State's legal costs.
Mr Patrick Elias, QC, for the RMT, said the union believed development
of the railway infrastructure would be better assured if it remained in
public hands.
He added the decision to sell Railtrack shares by way of a stock
market flotation next year was in breach of a 1991 European transport
development policy directive. This required a ''clear power'' existed
for a government to control their railway infrastructure development in
a way compatible with the needs of the European community.
However, the judge ruled the Government had retained sufficient powers
to enable it to take the necessary steps for the development of the
Railtrack infrastructure.

THE Treasury Chief Secretary, Mr Jonathan Aitken, joined in the
attacks on devolution yesterday, claiming it was an ''expensive
self-indulgence'' which would block Scotland's competitiveness and
growth in jobs.
He also insisted there was no parallel between Scotland and Northern
Ireland, and that the reasons for devolution in Ireland did not apply in
Scotland.
Taking the same line as the Prime Minister, Mr Aitken hinted that a
Scottish Parliament would have to raise substantially more taxes in
Scotland, as the UK Treasury would reduce its spending north of the
Border, and that in itself would seriously damage Scotland's businesses.
Speaking in Scotland on the same day as Mr Major, his speech
underlined the fact that Ministers are taking a common line in decrying
devolution as something which would cost Scottish taxpayers a great deal
of money. Nor is there any suggestion that Ministers will accept the
argument that devolution in Ulster means concessions have to be made in
Scotland.
Speaking at the Scottish Council Development and Industry's forum in
Gleneagles yesterday, which debated changes in employment, Mr Aitken
argued that Scotland's impressive record on inward investment was
significantly due to the financial and economic security that the Union
brought.
He pointed out that identifiable public expenditure per head in
Scotland was 16% higher than the rest of the UK, and that while there
was nothing wrong with that, it should not be forgotten in the current
devolution debate.
''Something else that should not be lost sight of is the potential
deterrent effect to this economy of a tax-raising Scottish Parliament.
It would scare away many of tomorrow's inward investors just as much as
it scares many of today's business leaders in Scotland,'' he continued.
''A devolved or independent Scotland no longer underpinned by the
present UK public expenditure formula would have to raise extra taxation
on a scale which could seriously damage Scotland's competitive position.
''Turning on the local taxation powers of a Scottish parliament would
surely turn off both domestic and international investors and turn up
the costs of Scottish jobs, Scottish production and Scottish exports.''
On Ireland, Mr Aitken claimed that the constitutional positions of
Ulster and Scotland were so different that no meaningful comparisons
could be made. ''It's not just apples and pears, it's chalk and
cheese,'' is how he put it.
He argued that Northern Ireland had, for example, the burden of two
divided communities, the aftermath of terrorist violence, and, in any
case, would have an assembly which would be completely different in tax
raising terms.
''I don't see any democratic deficit in Scotland,'' he insisted. ''I
don't see any of the huge problems that have torn Northern Ireland
asunder. The constitutional debate here, of course, goes on as in past
decades, but to try and link the special initiatives taken in Northern
Ireland to Scotland is naturally invalid and a false comparison.''
Canon Kenyon Wright, chair of the executive of the Scottish
Constitutional Convention, the body drawing up plans for a Scottish
Parliament, said Mr Aitken and other Government Ministers were
misleading the situation, wilfully or otherwise, by suggesting that a
Scottish Parliament would raise taxes for industry.

TRAFFIC management proposals aimed at tackling Edinburgh's growing
city centre problem will be revealed on Monday.
A two-week exhibition will outline the plans, including the one-way
east flow system for buses only on Princes Street, and traffic lights at
all junctions on George Street.
Other proposals include the permanent closure of Castle Street at
Princes Street, access to George Street from St Andrew Square and
Charlotte Square for buses only, the removal of general traffic from the
north and west sides of Charlotte Square, and a parking ban along the
entire gardens side of Queen Street.
Public consultation has taken place throughout the development of the
proposals and the scheme has been modified to take into account the
results.
Councillor David Begg, chairman of Lothian region's transportation
committee, said: 0''We appreciate that the city is the focus of
Lothian's economy and what we are trying to do is to give more road
space to pedestrians and to those who have an essential need to move
around the city centre quickly and efficiently.''

THE Prime Minister cut the first turf for the #530m NEC semiconductor
factory in Livingston yesterday and warned that under independence the
Scottish economy would suffer grieviously and would not be able to
attract similar projects from foreign firms.
Mr John Major said: ''What concerns me is that a devolved assembly as
proposed for Scotland would be just a stepping stone to separation.'' He
said an independent Scotland would put itself at great disadvantage in
attracting inward investment like the NEC plant.
However, Dr Hisashi Kaneko, NEC president, was dismissive of the
notion that political considerations had carried any weight in his
corporation's investment decision. Asked if the prospect of
constitutional change would have any bearing on NEC's current and future
investment, Dr Kaneko and his colleagues laughed.
''As far as this plant's operation is concerned, we have a very high
quality in the Scottish people working here. There is no relation to the
political situation,'' he said.
He said the workforce, from technicians to managers, had shown itself
to be skilled and extremely productive in meeting the requirements of
customers. ''We get together, we work together, we respect each other,
and we manufacture very high quality products,'' Dr Kaneko added.
In his speech at the ceremony, Mr Major was bullish in his defence of
Government economic policy and Scottish achievement, particulary in high
technology.
''Electronic equipment, dare I say it, beats even whisky into second
place on export earnings,'' he said. ''In Scotland, we produce 11% of
Europe's semiconductors, over 35% of Europe's personal computers, over
50% of Europe's automated banking machines, and nearly 60% of Europe's
workstations. For a country with only 1.5% of Europe's population, this
is a very impressive track record.''
Mr Major said the factory was the largest single inward investment
ever attracted to Scotland and one of the largest ever secured by the
UK. ''It represents a tremendous vote of confidence by NEC in Scotland
and the United Kingdom,'' he said.
The Prime Minister said Scotland had not arrived at its leading
position by accident.
''Our success stems from our commitment to low rates of corporate
taxation and to maintaining a cost-operating base that is among the most
competitive in Europe.
''By our dedication to education and training, we are creating a
workforce of growing quality and flexibility. And, by our on-going
investment in Scotland's infrastructure, we are meeting business demands
for the 21st century,'' he said.
The new factory will create 430 jobs and cover an area the size of six
football pitches. NEC Semiconductors established its European
manufacturing centre at Livingston in 1981. The plant was upgraded in
1987 and since then the number of employees has grown from 300 to nearly
1000.
The opening ceremony was neither incident nor irony-free. It was not a
red carpet that greeted Mr Major but a grey one. A Saltire placed
alongside the Japanese and NEC flags behind the platform inside the
marquee was taken down at the last minute and replaced by a Union Jack.
The Prime Minister's staff were initially suspected of ordering the
switch but both Downing Street and the Scottish Office vigorously denied
this.
NEC said it was the corporation president Dr Hasashi Kaneko who
noticed a Union Jack outside and the Saltire inside. He then asked for
the change.
NEC spokesman Mr Bill Gold said: ''It was a presidential instruction
to make them both the same, relying on simple Japanese logic. No 10 was
not involved at all. In strict terminology, the Japanese flag is a
national flag and the Union Jack is too. This is the flag we have always
flown outside our Livingston plant.''
The assembled press pack were not allowed into the marquee for Mr
Major's speech and had to listen from the other side of the canvas.

FOUR Loyalist paramilitaries who carried out the Hallowe'en gun attack
on the Rising Sun bar were jailed for life yesterday at Belfast Crown
Court.
Seven people -- including two women -- were killed in the outrage at
the village of Greysteel, outside Londonderry, in October 1993. Another
man died six months later. Eight people were injured.
Survivors and relatives of the dead looked on as Torrens Knight, 24,
Jeffrey Deeney, 23, Stephen Irwin, 24, and Brian McNeill, 26, were
sentenced for their part in the UFF atrocity
But relatives of the victims were furious that the judge failed to
give a recommend a minimum term in jail.
The RUC disclosed after the trial that the man who planned the
slaughter of innocent drinkers was still free, as they did not have
enough evidence to charge him.
Detective Chief Superintendent Eric Anderson, who headed the inquiry
into the atrocity, confirmed: ''We caught the foot soldiers but, as has
happened in the past, we sometimes fail to get the godfathers.''
The outrage at the Rising Sun had appalled and disgusted all
right-thinking people in the Province, Lord Justice Carswell told the
four men, who stood to attention in the dock.
The shooting was one of the most callous and cold-blooded massacres in
the catalogue of so many heinous crimes in Ulster, he said.
The massacre was in revenge for the IRA bombing of a fishmonger's on
Belfast's Shankill Road a week before, which left nine Protestants dead.
It brought to 23 the number of people murdered in possibly Ulster's
grimmest week.
UFF bosses in Londonderry, under 24-hour surveillance because of
police fears of retaliation, demanded reprisal action on a similar
scale.
Irwin, armed with an AK47 rifle, was first in to the pub. As customers
prepared for a Hallowe'en dance, he shouted ''Trick or treat'', then
opened fire on a group of women out on a hen night.
Deeney followed, to give Irwin cover, but his gun jammed after he
fired just one shot -- otherwise the death toll could have been far
higher.
Knight, armed with a double-barrelled shotgun, stood guard outside,
and McNeill was the getaway driver.
The court heard that after the shootings McNeill drove Irwin and
Deeney away in his own Skoda car. Knight drove off in an Opel Kadett,
which he unsuccessfully tried to burn, before meeting the other three.
Within an hour of the shootings McNeill, a prime suspect, was under
arrest. RUC Chief Constable Sir Hugh Annesley said that was critical to
the overall police investigation, which at one stage involved 50
detectives.
One was the head of Special Branch in that region, Detective Chief
Superintendent Maurice Neely, who was among 25 key police and military
intelligence officers who died last June in the Chinook helicopter
disaster on the Mull of Kintyre.
Irwin, Knight and Deeney, all hardened members of a unit which the UFF
considered its No 1 outside Belfast, were questioned and eventually
charged along with Irwin after what Sir Hugh yesterday described as ''an
outstanding piece of investigation''.
The four men pleaded not guilty to all charges when the trial opened
on Monday, but changed their pleas on Thursday.
Lord Justice Carswell said that, if the men had contested the charges
and been found guilty, he would unhesitatingly have made a
recommendation of a minimum period of time they should serve in jail.
The four were also given sentences ranging from 16 to 20 years for
attempted murder.
Knight, a roofer from Macosquin, near Coleraine, was given four
separate life sentences for his part in a UFF attack seven months
earlier in which four Catholic workmen, including an IRA man, were shot
dead in Castlerock, County Londonderry.
Deeney, Irwin and McNeill, a shirt-cutter, all live close to each
other in the Protestant Waterside area of Londonderry.
A fifth man, Derek Grieve, 25, of Londonderry, who admitted conspiring
to pervert the course of justice by providing Knight with a false alibi
on the night of the Greysteel attack, was given a two-year suspended
sentence.
Those who died were Mrs Maura Duddy, 59; Mr James Moore, 82, whose son
owns the Rising Sun; Ms Karen Thompson, 19, and her boyfriend Mr Steven
Mullan; Mr John Moyne, 50, who was hit by gunfire as he protected his
wife; a former UDR soldier Mr John Burns, 54, a Protestant; and Mr Joe
McDermott, 60.
Six months after the attack 76-year-old Samuel Montgomery, who had
been treated for a fractured thigh bone after being shot, collapsed with
a blood clot and died at his sister's home.
Although many politicians at the time feared the province was as close
as it will ever be to civil war, Sir Hugh insists that the situation was
never out of control.

GRAEME Henderson, depute director of recreational services (outdoor)
with Inverclyde District Council, is a man with a mission.
His responsibilities for parks and open spaces, which he took over
last year, put him firmly in the driving seat for brightening up the
area.
It is one that has suffered considerable dereliction in recent years,
with the shipbuilding industry particularly hard hit.
Henderson, 38, said: ''I came from Irvine, where I was contracts
manager helping to shape the landscape for a thriving new town.
''But I see my task at Inverclyde as being different, but challenging
in the extreme.''
He has been busy landscaping in the glen leading up from Gourock Park.
This was achieved with improved pathways and fencing, making it into a
safe woodland waterside walk and is being further extended into a nature
trail.
''We were so pleased with the glen at Gourock, and the public reaction
was so good, that we decided to take on a similar project at Devol Glen,
Port Glasgow,'' Henderson revealed.
Funding was made available through the Lower Clyde River Valley
Project, Inverclyde District Council, Strathclyde Regional Council, and
Scottish Natural Heritage.
''The task was a tremendous one, due to the nature of the land. The
basic need was to make a footpath from the waterfront up to the Sustrans
cycle track,'' Henderson continued.
''Due to restricted access, it was necessary to use a horse in
removing felled timber. This meant less damage to the environment.''
The operation required a horse with specialised training. And this is
where Heinrich Jung comes in, a forester and horseman operating out of
Moffat in Dumfriesshire.
He came up with a Clydesdale accustomed to forestry operations,
particularly in woodland areas. Interestingly enough, this is a type of
work increasingly in demand these days.
Heinrich recognises the value of a good working relationship with
trained animals. He has two other horses available, one French and one
Swedish.
Traditionally, they are also used in this kind of forestry work.
Apart from learning about back-to-basics such as using a horse for
woodland work, Henderson also found out about weather in his new part of
the world.
Before going to Inverclyde, he had been told the local climate was a
joke.
''It is claimed that it always rains in the district. It is true that
the rainfall figures are a bit higher than in Glasgow, but the climate
is balmy due to the influence of the firth,'' Henderson pointed out.
'''That probably helps the standard of entries in our local garden
competitions and the Floralfest competition. They are exceedingly high.
''It is doubtful if there would be many domestic gardens elsewhere to
equal them.''
* The floral highlight of Inverclyde this year is the Fleuroselect
display gardens at Gourock Park. This will involve a range of special
flower varieties that have gained awards in Europe in recent years.

<HEADLINE>Micro-motor could help prevent heart attacks</HEADLINE>

A TINY electric motor, only two millimetres in diameter, is being
developed by Scots scientists as a tool to help prevent heart attacks.
The device is intended to be sent through the circulation to power a
burr which cleans fatty deposits from inside the arteries of the heart.
The descaling operation could prevent many of the 16,000 deaths from
heart disease in Scotland each year, and save the need for many of the
3500 coronary by-pass operations.
The fatty deposits, known as atheroma, are responsible for the
clogging of arteries which leads to angina and ultimately to heart
attacks as the deposits build up and narrow the channels through which
blood flows to the heart.
Doctors would use a catheter with the motor on the end and pass it in
through an artery in the patient's thigh before guiding it to the
blockage site.
''You could describe the tool as a mini-borer,'' said Dr Bob Reuben, a
senior lecturer in mechanical engineering at Heriot-Watt University in
Edinburgh.
He and his colleagues in the mechanical and electrical engineering
departments are pioneering the motor as part of a multi-partner project
with industry backing.
The cleaning technique relies on producing debris so small -- smaller
than the size of a blood cell -- that it is safely flushed away by the
blood.
There are descaling devices in use, but they are driven by a motor on
the outside through a drive which goes up the catheter.
The advantage of the new device is that the tiny power cable allows
the catheter to be more flexible, leaving room for other functions --
for example, an ultrasonic sensor to let the operator ''see'' what is
happening.
It is expected to take six years for the device to come into use.
0 It was also hailed as a potential life-saver for infants born with
heart problems.
Dr Neil Wilson, a consultant cardiologist at the Royal Hospital for
Sick Children in Glasgow, said: ''There are a small number of children
with severe obstruction of the heart who would benefit from a procedure
like this -- it could relieve the obstruction without conventional
surgery, which carries significant risks.''

THERE are lots of plants you think you have lost, only to see them pop
up again full of life in the spring, writes IAN WALLS.
Typical are the Meconopsis, often called Himalayan poppies. The
problem is that some are monocarpic, meaning they flower and die.
Others are perennials.
I was looking around in a leafy shrub border I have, to see if my
perennials have survived.
So far, there is little sign of them, but I feel sure they will come
through the winter and charm with their beautiful blue flowers by June.
Gladioli can do a disappearing trick. So can the whole bulb tribe.
What about daffodils, then? And tulips? Will the old favourites let us
down? No way.
They're dependable. Given the slightest chance, up they pop, every
spring. Letting us know the good times are ahead again.
Mind you, lots of weeds are, as we know to our cost, pretty good at
hiding away, too.
Typical is the dreaded horsetail, which disappears in winter only to
come up again in the spring.
A word of warning. If you are thinking of buying a house near a
railway embankment in or around Glasgow, don't do so in late autumn or
winter if you are keen on gardening.
It may be full of horsetail, as so may all the gardens round about.
This weed is a real monster. It goes down to six feet or more, and
survives everything.

IT'S a never-ending argument: is it better to buy hardy plants,
shrubs, and trees from farther north than where you live?
The contention shared by many gardeners is that if you buy from colder
areas, plants will establish and grow better than if you buy from warmer
areas.
This philosophy assumes that it is always colder in the north than in
the south. Of course, this is not always true.
There are uniquely mild areas on the west coast, and some famous
gardens testify to this.
Also coming into the argument is Holland, which sends a lot of
material to the UK. This nursery stock is often leafier and bulkier than
similar items here.
This is not so much because of latitude, but because many plants are
grown in areas with a high water table.
What, then, is the answer of where best to buy? When you visit a
garden centre or supermarket, you can have no idea where the plants came
from in the first case.
My experience is that hardy nursery stock can acclimatise very
quickly, provided it is grown under hardy conditions in the first case.
I have seen roses from the Midlands being planted alongside those from
Aberdeen, and both have gone on to great things.
To summarise: look for quality and consistency. Buy from centres that
have given good results in the past.
More than acclimatisation is involved. There are inherited qualities,
and this is why it is important to buy from suppliers with a good
reputation established over the years.

I HAVE had quite a few complaints from keen gardeners about the very
poor and spasmodic flowering of prepared hyacinth bulbs, writes IAN
WALLS.
They were so numerous I took the matter up with the International
Flower Bulb Centre at Covent Garden, London. They in turn discussed it
with bulb-growing experts in Holland.
Preparing bulbs for early flowering is a complicated business,
depending on precise temperature control. The Dutch Bulb Exporters'
Association had this very much in mind when they introduced an embargo
on the export of hyacinth bulbs.
Prepared hyacinths cannot be exported prior to 10 August. The
association believes this is a great aid to ensuring product standards.
They point out that, as with any live product, while every effort is
made to ensure uniform quality, weather conditions and other outside
factors have to be taken into consideration.
Spring conditions were fairly cold last year, but not considered so
arduous as to create any harvest difficulty. Spring conditions always
have a profound effect on ultimate performance.
My view is that quite a few bulbs did suffer from adverse spring
weather. This is why a lot of bulbs, although grown in the same manner
as previously, failed to produce normal flower spikes or for that matter
had none at all.
Disappointed gardeners should make their feelings known to their
suppliers who will in turn pass on comments to the Dutch Bulb Exporters'
Association and growers generally.
The one consolation is that you should not blame yourself for any
failure of your hyacinths. It was something beyond your control.

A THIRD of houses in Scotland fall into the fuel poverty category, a
Right to Warmth conference in Glasgow heard yesterday.
Professor Tom Markus, Emeritus Professor of Building Science at
Strathclyde University and a member of the Right to Warmth campaign,
told the conference that countries with colder climates experienced far
fewer problems because their houses were better built.
Mr Alex Rowley, Scottish co-ordinator of the National Local Government
Forum Against Poverty, a joint organiser of the conference, said
delegates would be pressing the Government for additional funding to
provide better housing.
''The Government must reverse its policy of withdrawing money from
local authorities and taking away their ability to address the issue of
fuel poverty. Money is being cut back and local authorities are
struggling to renovate the housing stock

BEARSDEN widow Esther Fisher may have come late to rose-growing, but
she has wasted no time in scooping a large bouquet of awards.
So prolific has the senior citizen been that she could even lay claim
to being the most successful woman rose grower in the west of Scotland.
It's certainly not a title she would dream of choosing for herself.
Yet she admits to having won the trophy for the best rose at her local
flower shows at least 20 times over the years.
And other trophies, in other places, too.
However, Esther says: ''I'm just an amateur with some roses at the
front and some more at the back, maybe 70 in all: I haven't really
counted them.''
So how come she wins pretty well every year?
''Actually, my late husband, Ian, was the real rose grower. When he
died, I just started taking an interest in them.
''I don't know if there is any secret to it. You just. . . . well, you
just have to love your roses. And look after them.''
Esther doesn't mind admitting to being ''a bit old-fashioned'' in her
approach to rose growing.
''Some people may take a hedge-cutter to them. I use secateurs,'' she
says. ''And some people may go by the book all the time.
''I'm afraid, though, I was out pruning my roses this week. Some would
say that's far too early in the season.
''I cut mine to three buds from the bottom. And they're not brand new
roses either. Some must be 30 years old if they're a day.
''Protection? No, they don't get any protection. Whatever weather is
going, that's it.
''I do like Fragrant Cloud and Silver Jubilee. Roses must have a good
perfume. They're not proper roses otherwise, I would say.
''And I give them farmyard manure and some fertiliser when they need
it.
''You can't do much in this weather, but I'll put in some bonemeal
when the ground is drier. Then the manure, and the fertiliser later
on.''
Any particular tips on showing roses? Esther thinks probably not.
''I don't go in for dressing up roses at the shows. I think it looks
bad. Take off a broken petal, maybe, that's about all. ''I'm just an
ordinary person who loves roses. And the perfume is the important part
for me.
''You just learn about roses as you go along. You get them in
containers now of course. Any ones I buy are the kind with bare roots. I
buy one or two if I win any vouchers at the flower shows.
''It's the pleasure you get from the roses that makes them so
attractive, and people often come up to the garden just to look at them.
''It's a lot of work for one person, certainly. But I would want to
encourage more people to grow roses and more women to go in for showing
them,'' says Esther.
''You don't get to keep the trophies, of course, but it's a great
achievement to win.
''I've no greenhouse, or anything like that. But if I can win some of
the trophies, couldn't other people do the same?''

POLICE are to investigate a claim that convicted child murderer Robert
Black, jailed for at least 35 years for killing three schoolgirls, two
of them Scots, has confessed to up to four unsolved child murders.
According to a newspaper report yesterday, Scottish-born Black made
the confession in Wakefield Jail, Yorkshire, to a prison officer
allegedly trained by police in special techniques aimed at winning
Black's confidence.
The man co-ordinating child murder inquiries by several UK police
forces, Mr Andrew Brown, Assistant Chief Constable (Crime Strategy) of
Lothian and Borders, said: ''We will obviously want to investigate the
claims made today and take account of it in our continuing
investigation.''
Black, 47, was convicted of the murders of Susan Maxwell, 11, from
Cornhill-on-Tweed, Caroline Hogg, five, from Portobello in Edinburgh,
and 10-year-old Susan Harper, of Leeds.
Earlier this week, three English Appeal Court judges refused him leave
to appeal against his convictions imposed at Newcastle Crown Court last
May.
Last night, Mr Jack Quick, a governor at Wakefield Prison responsible
for personnel, training and media liaison, said he found the report
''absolutely amazing''. If Black had confessed to unsolved killings, it
would have been common knowledge among the staff.
''As for the police having trained a prison officer into coercing a
prisoner to admit crimes, we do not do it,'' he said.

READING a national garden journal the other day, I noted it was
assuming that the general public in Scotland would be rushing out into
their gardens next month.
It is true there is a surge of enthusiasm then, as northern gardeners
start to buy in necessities and cautiously survey their domains.
It must be said that Easter is the real universal starting point,
especially when it falls in the middle of April, as is the case this
year.
But there can be plenty to do before that. Lawns and their edges
require a trim; there are beds to fork, paths to repair, gravel paths to
rake. And, of course, weeds must be attended to.
Keen gardeners should be starting off seeds of slow developers such as
African Marigolds, antirrhinums, begonias, dahlias, geraniums, and
possibly lobelias.
Pick a light window in a reasonably heated room, or get your
propagating case into action.
It's also time to make sure early shoots of herbaceous plants and
other over-wintered plants are not being nibbled by slugs. You really
can't start too early with slug control.

<HEADLINE>Channel ferries run again after day of disruption</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
CHANNEL ferry services were returning to normal last night after
another day of travel chaos caused by striking French seamen.
However, British travellers and ferry companies still faced the
possibility of further disruption as the dispute over ''cut-price''
non-EU crews on British ships remained far from over.
The French protesters agreed to end their blockade of Calais some
hours before the end of their 48-hour strike. This enabled the Channel's
big two companies -- P &amp; O European Ferries and Stena Sealink -- to
resume their Dover-Calais operations. The first P &amp; O ship docked at
Calais shortly after midday and Sealink's first ferry arrived later.
For nearly 24 hours before the re-opening of Calais, the two firms had
been operating instead between Dover and Zeebrugge. This had forced
stranded British holidaymakers to make an 80-mile journey to the Belgium
port so they could get home.
For the second day, there were angry demonstrations at Boulogne from
where Meridian -- the UK company at the centre of the dispute --
continued to operate freight services to Folkestone.
Riot police used tear gas on the protesters who burned tyres and
barricades and spray-painted Meridian's now empty buildings. The seamen
failed to halt the Meridian operation which uses Polish crewmen -- a
move bitterly opposed by French seafarers who fear the cheap labour
threatens their jobs.
Aviation and Shipping Minister Lord Goschen said: ''This sort of
behaviour is intolerable and in total breach of the international
commitments to which their (the strikers') government has agreed.''
''French trade unions have no right to impose their views on which
crews should be employed on UK ferries.''
P &amp; O had a full Dover-Calais service running again by mid-afternoon.
Sealink, with two ships out of action because of the strike, was
expecting to be operating normally again by this morning.
Sally Line was resuming passenger services between Ramsgate and
Dunkirk yesterday afternoon while Brittany Ferries -- whose French crews
eventually defied the strike -- ran a full service yesterday.
Channel Tunnel services were again unaffected by the dispute with a
large number of French police keeping protesters away from the tunnel
terminal at Calais.

Informality can be charming, says Wendy Jack.
FORMALITY versus informality: the great thing about the 90s is that
you pays your money and takes your choice.
On balance, informality is currently looking the favourite.
With more and more women working outside the home and contemporary
houses being generally smaller than in the past, informality suits
hectic lifestyles admirably.
Growing in appeal is the dining kitchen, that happy, homely hub to
which guests and family are equally drawn.
Depending on taste, a dining kitchen can look fairly tailored,
mirroring the style set by the kitchen units, or a charming, cottagey
setting, just the place to soothe ruffled, weary feathers as they return
home to roost each night.
This kind of informality (illustrated here by Laura Ashley), with
softly ruffled pelmets, frilled cushion seats and fresh country fabrics,
harmonises perfectly with wooden or paint-effect kitchen units.
Collectively, they add up to a comfortable re-creation of the
farmhouse kitchen; stand a cast-iron doorstop cockerel on the floor, and
you could almost believe you were in Old Macdonald's place.
One of the nicest apsects of this style is that you can mix and match
all sorts of domestic paraphernalia into a comfortable clutter, which
works very well.
Laura Ashley's Somerton fabric, used here, is a glorious celebration
of funny, summery days, with lofty hollyhocks scrambling skywards.
Complementing it to perfection is the blue Trefoil Chambray fabric
used as highlighting touches on curtain edges, pelmet, table cloth, and
chair cover.
The Somerford border on the walls allows the floral theme to embrace
the room. Pretty, yet not overbearing.
Such a setting is made for dressers, plate racks, distressed or limed
wood, a pulley hung with copper pans and dried flowers -- updates of the
kind of thing that might have been found in grandmother's home.
On the other hand, the formal dining room -- still desirable to many
-- receives a lighter touch than in times past from Marks and Spencer,
with the elegant Cadogan range of hand-crafted pieces in cherrywood and
matching veneers.
Available in a wide range of pieces, from video/TV units to bookcases,
bureau, and a variety of tables, it typifies the growing enthusiasm
shown especially by younger people -- or those starting afresh -- for
lighter toned woods.
While the darker mahogany, the traditional and enduring favourite,
remains very popular, these light-dappled newer woods reflect in many
ways the look of the Nineties, less ponderous and less formal.
Cadogan, while clearly influenced by the past, has a fresh and
distinctive look.
The twin pedestalled dining table has updated familiarity, as do the
balloon-backed chairs.
The clean cut, handsome sideboard with its optional glazed top
cupboard, in design terms successfully marries the traditional with the
contemporary.
This is the kind of furniture that blends beautifully either with
traditional, formal tableware, or with the latest casual dining styles
now in such sharp focus.
Beauty, as they say, is in the eye of the beholder. But whatever you
have naturally favoured in the past, many will find themselves torn now
between the informal and the formal.

IT'S pouring rain and a gang of bored children have been screaming
round the house for the last six hours. There is only one thing to do --
send them down to the cellar.
That doesn't mean inflicting a Victorian values punishment: converted
cellars can be brilliant children's playrooms.
They can also be workshops, wine stores, recording studios, snooker
rooms, or just a great place to hold a party.
If your house seems too small for a growing family, the valuable space
you need may be under your feet.
That dusty, dark, damp cellar could have a whole new lease of life as
a valuable asset that will make your home a better place to live and
improve its appeal when you come to sell.
If you are lucky enough to have a cellar, it's crazy not to consider
upgrading it into a proper living room. Some of the work is an easy DIY
project, but other aspects require need advice and the use of competent
builders.
First, it's a good idea to take a careful look at the space available.
You may have a warren of small rooms that could provide a decent space
if some dividing walls were removed. But consult a professional -- those
walls may actually hold up the house!
You may also need to plan and cost the provision of heat, light, and
water. Many projects will require waterproof fittings to make sure
safety is maintained.
Then there is damp, the biggest and most expensive problem likely to
affect your new look.
It is pointless pressing ahead with cosmetic improvements if the area
suffers from damp. The room will be useless and unhealthy, and you will
have wasted your money. Damp has to be tackled -- often by professionals
-- and it can be a major cost factor.
Minor dampness can be lived with, particularly if you only intend the
room as a workshop.
If the cellar is only slightly damp, you might be able to tackle the
problem using ventilated dry linings -- a DIY project that most people
would be able to do sucessfully.
Typically, the job would involve digging out the floor, laying a
damp-proof membrane, and then laying a good, thick concrete slab.
The dry lining is then fixed to the wall, leaving ventilation gaps at
top and bottom which can be disguised by skirting board and coving.
The traditional way to damp-proof cellars is tanking, and it is often
best to call in a firm.
Tanking involves applying several layers of a special render to the
walls and floor to provide a completely waterproof coating.
It is vital that nothing ever penetrates this coating, or the
surrounding water will find a way inside your nice, dry cellar.
That means laying electric cable in channels which can be tanked over
and even providing supports for shelves before the job is done.
Other details may include improving ventilation to prevent
condensation during use.
But when it is all done and the decorating completed, you will have
dramatically increased the useful space in your home -- and may even
have created a haven where you can hide when the children next go the
rampage.

TWO rail workers were praised by ScotRail yesterday for their
''magnificent'' reaction when fire broke out on a train packed with
almost 300 passengers.
Driver Mr Gordon Kynoch, 26, and conductor Mr David Tod, 31, were
faced with the emergency when smoke appeared in the rear car of a
Bathgate-Edinburgh morning commuter train as it approached the
Carmondean junction in West Lothian.
Between them, they halted the train, calmly ushered the passengers in
the carriage involved into the other two cars, separated the dangerous
unit and alerted the fire brigade.
They then identified the source of the fire -- in the underframe of
the rear car -- and used all the extinguishers aboard to tackle the
blaze, which was finally put out by firefighters.
They took their passengers -- who included a few schoolchildren -- to
North Livingston station, from which most were taken by bus into
Edinburgh.
ScotRail operations and engineering director Mr Peter Summerhayes was
so impressed by the actions of Mr Kynoch, from Falkirk, and Mr Tod, from
Edinburgh, that he caught the first available Glasgow-Edinburgh train to
thank them personally and presented each with a #50 cheque.
''The way they handled the situation was magnificent. It was a
potentially dangerous situation, but they did what they did without
injury to any passengers. I apologise to the passengers for the
inconvenience they were caused, and I am glad that nobody was hurt.''
Last night, investigators were checking whether the outbreak was
caused by an electrical fault which could have set off the fire in dirt
on the car's underside.
Mr Kynoch said later that he felt ''neither up nor down'' after the
scare, but Mr Tod admitted to being ''a bit shaken''.
The rolling stock involved is under lease to ScotRail and is about 35
years old. However, a ScotRail spokesman said that the fire could not be
put down to the age of the car involved.

A touch of the Orient has been
created in a courtyard of
Livingston's St John's
Hospital. An oasis of calm
loosely based on the Japanese
tea garden, it is hailed
as an object of delight by
patients, visitors and staff.
Kyoto Corner
TWENTY metres along the corridor from a Scottish hospital's modern
tearoom, to the delight of staff, visitors, and patients alike, lies a
jewel of the Orient.
Nestling in one of the many courtyards at St John's, Livingston, is a
rojiniwa or Japanese tea garden, whose authentic look suggests the hand
of a Zen master.
But the truth is much more romantic. Cheshire landscape architect
Peter Swift spent eight months studying Japanese gardening in Kyoto.
The city that boasts the remarkable Katsura Imperial Gardens operates
some 200 gardening companies, governed by an association which, in turn,
offers gardening apprenticeships.
It is unusual for a Westerner to join the ranks -- only three Britons
have done so. Swift got lucky.
''The year I applied, the association president was Yasutaro Tanaka,
who helped build the garden in Holland Park, London, for the Japan
festival. The timing was right -- there was some kudos for him in taking
me on.''
While in Kyoto prefecture, Swift worked on six gardens, including one
for the head of the Japanese Yakuza or Mafia.
During that period, the art director of St Mungo's Museum of Religion
in Glasgow went East looking for someone to construct a Zen dry
landscape in the grounds.
Buddha was smiling on Peter Swift again, and he worked subsequently on
the St Mungo's assignment with five others from the Japanese gardening
company.
The background to the Livingston tea garden is similarly propitious.
St John's formed an arts committee to develop the building's dead
space; they called in the expertise of Nan Mulder, project coordinator
(arts and hospitals) for Artlink -- an organisation promoting
cooperation between disabled and non-disabled people.
Having followed her advice about commissioning Scottish artists in a
structured way, the committee selected -- among others, including Peter
Thomson, Sylvia Von Hartmann, and Jack Knox -- the work of George
Donald, who has lived in Japan.
Donald knew of Peter Swift, hence he was invited to create an oasis of
calm, loosely based on the Japanese tea garden.
Staff appreciate it. Ian Wallace, consultant urologist and director of
Clinical Services, runs a clinic overlooking the garden.
He enthuses: ''It is a focus of interest and good relaxation for
patients, colleagues, and myself.''
The garden encapsulates all the essential tea-garden characteristics.
Zen Buddhism and Japanese gardening are virtually synoymous.
Zen influences all seven styles, from hill to stroll gardens, but its
connection with three styles, including the tea garden, is extremely
direct.
Swift explains: ''Everything must be set low, to reduce people from
all walks of life to the same level.
''And everything en route to the tea house must foster a spiritual
atmosphere to purify the mind before taking tea -- a ritual designed to
instil humility, restraint and sensibility.''
Sacred associations include a kinked path, spaced stepping stones (to
focus the mind and enforce slow progress), and a Shishi-odoshi or
deer-scarer. This is a bamboo construction that drips water
soporifically onto a stone flag.
A stone lantern (hand-carved in Japan), a drinking basin and a
grouping of rocks form the focal points of the landscape composition.
The courtyard as a whole is split into two spaces by a bamboo lattice
fence which initially affords tantalising glimpses rather than a clear
view.
Planting is kept to a minimum, in keeping with the Zen maxim that a
garden is complete only when nothing else can be stripped away.
Given the stylised, ritualistic nature of his art, how much free rein
can Peter Swift allow his creativity?
''There are infinite permutations. The Japanese only appear to portray
things sternly. Materials themselves allow for infinite expression -- no
two rocks are the same.''
With greater emphasis in the health service on a patient's total
experience, the tea garden -- officially unveiled this month -- is
perceived as contributing to the desired overall feeling of ease.
St John's secretary to the board, Jim Eunson, believes it is money
well spent.
''In relation to the hospital trust's annual budget, the garden and
our other artworks represent a very small amount. If the building is
nice to be in, that's half the battle for patients.''

FORMER Army major James Hewitt told the Bonnyrigg murder trial
yesterday that one of the accused, Mr Robert Smith, was a highly
professional soldier under his command during the Gulf War.
He had strongly recommended him for promotion and did not think Smith
would have ''lost his bottle'' under pressure.
Major Hewitt, who caused a furore when he claimed in the book,
Princess in Love, to have been the Princess of Wales's lover, was giving
evidence on Mr Smith's behalf at the High Court in Edinburgh.
Mr Smith, 33, a former lance-corporal in the Life Guards, denies
murdering 63-year-old retired mining engineer Mr David Dunn in
Bonnyrigg, Midlothian, on October 19 last year. Co-accused Mr Gerald
McQuade, 40, and Mr Paul Bootland, 25, also deny murder.
All three are also charged with attempting to murder an off-duty
policeman and two civilians and robbing the Bank of Scotland in High
Street, Bonnyrigg, on the same day.
Mr Hewitt told the court that he was now a self-employed businessman
living near Exeter, Devon. He said that Lance-Corporal Smith had been
under his command in the Life Guards for three years from 1989 to 1992
and he knew him very well as a soldier.
Mr Smith had been a tank commander during the Gulf War and Major
Hewitt led his squadron. The squadron had been in the southern flank of
the spearhead and had taken part in an intensive four-day battle. His
four-man Challenger tank crew had acted commendably throughout the Gulf
conflict, he added.
Mr Hewitt said that he had prepared three annual reports on Mr Smith
and had assessed him as ''excellent'' or ''very good'' in all areas
including team spirit and acceptance of responsibility.
He described him as ''completely reliable, steady, and unquestionably
loyal,'' adding: ''He thoroughly deserves promotion at the earliest
opportunity.''
Asked about Mr Smith's demeanour in combat, Mr Hewitt replied: ''He
was, as I expected, a highly professional tank commander.'' He confirmed
that he had been able to observe Mr Smith's conduct at close quarters
during the heat of the battle.
Mr Hewitt said he had been surprised to learn that Mr Smith had gone
on the run from the Army on his return from the Gulf and that he had
been involved in an armed robbery.
Mr Smith has admitted robbing the bank and conceded that ''beyond a
shadow of a doubt'' it was his pistol that fired the shot that killed Mr
Dunn.
He claims, however, that he did not intentionally fire at Mr Dunn,
never saw him at the scene, did not know until afterwards that anyone
had died, and was not aware that his gun had fired.
Mr Donald Findlay, QC, counsel for Mr Bootland, asked Mr Hewitt if the
reports he had prepared on Mr Smith suggested that the accused was a man
likely to ''lose his bottle''.
''No, they don't suggest that at all,'' replied Mr Hewitt.
''I like to think that I know my soldiers and what they are likely to
do in a situation that puts them under pressure. If you're asking me
whether he would lose his bottle, I would have to say I don't think he
is that type of character.''
Mr Hewitt said he also did not think Mr Smith was the type of
character to go absent without leave or rob a bank.
The trial continues.

BANKING union officials yesterday dropped plans for a second one-day
strike at the Clydesdale Bank after talks at the conciliation service
Acas led to a revised management offer.
Mr Keith Brookes, assistant secretary with the Banking, Insurance, and
Finance Union, said the union would be balloting 4000 members on the new
proposals.
The dispute centred on plans for rises for staff whose work was deemed
''satisfactory'' under a performance-related pay scheme. This has been
revised.
Mr Pat Lennon, the bank's head of human resources, said: ''Our revised
proposals on performance-related pay are both fair and equitable.'' He
said details would be issued next week.
Mr Brookes said management had also increased its pay offer from 2% to
3.5% for all skills grades.

THE Japanese have been seriously into gardening from the 7th century.
They designed their gardens to resemble their landscape.
The picture was of an island country, with mountains, streams, and
stands of tall trees.
And unlike those of us in Scotland, they found moss a useful addition
to the scene for a soft area of bedding.
There is a lot to learn about Japanese gardens. The main elements
involved have symbolic meaning.
Water can be a tranquil element, mirroring surrounding plants, or fast
and flowing. Rocks create a dramatic, central theme.
The main planting materials include Japanese maples, azaleas, bamboo,
skimmia, and ferns. The aim is to achieve a mass effect with a few
selected species.
The predominant colour should be green, and plants which drop the
whole flower head are to be avoided. Samurai warriors prefer flowers
that lose. You can opt for a Zen garden, which is composed mainly of
gravel and stone.
Peter Modler of Ochil House, Dunning, Perthshire, is secretary of the
Japanese Garden Society, and I asked him for some basic advice to follow
when making a Japanese garden.
''Look for a level area, where peace and tranquility can be the
theme,'' he said.
''Keep your design simple. Do not try to put too much into the garden.
''Remember that harshness of stone must be balanced by softness of
plants. And don't go in for gaudy colours.
''Finally, remember that no Japanese garden is complete until you
can't take any more out of it.''
Once the work of creating a Japanese garden has been achieved, the
upkeep is minimal.
For the really serious gardener, one of the best examples in the
country is at Tatton Park, off the M6 motorway near Knutsford, Cheshire.
It is managed, maintained and financed by Cheshire County Council on
behalf of the National Trust.
A series of courses is being run there. The tutor is Robert Ketchell,
a landscape architect.
Day courses on a wide variety of subjects cost #50, and it's up to
#520 for an intensive 14-day course.
Certificates are issued by Keele University. Full details from the
Head of Gardens at Tatton Park, Knutsford, Cheshire WA16 6QN. Tel: 01565
750780. Courses start in early April.

BY the late 1970s and early 1980s, when people were just waking up to
the possibilities of fires with real flames run by gas, the early
prototypes were still somewhat unsophistocated.
And they were generally so inefficient in terms of heat that the Gas
Board refused to endorse most of them.
The ''living flame'' gas fire has come into its own through years of
development, and where they were still relatively unique 10 years ago,
today they are among the most popular types of fire on the market.
With today's lifestyles, when both parents in many households work,
there is an increasing need to provide all the trappings of comfort with
the minimum of effort and time.
Changes in the design of such fires have evolved at the same rate as
their growing popularity.
The fires have become more compact, more realistic, and infinitely
more efficient.
Gone are the days when a taper had to be lit and held above the coals
until the gas ignited.
A more likely option now is the automatic pilot light, although this
is only operational when pressed by hand.
Now, however, enter a new advance in technology -- the hand-held
remote control unit.
It switches the fire on and off, as well as controlling the flame, and
dispenses with the need for a permanent pilot light.
The innovation is unique in the UK to the Gazco VFC (variable flame
control) convector gas fire, although Gazco also has a wall-mounted,
remote-control panel.
Prices of the fire with a hand-held remote control start at around
#540 (including VAT).
So now you can settle down in front of the box, and heat up at the
touch of a button.

A GLASGOW couple have won a victory over the Government in the
European Court of Human Rights over issues involving the adoption of
their son.
Mr Antony McMichael and his wife, Margaret, had complained they had
not received a fair hearing when they fought a custody case over their
son, who had been taken into care. Their son was later adopted after Mrs
McMichael began to suffer from mental illness.
The European Court of Human Rights has upheld the complaint that they
did not receive a fair hearing.
The couple, however, will not be able to challenge the adoption of
their son, whose present identity is withheld.
Despite this the couple intend to continue to fight to win back
custody. Speaking at the Glasgow offices of their lawyer, Mr Peter
McCann, Mr McMichael said: ''We have a battle ahead, and I just hope the
story has a happy ending.''
Mrs McMichael said: ''I'm delighted with the European Court's verdict.
I want to see the baby back in my care and I see this as a huge step
towards that. We are going to try even though it's very remote.''
The couple took their case to Strasbourg where they were represented
by Mr McCann. They complained they had received an unfair hearing before
a children's hearing and a sheriff court where they were unfairly denied
documents relevant to their case.
Mr McMichael complained he had no legal right to custody despite being
the child's natural father. His name did not appear on the child's birth
certificate because he and the child's mother were not married until
later.
The Commission of Human Rights, the body which filters cases destined
for the Court of Human Rights, found against the couple when they
complained about procedures leading to their son being taken into care.
It also found against them when they complained against access to their
child being stopped and the child being freed for adoption.
But the commission found in favour of their other complaints, mainly
that they had been unfairly refused full access to officially-held
information on their case.
The Government conceded before the Strasbourg court there had been a
technical absence of fairness in the couple's case in the children's
hearing and Glasgow Sheriff Court in February and October 1988.
The UK Government had also conceded the ''unfair character'' of the
care proceedings. This, the court found, did not afford protection for
the child's parents under the section of the European Human Rights
Convention
The European Court noted the McMichaels had not claimed for
reimbursement of costs or expenses. But they sought compensation for
distress, sorrow, and injury to health.
The court found that no practical benefit would have accrued to the
McMichaels if the procedural deficiency had not existed. But it found
that part of the ''evident trauma'' they had suffered was due to their
being refused sight of relevant documents.
The court ordered payment to them jointly of #8000 in compensation.
The judgment means that other parents who challenge adoption of their
children will not have to deal with the refusal of courts in Scotland to
hand over reports on the case.
The ruling is expected to apply to children's hearings and to sheriff
court cases.

RECENTLY I went looking for a set of washable fabric place mats to go
with some pottery -- something a bit different in a deep blue fabric to
match the border around the plates.
They had to be easy-care, washable, and reasonably heat resistant.
I found a very poor selection of thin fabric mats, some bulky, quilted
table mats, sorry-looking hessian mats, and, eventually, some excellent
cotton padded mats in various colours.
These were more than #6 each, and since I wanted eight, they were not
exactly an impulse buy. Also, they weren't the right shade of blue, so I
decided to make the mats myself.
Using fabric in two of the colours in the plates, the design worked
well and I was quite chuffed when they were finished.
They are simple and satisfying to make, and I hope that you'll enjoy
working on them as much as I did.
I used polyester/cotton sheeting, which, because it is so wide, is
probably the best value in a good quality, plain, easy-care cotton
around.
It comes in a variety of colours and a few toning patterned designs,
and is available in the big fabric shops.
Two layers of sheeting were used, separated by a layer of iron-on
thick Vilene interfacing.
This is also available from most fabric departments, from firm to
light weights -- the heavier the weight, the more heat resistant the
mats will be.
You could also use two layers of interfacing, one pressed on top of
the other.
TO MAKE THE PATTERN FOR THE MATS:
Use a sheet of brown paper, and for the back and border of the mat,
cut out a rectangle 56cm (22in) x 46cm (18in).
Measure along both sides from each corner 12cm (4[1/2]in) and make a
pencil mark . Join these marks with a ruler and cut along this line,
cutting a triangular shape off each corner
For the contrasting centre, cut a rectangle 42cm (16[1/2]in) x 30cm
(12in).
TO MAKE EIGHT PLACE MATS YOU WILL NEED:
1 metre (39in) plain poly/cotton sheeting, 2.30m wide; 1.20m (48in)
heavy iron-on Vilene interfacing 90cm (36in) wide.
CUTTING OUT:
As the sheeting is usually sold folded into four, open it out once, to
a double width of 115cm (45in) wide.
Cutting them side by side, across the width, cut four of the back and
border pattern from plain sheeting and four of the centre in the
contrast fabric.
Cut eight pieces of interfacing using the centre pattern piece.
SEWING INSTRUCTIONS -- THE BACK AND BORDER:
Using an iron, press under 6mm ([1/4]in) along the four straight sides
of the back and border piece. Do not turn under the cross cut corners.
Fold the corner edge in half, back on itself, and stitch across the
corner from the fold to the crease of the turnings. Do not stitch across
the turnings.
Stitch all four corners in this way. Turn the corners right side out
and press flat to form the border.
THE CONTRAST CENTRE:
Press the iron-on interfacing to the back of the contrasting centre
piece.
Insert the centre underneath the border, tucking it into the corners
so that it lies flat. Tack and machine stitch along the folded edge of
the border to hold it in place. Press well.
They had to be
washable and
heat resistant

THERE has been a lot of talk about the depleted ozone layer and the
poor quality of the air we breathe. But the air inside your home can
often be less than good.
Dangerous pollutants vary, from carbon monoxide and radon to solvent
vapours and formaldehyde. It is important to know the tell-tale signs
and how to avoid such pollutants.
Poor ventilation can mean that potentially dangerous fumes (like those
given off by paint and the material used for loft insulation) can build
up.
It is also important that rooms in which portable bottled gas heaters
and paraffin stoves are kept are also well ventilated.
Airless and poorly heated rooms are also prone to mould, which can be
a real and recurring headache on damp surfaces.
So serious can problems of poor air be in the home that the Scottish
Office's Environment Department has produced a free leaflet, Good Air
Quality in Your Home.
It shows that healthy, good quality air is particularly important for
''certain vulnerable household members: babies, children, pregnant women
and their unborn babies, the elderly, and those with respiratory or
allergic diseases such as asthma.''
The booklet reveals where the dangers lie and how the various problems
can best be dealth with.
Mould, one of the most common causes of allergies, means dampness, so
to get rid of the mould you have to find the source of the dampness and
eradicate it.

THE parents of a teenager who travelled to Malaysia on his father's
credit card told him yesterday: ''We love you and want you back.''
Peter Kelly, 14, disappeared after his father banned him from seeing a
football match on Tuesday night.
Pat and John Kelly, of South Harrow, north London, told how they
feared for his safety after he had run away and flew to Kuala Lumpur.
The couple said they were afraid their son might not be able to fend
for himself on the streets of a border town.
Mrs Kelly, 50, a civil servant, told of her shock after Peter had
telephoned home at 9.15pm on Thursday to tell her his whereabouts.
In a three-minute call, the boy told his mother that he had run out of
money and had been refused permission to stay at the hotel Puteri Pan
Pacific, in the town of Johor Baharu, close to the border with
Singapore.
Peter, an aeroplane fanatic and travel enthusiast, boarded a flight to
Kuala Lumpur on Tuesday night with his father's credit cards and
passport, before travelling a further 200 miles to Johor Baharu.
Mrs Kelly said: ''I was totally shocked. We have no connection with
Malaysia and know virtually nothing about it and neither did Peter.
''We don't know how he is or where he is at the moment or how he is
going to get back.
''We are very, very worried and desperate to know where he is.
''My worst fear is that someone will snatch him or someone will hurt
him and we will never see him again.''
Peter disappeared on Tuesday night while his father was taking his
brother, Michael, 11, and sister, Helen, eight, to a football match at
Arsenal.
Mr Kelly, 59, said Peter had been sulking because he had been told off
for leaving the family's video collection in a mess.
He has gone missing several times before and last June he managed to
board a flight to Paris.
On previous occasions he has travelled the country by train and been
stranded several times in Scotland.
Mrs Kelly said: ''We have been in touch with the High Commission in
Kuala Lumpur and have been told that it is a very safe place for him to
be.
''We are not angry with him -- we just want him back. I can't wait for
him to come home and to give him a big hug.''
Mr Kelly, who works at Heathrow Airport for a parcels delivery
company, said: ''He is a loner and a dreamer, but also a very
resourceful boy.''
He added: ''I find it incredible in this day and age of high-profile
security that a 14-year-old boy has been able to get on to this flight.
The Metropolitan Police are now working with the British High
Commission, Interpol and Malaysian police in an effort to track him
down.

THE Scottish dimension in education must continue to flourish, Lord
James Douglas-Hamilton said in Edinburgh yesterday.
The Scottish Education Minister told a forum of the Scottish
Consultative Council on the Curriculum that today, more than ever
before, there was a huge interest in Scottish history, language, music,
and dance.
There was also evidence that young people wanted to explore their
inheritance.
He said: ''Our task has to be to make sure that the framework of
teaching and learning set out for all Scottish schools identifies
opportunities for the Scottish dimension to flourish.
''The Scottish CCC is continuing to spread the riches of Scottish
culture and heritage amongst young people and encourages the future
promotion of the Scottish dimension. Scottish studies and the resources
available can enormously enrich that broad educational framework.''
Lord James said it was right to encourage pupils' sense of Scottish
identity and to celebrate Scottish traditions and achievements.

A GP who bludgeoned his daughter to death with a hammer and then
stabbed her after hearing voices in his head telling him to ''kill'' was
yesterday ordered to be detained indefinitely at a psychiatric hospital.
Dr Patrick Alesworth, 48, attacked his student daughter Sara, 22, at
the family home in Northumberland Drive, Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire,
last April.
The local GP, who suffered from a long history of mental illness, then
killed the family dog and fled to France, Reading Crown Court heard.
He admitted a charge of manslaughter.
Mr Brian Barker, QC, prosecuting, told how Sara was last seen alive by
the GP's youngest daughter, Kathleen, at 8.15am on April 13.
''She was in bed and the family dog was sleeping in the same room. The
defendant's wife had left for work,'' he said.
''The defendant has told a psychiatrist that his first thoughts when
waking were that he had resolved to kill himself and his family. He has
said he had a voice in his head telling him to kill.
''Between 9.30am and 10.00am he got up, collected a hammer and kitchen
knife and went upstairs where he met Sara on the landing.
''He attacked her with the hammer before stabbing her with the knife.
The defendant has said that he then killed the dog in the same manner,
before he dressed and washed the weapons and replaced them where they
had come from.''
Alesworth then sat at home jotting notes before phoning in sick to the
medical agency he was working with at the time.
He later phoned his wife, Jane, and then booby-trapped the house with
timing devices.
Mr Barker said: ''He severed gas pipes and set timing devices to a
number of electrical appliances, designed, it seems, to catch fire and
then, presumably, to cause a gas explosion.
''All three timers were set to come on at 5pm.''
A post-mortem examination revealed that Sara, a student at Bournemouth
University in Dorset, had been struck 14 times with the club hammer.
The court heard that at lunchtime the doctor bought false number
plates from Halfords in Aylesbury and later returned home to fit them to
his car.
Kathleen returned home that afternoon and found a note in her father's
handwriting on the front door, saying there had been a gas leak.
Shortly afterwards a neighbour alerted Mrs Alesworth who came home and
confronted her husband in the drive. After a struggle Mrs Alesworth went
inside the house.
''She ran upstairs to find Sara's body face down in the bedroom with a
dog at the base of the bed.''
The doctor then swapped his own car for his wife's J-registered Volvo
and drove to Portsmouth, from where he caught a boat to France.
Alesworth was eventually arrested in the village of Pleubally at
around 1pm on April 14, after he had tried to hijack a French motorist's
car.
Mr Barker said: ''He was found in a layby on his own, apparently worse
for wear from drink and drugs.''
Drugs and a syringe were found in the car with him and he was later to
say he was going to use them to kill himself, Mr Barker added.
Mrs Alesworth and her eldest daughter Emma, 21, were in court to hear
the sentence.
Friends said Sara, a catering student, was a hard worker who had
planned a career in the hotel industry, and loved tennis and skiing.
Mr Alan Mainds, defending, described the killing of Sara as ''a Greek
tragedy''.
He added: ''Patrick Alesworth was the psychiatrist who could not cure
himself from the illness of the mind which gnawed its way through his
confidence and in the end, through his reason, which caused him to
commit this dreadful act.''
He said that both Dr Alesworth's family and colleagues had stood by
him since the killing.
A statement by his brother-in-law, read to the court, said: ''I bear
Patrick no malice for what has happened to Sara, only forgiveness. He
was not in control of his actions, he is not evil or malicious in any
way.''
The judge, Mr Justice Morison, criticised psychiatrists who were
treating Alesworth throughout the months leading up to the killing.
He said: ''It would appear that his state of mind and the risk that he
posed to others was not detected.''

The Herald's team of reviewers presents an informed guide to your
listening pleasure.
CLASSICAL
Compiled by MICHAEL TUMELTY.
Julius Caesar (Radio 3, Sunday, 7.30pm)
* ''BUDDIES, US citizens, fellow-Americans; listen up . . . '' OK, OK,
I know this is the classical music selection of armchair entertainment,
but, hey, we musos are a cultured lot, having shaken a spear or two in
our time. And tomorrow night, Radio 3 offers a fascinating version of
Shakespeare's tragedy, a new co-production between the BBC and Los
Angeles Theater Works. Major interest in hearing how some of the big and
small screens' best-known voices adapt to the bard. Starring Richard
(Close Encounters) Dreyfuss as Mark Antony, Stacy (Mike Hammer) Keach as
Marcus Brutus, Jobeth (Poltergeist) Williams as Portia, Bonnie (Mrs John
''Die Hard'' McLane) Bedelia as Calpurnia, and Kelsey (Frasier) Grammer
as Murellus. With Hal Gould (everything from Incommunicado to The Golden
Girls) in the title role, and many other famous Hollywood voices. Aye;
as the man said: ''How many ages hence shall this our lofty scene be
acted o'er, In States unborn and Accents yet unknown?'' Yup, verily.
King of Hearts (Sunday, Channel Four, 9pm)
* FIVE years ago, Channel Four commissioned six one-hour operas
especially for television production. The first three were screened last
year. On consecutive Sundays, beginning tomorrow, the last three will
have their debut. First off is King of Hearts, an offbeat, off-the-wall
opera with music by American flavour of the decade, Michael Torke. An
anti-opera really -- it bears almost no resemblance to the conventional
form -- King of Hearts is about this sad guy, Antoine, a physics
teacher, who lives his life vicariously by reading other people's
discarded notes. By coincidence, the lover of Antoine's therapist gets a
job in the same school, and -- whoops -- before you know it, a mutual
attraction is developing. The whole thing becomes terribly convoluted
and begins to mirror the plot of Flaubert's Madame Bovary, which book
features also in the plot. Torke's chugging, energetic post-minimalist
music pulsates away in the background, though he has failed to give the
three singers -- Hilton McRea, Lynne Davies, and Omar Ebrahim, along
with a raucous chorus of 'orrible, swearing schoolkids -- much in the
way of memorable lyricism around which to wrap their neuroses. Very
mannered. Strictly for the curious.
POP / ROCK
Compiled by DAVID BELCHER
Weezer, Weezer (Geffen)
* If Green Day are the Damned -- ie, pretend-punkers of no lasting
consequence -- then Weezer are a blend of Squeeze and the Stranglers,
ie, neat and thoughtful new-wave songwriters with an ironic vision and
something singular to say.
Leftism, Leftfield (Hard Hands)
* Fashionably blank-eyed dance eclecticism from the studio duo of Neil
Barnes and Paul Daley, utilising reggae toasters and African coasters;
punk-ranter John Lydon and swoony-toned Toni Halliday; pulsing
electro-rhythms; minimalist visions. But be warned: the musical view
from out here in left-field with Leftfield is closer to the heart of the
mainstream than you might imagine.
Conspiracy, Drizabone (4th and Broadway)
* A re-promotion for the debut album by these waterproof contenders in
the M People Mainstream Pop-Soul-Dance Cross-over Stakes. Let yourself
sink into Kymberly Peer's mellow yet bubbly tones. Feel the width and
quality of the arranging talents and musicianly skills of Billy April
and Vince Garcia. Check Drizabone out when they visit the Music Gallery
in Paisley tonight.
Bellbottoms, Jon Spencer Blues Explosion (Matador)
* Barmy Burundi-billy baroque'n'roll single -- extracted from the
JSBE's bitchin' Orange album -- designed to alert Britain to the band's
forthcoming nationwide tour supporting the Beastie Boys. Indeed, you
must wear your bellbottoms with Jon Spencer-style maverick flare on
March 7 when the two combos roll into Glasgow's Barrowland. And, if you
ain't done already got the JSBE's Extra Width LP from 93, get it. Got
it? NB. There's this Jon Spencer and there's wee Johnny Spencer, of
Chelsea and Scotland. Both of them, given half a chance, will rip your
rigging in twain.
FOLK
Compiled by ROB ADAMS
The Connachtman's Rambles, Martin O'Connor (Mulligan)
* Originally released in 1979 and available for the first time on CD,
The Connachtman's Rambles was a belter of a first album. Accordion and
melodeon are not fashionably associated with iconoclasts, but there are
few more exciting sounds in traditional music (or any music) than
O'Connor's instantly recognisable, highly percussive style really flying
through a jig, reel or hornpipe with that curious mixture of abandon and
respect for the music. Nor can many other musicians bring such depth of
expression to a slow air. Colm Murphy (bodhran), producer Gerry O'Beirne
(guitar), and Donal Lunny (cittern) give occasional judicious
encouragement, but O'Connor can catch fire all by himself.
Live, Oige (Lochshore)
* Recorded in August 1993, Oige's debut CD is something of an instant
curio. Here they show undoubted potential (listen to Cara Dillon's
disciplined singing and hear why De Dannan are rumoured to be her next
employers) whereas recent concerts confirm that they have already
progressed, especially in terms of arrangements and group interplay on
the jigs and reels, 'way beyond the standard displayed on this
suspiciously demo-like affair. Historically interesting but better
things surely can't be far away.
Up in the Air, Jonny Hardie and Gavin Marwick with Davy Cattanach
(Lochshore)
* A meeting of the fiddlers from The Iron Horse and Old Blind Dogs
plus the latter's percussionist/guitarist, this selection of mostly
Scottish tunes, many of them learned from ''dusty books'', is the
proverbial game of two halves. A sameness about the percussion work and
a lack of real individual bite spoils the up-tempo tunes which are
easily eclipsed by slower tracks such as The Rejected Lover and the
opening sequence of Rob Roy MacGregor where the playing is altogether
warmer and more considered with a character all of its own.
FURTHR READING
Mornings In The Dark: the Graham Greene Film Reader, edited by David
Parkinson (Penguin, #12)
* Witty, perceptive, deftly-written reviews of movies whose celluloid
long ago crumbled. According to Greene, a professional movie-watcher in
the years 1935-40, Herbert Wilcox's films provided ''almost everything
except life, character, truth . . . instead we have flags, anthems,
leading articles, a tombstone reticence''. Yet who now remembers, let
alone watches, the films of Herbert Wilcox? Faintly damning one film you
can still see, The Wizard of Oz, Greene intriguingly identifies it as
''an American drummer's dream of escape''. Heck -- I knew there had to
be a reason for my always having wanted to beat them pesky Munchkins
over the head in 4/4 time! But while Greene's reviews dominate 378 of
this tome's 700-odd pages, Greene's first-hand involvement in films
provides, in the form of his essays, lectures, and interviews, the most
lasting insights into cinema as an art form and a business.
DAVID BELCHER
Classic FM: the Magazine (Issue One, March, #2.20)
* Classic FM joins the glossies. The legions that listen to ''the
world's most beautiful music'' on the soaraway classical station will
flock to this new monthly magazine, which, I suspect, will easily hold
its own in a competitive market. Issue one (just out), packed with
browser and reader material, includes a good bash at opera critics (not
this one, whew) and articles on the classical musicians who worked with
the Beatles during the sixties (remember the high trumpet in Penny
Lane?), Sir Georg Solti, Menuhin, Tippett, Neil Kinnock (eh?), and many
more. Includes lifestyle features on travel, food and drink, and
gardening. Plus profiles of Classic FM presenters and vouchers to use as
discounts for CD purchase. Good value.

What you see in the new Prague is not always what you necessarily get,
as Carl MacDougall was to find out the hard way.
PRAGUE has a changeable climate. Winter visitors are advised to pack
light clothes. Mild and freezing weather can alternate, often within the
same day. Summer visitors are urged to take a raincoat in case of
sunshine and squalls.
So much of this city is interchangeable. So much is reminiscent of
home; yet the visitor's immediate discovery is that there is a Czech way
of doing things, a method that usually defies logic or means things
aren't done at all.
While the Czech Republic rushes to embrace Western values, the old
thinking remains charmingly intact. Nowhere is the new Prague more
openly evident than in its fashionable and venerable coffee-houses. Ask
for kava, Czech coffee, and you will generally be given something like
Turkish coffee, strong enough to be served with water accompaniment.
Coffee-houses will rarely serve such a common drink. In these you can
order espresso, cafe Russe, or coffee variations other than kava, at
suitably fattened prices. When your order comes, it is kava and a glass
of water.
Other attempts at sophistication end in the belly-flop. The city's
official guidebook tells how things were as long ago as 1990: ''Since
then we have got a new phenomenon in our city, and we hope the permanent
one: the freedom''. It goes on to apologise for their present,
transitional state. ''Prague lives through the time of precipitate
development of private activities, commerce and the life in town is
extremely, sometimes even too dynamic. We start from zero. The services
are not perfect at all, but, believe us we do our best so that you can
say very soon: It is worth to see Prague.''
From here the text descends to nonsense, but the meaning is obvious.
There are areas where the transition seems complete, but as with most
things in Prague, there is more than one surface and what lingers below
is at least as relevant as what can be seen.
There is literally a city below the city, Prague's medieval remains,
abandoned when the town was raised to combat the river Vltava flooding.
In the Jewish cemetery, behind the Old Town Square, part of the Jewish
Quarter which Hitler wanted to preserve as the living museum of an
extinct race, the cemetery lairs are 12-deep. Even the tombstones are
overcrowded.
The Old Town Square has been the heart of Prague since the thirteenth
century, when the Vltava flooded and fortifications were established.
This was the focus of medieval life, the start of the Royal Way. Now
known as Nerudova after Jan Neruda, the father of Czech realistic
literature, this was where Czech kings began their coronation
processions, meandering from the square, through the tight little
streets and lanes, across the river at Charles Bridge, carpeted and
rising like a stairway up the hill to Prague Castle and St Vitus's
Cathedral.
This was where executions, jousting tournaments, and markets were
held, where a daily market takes place still. This is a square dominated
by eighteenth-century baroque facades. If one climbs to the top of the
Town Hall tower and looks across the red-tiled roofs, Gothic originals
linger behind the facades. The square is closed to traffic, but tourists
must be wary of the horse-drawn carriages.
This is where the Jan Hus Monument sits near the church of St Nicholas
and the Tyn Church rises behind cream and golden baroque facades. Hus
was executed in 1415 for preaching ideas similar to those Martin Luther
used to inspire the Protestant Reformation a century later. ''Truth will
prevail'' is etched on the side. Nowadays the steps are awash with
back-packers and map-readers. Praguers point out the Jan Hus statue has
seen Hapsburgs, Nazis, and Stalinists come and go.
Tyn Church is being renovated. It could do with a clean, is obviously
loved, run down, and in the middle of repair. It is used by an older
generation. St Nicholas Church has been a concert-hall, a Russian
Orthodox and Czech Hussite churches. It has an architectural prominence
that was never intended, and is usually viewed from an open grassed area
at the opposite end of the square.
For many, this is the essential Prague, the essential contradiction,
the visual statement of a city's character. It is round the corner from
the Astronomical Clock, where a huge crowd gathers on the hour to see
the Twelve Apostles circulate from windows at the top. It tells the old
Bohemian time, calculated from the moment of sunset, as well as Central
European Time, gives the signs of the Zodiac, the stars moving round the
earth -- it was built in the fifteenth century -- tells whether it is
day or night, which most folk can tell anyway, and has Prague at the
centre of the world.
The grassed area was created when the Nazis set fire to the Old Town
Hall, the day before they left in May, 1945, at the end of a week when
5000 Czechs died in the uprising, and just before the Soviet Army
liberated the city. It is something of a compromise. Since the end of
the war, city authorities have been trying to decide what should replace
the part of the hall that was lost. A monument to Stalin was favoured,
but he died as plans were being drawn up, so they grassed the area and
deliberated.
It is filled with picnickers and sunbathers in summer and is an
eyesore in winter. The authorities recently asked for suggestions about
what should be built there. Like most other anachronisms in Prague, it
seems fine the way it is. They have come to accept it.
Prague is a wonderful, infuriating city, where six or seven centuries
of architectural styles exist on a single street, ending with a concrete
mausoleum, a gift from their most recent ideological incumbents. I asked
why one especially hideous example had survived, filthy and unkempt, but
obviously in use. The man shrugged. ''Why should we change it? We have
other buildings which are better.''
The attitude begins at the Ruzyne Airport. The crown is not tendered
on the international money markets, so visitors have to change money as
soon as they arrive. It is a crash course on the art of queueing.
A regular bus service runs to the city centre and costs around 50p.
''Or you could take a taxi,'' the official said. I asked how much a taxi
would cost. The girl shrugged. ''Maybe 15 dollars,'' she said. ''Who
knows? Get a price before you start.'' Prague taxi drivers seem to form
the most audible and voluble section of the Czech Republic's new
entrepreneurs. All taxis have meters, though some drivers forget to turn
them on, especially if you have just arrived and are journeying from the
airport. Others activate the meter, then produce a list of additional
extras when they reach your destination.
Generally speaking, taxis are unnecessary while public transport is
running. Prague has a cheap, reliable, and efficient public transport
system that covers the city and beyond, using subway, buses, and
tramcars. They have, of course, their own way of managing the system.
Tickets must be bought and stamped by passengers before boarding.
Vehicles are patrolled by plain-clothed inspectors who can issue hefty
on-the-spot fines.
A high-speed bus service runs from the airport to the centre of
Prague, as quick as any taxi. To know this one must have asked the right
questions, then stand in the proper queue. The city terminal is less
than a mile from Wenceslas Square, near the main Cedok office, the Czech
tourist centre.
Here an extremely helpful staff will provide explicit directions to
wherever you want to go, or change currency at an advantageous rate or
help find accommodation. This being Prague, they answer one inquiry at a
time, a habit which is repeated at railway stations, bus terminals, and
so on.
Prague has to be explored on foot, with a sense of discovery that
cannot be found elsewhere. To turn a corner and find the Estates
Theatre, where Don Giovanni was first performed, or the little room in
Golden Lane where Kafka worked, to experience the separate character of
the Central Prague's six quarters, especially Mala Strana, the most
secretive part of the city and the best place to escape the tourist
throng, is to feel part of a city that is more than an aggregate of
people, streets, and buildings, a place that has been defended for its
own sake.
Prague has more Art Nouveau buildings than Paris or Vienna, and is one
of the great baroque cities of Europe, closer to us than Vienna or Rome.
This is where Milos Forman filmed Amadeus. It is like a film-set itself,
with an exuberant street life. Musicians as diverse as a string quartet
or jazz band, a hurdy-gurdy player, or a South American folk group are
positioned just outside each other's range. Everything else is in
between: puppeteers and sword-swallowers, snake-charmers, dancers,
acrobats, gymnasts, a dog-handler, and a troop of Hare Krishnas offering
sweets.
A tape recorder is almost as essential as a camera. Music is
everywhere, on the streets, all day. One survivor of the old system is
the handbills, advertising concerts in eccentric locations. Often
outdoor, open-air affairs, you are asked to move on if you don't have a
ticket. And Central Prague itself is an open-air market where
innumerable young folk with trays of diverse goods stand around looking
bored or chatting. No-one tries to sell you anything.
The Prague way of exasperation and helplessness has become the theme
of Czech writers from Kafka and Hasek to Hrabal and Klima. Helplessness
and paradox have become a way of life, elevated to an art form. This has
helped the Czechs resist ideological imperatives.
Having abandoned a rigid ideology, they seem to be rushing headlong
into another. In five years Prague has become a recognisable, Western
city, now clearly part of consumer Europe. They seem to be expecting a
new ideology to replace the one they have abandoned and are disappointed
when we say it won't happen.
Why not? They've got McDonalds and Coca-Cola signs, open prostitution,
and a very free market. Their currency is none too strong, inflation
seems endemic, unemployment is rising, but they have come through worse
and survived. ''Isn't that what's meant by being capitalist?'' someone
asked me. Poland is a couple of years down the road and has re-elected
the old guard under a new guise. And Czechoslovakia voted itself into
communism.
The ultimate paradox is that Prague survived because it was ruled by a
clique of single-minded politicos dedicated to progress. It is now run
by people dedicated to preserving the past.

It may take Tennent's new ale almost three minutes to settle, but as
Andrew McKay discovered, following in the footsteps of Bonnie Prince
Charlie, it was well worth waiting for a touch of Velvet.
EXPERTS of brewing industry aroma may have noticed a slight change in
the sweet smell that hangs over Glasgow's East End on a damp evening.
But those who fear the head man may have gone off his malt and is
meddling with the lager and ale recipes at Tennent's Wellpark Brewery
need not worry.
The latest heavenly bouquet introduces two new beers to the market.
They are Tennent's 70/- Velvet Ale and Aitken's 80/- cask ale. Head
brewer Neil Talbot and his team have taken more than a year to develop
these brews to meet the needs of an increasingly judicious drinking
clan.
Cellarman visited the Heritage Centre at the brewery for a bijou
tasting session recently, and found much to his liking. Wellpark has
always had an air of intrigue about it. And walking through the brewery
grounds, past an arsenal of barrels, firkins, and kegs, huge steaming
tanks propped up like missiles on a launch-pad, the factory is an
unintended but ideal set for a James Bond movie.
Tennent's 70/- Velvet Ale is not too dissimilar to its stablemate,
Aitken's Ale, a lower-gravity keg beer. The Velvet follows a fashionable
course where time taken to pour is seen to equal quality.
In Velvet's case, 22 seconds seems not too bad. However, it takes a
further two-and-a-half minutes to go from a white-foam consistency to a
deep golden-red colour ale. Perhaps lager drinkers with an inquiring
mind may slip in a pint of their favourite while waiting. Velvet has an
ABV of 3.5% and does keep its head all the way down the glass.
Aitken's 80/- Cask Ale is the company's other new brew, so named to
celebrate the Aitken connection with Scottish brewing since 1740. It is
the first cask ale to be brewed at Wellpark in 25 years, and will find
favour with those who appreciate cask-conditioned beers. With an ABV of
4.2%, this 80/- is of the deep copper hue, has a refreshing mix of
bitter and sweet flavours, and a slight hint of Ovaltine taste gives it
a late-night appeal.
Among the taster celebs was Bonnie Prince Charlie who, it is claimed,
visited the brewery about 250 years ago. On that occasion he and his
troops had returned from England after being put to flight by Johnny
Cope. According to the tale, they were ''refreshed and heartened'' by
the hospitality. They might have been more successful in their ambitions
had they visited the brewery first and taken some supplies with them.
The company dates its birth from 1556 when Robert Tennent, a private
brewer and maltman, was known to be a member of the Incorportation of
Maltmen. In its history, Tennent's became the biggest exporter of
bottled beer in the world, and were pioneers of the lager-brewing
industry in this country in the late nineteenth century which, at the
time, was considered a ''madman's dream''. Lager sales have so
flourished that today the brewery is able to can 2000 in a minute.
A new corporate logo focuses on 1556 and will replace the famous red
T, which will appear only on lager cans. But still not a lager lovely in
sight. The new beers are now available in Tennent's pubs and will make
their debut elsewhere as they spread across the country, east to west,
by mid-April.

Wild places and poetry are an author's true loves, as Lesley Duncan
discovers
JIM CRUMLEY gets about. Notably up mountains and among islands. A
passionate advocate of Scotland's wild places, he has an ever-growing
corpus of books on the theme. His latest two are titled, appropriately,
Among Islands and The Heart of Skye.
Crumley is a rangy big man with gaunt features and a northern roll
tohis Rs (though he comes from Dundee). He talks as he writes, with an
intensity and seriousness offset by pleasant, self-deprecating humour.
What is he doing at the moment? ''Resting,'' he replies. But he has a
contract to do a companion volume about Mull. ''And there's a novel.
It's looking for a publisher. It's called The Mountain of Light and it's
actually set between Stirling and Ben Ledi. It also takes in my
enthusiasm for swans and trades on the old swan myths. It has a
conservation message: nature is good for you!''
Cape, for whom he's done three wildlife books, considered it, but his
editor there said he simply didn't understand it. ''Wonderful
passages,'' Crumley quotes him, ''but for Christ's sake what does it
mean?'' So the book is ''doing the rounds''.
Crumley got into a poetry anthology last year. It contains the work of
''a loose organisation called the Shore Poets, based on Edinburgh.''
Most of his books, from the first, St Kilda, have featured poetry. ''It
allows you to say something which might sound a bit pretentious if you
simply put it into a paragraph of prose. I think I'm quite clinical
about my approach to poetry. George Mackay Brown -- a hero of mine and a
great stylist in poetry -- is very blunt about this. All you're doing is
making something which is no more difficult and no easier than a
carpenter making a table -- and no more mysterious either.''
The love of Scottish landscape and wildlife is the common theme of his
books. Would he have the same response, say, to the Andes or the Urals?
''I went to Iceland recently, making a television film about swans. That
kind of landscape I have no difficulty in waxing, boringly, lyrical
about. I don't think I could ever go gaga in a rain forest.''
He obviously has a tremendously sensitive love of nature, but
sometimes seems to be intolerant of other people on the hills. Was he in
a position to stand in judgment on his fellow men? ''No, not any more so
than anybody else,'' Crumley replies. ''I think a lot of people have
lost, in the last 30 years or so, the quality of the going.
''We've got to the stage where things like outdoor education are
stuffed on to the school syllabus. It denies the opportunity of learning
about wild places instinctively, and by degrees. That manifests itself
in so many ways now. The purple anorak is a manifestation of it. The
fact that people go in mob-handed expeditions is part of it.
''The standard I set myself -- and the one that I would love other
people to set themselves -- is that when they go into wild places they
leave no trace of their passing. That's the highest compliment you can
pay to nature.''
Like many another, Crumley came to full-time authorship through
journalism. Growing up in Dundee, he gravitated naturally to D C
Thomson's. Twenty-four years later, after having held a variety of
increasingly senior jobs on Scottish newspapers, including The Herald
and the Edinburgh Evening News, he left journalism ''to try and write
the things I wanted to write and to have a go at writing books''.
After the ''conspicuous milestone'' of his fortieth birthday, he came
out of newspapers with four publishing contracts. ''I've never had four
publishing contracts since!'' he laughs ruefully.
Over the decades he has found time to keep playing jazz on his guitar.
This Shadows fan has played in many groups -- ''some of them made money
even''. He's currently pondering books (unlinked) about his home city of
Dundee and wolves.
His attitude to the most powerfully symbolic of wild animals, not to
mention land usage in the Highlands, may be typified by his comment on
Rum in Among Islands. ''Unleash the wolf there by all means and let it
be free there. It has been a long, long time since anything so wise and
compassionate and tolerant as a wolf was top dog on Rum.''
This nature man is no wolf-lover in sheep's clothing.
* Among Islands is published by Mainstream at #14.99. The Heart of
Skye is published by Colin Baxter at #8.95.

THE way in which the mighty Stuart dynasty sank from being
all-powerful monarchs, self-appointed representatives of God on earth,
to a bunch of international fugitives, is a sobering lesson for any of
us who get that wee bit uppity, or ''bigsy'' as we might say here in
Orkney.
This remarkable reversal of fortunes is well illustrated by two very
different journeys undertaken by members of the family a century apart.
The first was a glittering state visit to Scotland by James VI in 1616
(despite promises, the only one of his reign as King of Great Britain
and Ireland) and the second a rustic adventure in the backwoods of
France undertaken by his great-grandson, the Auld Pretender, James VIII,
at the start of the 1715 uprising.
James VI came north against the advice of his English counsellors who
felt his time could be better spent. Preparations for his visit had
begun the previous year with repairs to the palaces of Holyrood and
Falkland. The Privy Council ordered that clean lodgings should be
prepared for the king's party, the streets ''purified'', beggars chased
and beasts fattened so there would be an ''abundance of flesh''.
But no royal visit is free from controversy. The fitting out of the
Chapel Royal at Holyrood with a new #400 organ and wooden statues of the
Apostles caused a ''murmuring'' among the people who, we are told,
feared a great alteration in religious practices. As a result the
bishops persuaded James to stash his wooden effigies in a cupboard.
There also seems to have been reluctance among Scottish Protestant
craftsmen to assist in upgrading the chapel. Eventually some St Andrews
slaters who refused to work were ''put to the horn'' as rebels.
Three months before the King's arrival the Market Cross of Edinburgh
was completed and work was proceeding apace with renovations and new
building at the castle.
On May 13 the royal party, which included the Duke of Lennox, the
Earls of Arundel, Southampton, Pembroke, Montgomery, and Buckingham, the
Bishops of Ely, Lincoln, and Winchester, and sundry hangers-on, crossed
into Scotland, staying two nights at Dunglass, the castle of the Earls
of Home, near Cockburnspath.
The third night was spent at Seton within sight of the Scottish
capital, and on the Friday, passing through Leith, James abandoned his
coach and took to horseback so that as he entered Edinburgh ''he might
be better seen by the people''. A summary of the on-the-spot reports
indicate he was splendidly welcomed with speeches, poems, golden
testimonials, and cannon salvoes from the battlements of the castle.
The fun was quickly over, however, because the following day a service
in the English style was held at Holyrood and it ''required the utmost
efforts of the magistrates to restrain the inflamed passions of the
common people'' over what they saw as ''the dregs of Popery''.
James, however, undaunted, continued his grand tour. He hunted in
Forfarshire, visited Dundee, Perth, Stirling, and St Andrews, and went
down a coalmine at Culross. Glasgow, Hamilton, Paisley, and Dumfries
were next on the itinerary and he crossed back into England on August 5,
to the ''general regret'' of his subjects.
Contrast this grand affair with the sad plight of the Auld Pretender
nipping around Normandy between broken-down inns often soaked to the
skin and perhaps worst of all finding the local cider rotten. We'll see
just how far the mighty had fallen.

The shooting of a visitor has done nothing to harm tourism in Cambodia
-- or so officials would have us believe, says Kirsty Scott.
DESPITE the fatal shooting of an American tourist last month,
Cambodia's Ministry of Tourism has gone on a bizarre PR offensive to try
to persuade visitors that the country ''is now safer and more attractive
to investors and tourists than at any time in the past 20 years''.
In a statement issued recently, the ministry tried to play down the
impact and implications of the death of Susan Ginsburg Hadden, a
49-year-old University of Texas professor, during a visit to the Angkor
Wat temple complex on January 15.
Hadden was in a caravan of tourists travelling to one of the more
remote temples in the complex when bandits ambushed them. She and her
Cambodian tour guide were killed, and her husband, James Hadden Jnr, was
seriously wounded. Ten people were arrested for alleged involvement in
the attack, and were arraigned before a judge at the end of January.
The Ministry said many westerners had gained ''the wrong impression''
about Cambodia from publicity over the killing.
The ministry statement said the number of visitors to Cambodia had
increased to 178,000 last year, up 49% from 120,000 in 1993, and that
more than 45,000 people last year visited Siem Reap province, where
Angkor Wat is located.
It also noted that the Raffles Group of Singapore recently had signed
a #20m contract to renovate and expand Siem Reap's classic Grand Hotel,
and that two other foreign-funded hotel ventures worth #15m are being
developed.
The statement quoted Hadden's husband as saying he did not blame the
authorities for the killing. It claimed he had apologised to them on
several occasions ''for causing trouble and inconveniencing them,
especially on a weekend''.
* IT'S unclear what the impact on Turkey's beleaguered tourist trade
will be following a report by Amnesty International which said human
rights violations in the country are raging out of control. The report
came a week after a similar document was produced by the US State
Department.
Both reports detailed a variety of alleged abuses including
disappearances, forced evacuations, destruction of villages, and
torture. Amnesty called for foreign governments to tighten controls on
arms and other military equipment sent to Turkey.
* THE Lake District has been raking in awards for its tourism
accommodation and facilities, beating out some of the top destinations
in the south of the country.
The small Linthwaite House hotel, with 18 bedrooms, has been awarded
the English Tourist Board's England for Excellence Hotel of the Year
award, against competition from such a heavyweight fellow finalist as
London's Hyde Park Hotel.
The Linthwaite sits in 14.5 acres of hilltop grounds at Bowness,
overlooking Windermere lake. Manager Mike Bevans leads a staff of 15
with traditional values and excellent customer care. Golf, watersports,
the renowned lake steamer trips, and the literary trails of Wordsworth
and Ruskin have combined with the hotel's own romantic packages and
Beatrix Potter small breaks to pull in customers since Handmade Hotels
took it on in July 1990, increasing turnover year on year. Linthwaite
(05394 886600) is rated 4 crown deluxe.
Cumbria also took the Leo for Bed and Breakfast Guesthouse of the Year
with Pickett Howe, Buttermere Valley, near Cockermouth (3 crown deluxe),
once a dilapidated farmhouse and opened four years ago, offering just
four double bedrooms.
Silver awards went to the Manor House (2 crown deluxe), at Rylstone
near Skipton, with two guest rooms, and Middle Ord Manor House, near
Berwick-upon-Tweed, with three double bedrooms. To crown Cumbria's
success in the awards, the Furness and Cartmel peninsulas took the
Holiday Destination of the Year Leo statuette for the area's variety of
natural and historical features, including the Laurel and Hardy Museum
at Ulverston (Stan Laurel's birthplace); the Dock Museum in the
shipbuilding town of Barrow-in-Furness; South Lakes wild animal park;
and the Edwardian seaside resort of Grange-over-Sands.
Brochures and literature on this area are available from Southern
Lakeland, Furness and Cartmel Tourism, The Old Brewery, Ulverston LA12
7HX (0229 580742).
Top in the Where to Visit category was Warwick Castle, which scored
with sheer majesty as Visitor Attraction of the Year over the hugely
popular Blackpool Pleasure Beach and the comparative newcomer, Denbies
wine estate, Dorking, Surrey, both of which took silvers.
With a 200-year history of being open to the public, Warwick is
currently owned by the Tussaud group and widely regarded as the finest
medieval castle in England. Yet today it is well into what is officially
described as ''enhancing the total visitor experience on an ongoing
basis through continued quality improvements, customer care, and
enhanced value''. What this means in English is that it offers a large
choice of attractions spanning 1000 years of history at an all-in price.
* VISITORS to Sweden can look forward to a new breed of friendly and
relaxed bus drivers, courtesy of a new scheme which pays drivers to get
rid of their stress by meditating instead of berating innocent
passengers or driving aggressively.
The Stockholm bus authority is offering its drivers a 40-hour long
''Richer Life'' course of meditation to ease the strains of city
driving.
Hans Schneider, traffic chief of the authority, said many drivers had
complained of stress-induced headaches, stomach aches, and stiff
muscles. The voluntary course, which includes meditation and lifestyle
seminars, is offered during paid working hours and financed mostly
through a state grant.
The course also includes role-playing, in which bus drivers take the
part of angry passengers.
* MEANWHILE, the owner of Canada's largest reindeer herd is looking
for a buyer to take the 2000 animals off his hands. William Nasogaluak
says financial problems have forced the sale. He thinks the herd, based
on a barren wasteland near the ice-covered Beaufort Sea, might be used
as some sort of tourist attraction.

Almost everyone else has been able to see the attractions for years
and, after searching high and low, Deirdre Chapman too finds that
Scotland's poignant past is only a stone's throw away.
IT IS mildly sustaining at this time of year to look at a map of
Scotland. Those gaping estuaries, those crocodile-skin mountains. The
clean diagonals of the fault lines, the excesses of the Atlantic coast.
The artistry of the whole thing balanced on England's stout pedestal and
its fell-off-the-back-of-a-lorry position relative to Europe and Asia.
What a strange place. And we live there.
How different it feels from the country I grew up in, when it seemed
that a life sentence of cock-a-leekie soup, lace hankies, and lovat
cardigans with elbow patches was the certain lot of all those not joined
by birthright to a large landmass. A landmass where you could get on a
train and keep going across plains of rolling tumbleweed or be halted at
night sidings by frontier guards with sauerkraut on their breath shining
torches in your eyes and finding fault with your papers. The redundancy
of nostalgia. As the world turns, mass loses glamour, tumbleweed gets
sprayed, plains get six-lane highways, and inked-in borders begin to
fade. For distance we take to the air. Scotland, the place that sent the
Romans homeward to think again, is looking exotic. Not just the
Highlands -- they were always too easy on the eye to be truly domestic
-- but the Lowlands too.
Our history, always a great depressant, holds an undeniable poignant
chic for outsiders and, as distance grows from the events, for us too.
This year is the 250th anniversary of the Jacobite Rebellion when Bonnie
Prince Charlie landed at Eriskay, raised the standard at Glenfinnan,
then criss-crossed the country raising a great awakening of local
tourist boards who are arranging commemorative events from Falkirk to
the Hebrides. But older, more fragile, less documented history has equal
charm to an introspective nation and lets us see a familiar countryside
with fresh eyes.
Learning to see the Lowlands as an exotic leisure destination is my
new hobby. It is not their lowness that we hold against them so much as
the deeds of those sober improvers, the James Watts, the
Massey-Fergusons, the William Lows, whose good works can be as garlic
flowers to the spirits of the place. Here and there it is necessary to
fill in with background reading, deploy the imagination, blot out later
buildings, and respect the gardens and farmland where historic bits and
pieces are located.
In the village of Burghead on the Moray coast, a curio of gridiron
planning in a wild coastal setting, there is a deep well with steps
leading into the ground where the Picts are suspected of having done
more than draw water. Inside the well chamber is a platform. The Pictish
method of execution was by drowning. This is not a place you sling a
bucket down; its whole posture invites entry.
Whether you peer at the well through the locked gate behind someone's
house or go and find the lady who keeps the key, you have plenty of
imaginative licence and not a soul around to break the spell. When you
walk to the end of the gusty headland where waves crash below the
vestiges of a massive fortification overlooking a wild and desolate
seascape you are seeing all that remains of a whole promontory fortified
by the Picts -- a Caledonian acropolis. The harbour on the north side
yielded six dressed blocks inscribed with the royal bull symbol, all
that remain of the 31 mentioned in records when the site was cleared for
the construction of a model village in 1805. To this day a January fire
festival in the village recalls pagan rituals from a time before written
history.
Everything about the Picts is dark, chimerical, mist-swirled. They
hang on the cusp between ancient paganism and early Christianity,
throwing down a faintly Spielbergian challenge to decode a lost history
inscribed only on tablets of stone. Our ancestors.
For a go-it-alone early spring break with a difference you could put
together your own Pictish stone-hunting trip, dependent on neither
weather nor opening times since most of the exquisitely engraved stones
are out in the landscape. They sweep up the eastern half of Scotland
from the Tay to Sutherland and beyond to Orkney and Shetland. In
Morayshire the tallest, Sueno's Stone, 6.5 metres high, depicts a battle
scene and stands on the seaward side of Forres, just a few miles from
Burghead.
Further south the rich farmlands of Angus hide some of the most
surprising stones among farm buildings, churchyards, and manse gardens.
Aberlemno, barely a hamlet on the B9134 Forfar to Brechin road, has two
superb wayside stones, but go down to the old churchyard on the banks of
the Lemno Burn to see one of the most famous, the cross-slab that is
thought to depict the nearby Battle of Nechtansmere where the Picts
halted the Anglian advance in 685 AD.
A few miles away in Glamis, human legs wave from a cauldron on the
back of the Manse garden cross slab. Heads hang from a tree at nearby
Eassie Priory. Barbaric? The carving is sublime, sometimes bossed in an
imitation of metalwork, often supported by intricate harmonious borders
or fanciful or realistic animals and birds. Recent thinking is that the
Book of Kells may have been the work of Pictish artists in the east of
Scotland, perhaps at St Andrews. Arm yourself with Anna Ritchie's
excellent illustrated HMSO publication The Picts and Historic Scotland's
Visitor's Guide to Scotland's Heritage. (There are more complex works in
bookshops if you get hooked.)
St Andrews Cathedral museum houses the St Andrews sarcophagus, one of
the finest examples, St Vigeans outside Arbroath has 32 early Christian
Pictish stones in a cottage museum, while Meigle museum in Perthshire
has one of the finest collections of Dark Age sculpture in Europe. Those
last two are open from March 1 and April 1 respectively.
Pictish parts also tend to gaunt sea-cliffs, fortified keeps, and old
churches. The stone in the south is red, as in Arbroath's power-packed
Abbey, and if the ruins lack the milky limestone elegance of those of
vine-growing countries, you are certain to be amused by their ferocity.
There is a palpable sense of long habitation, an ancient crop cycle,
many feet passing, that replaces the sparse fragile beauty of the west.
Small market towns, huge fields, and, on the practical side, the bonus
of comfortable country-house hotels which offer good low-season rates.
Knockomie Hotel outside Forres is close to Burghead and Sueno's Stone.
The luxurious Castleton House at Glamis has the Glamis, Eassie, and
Aberlemno stones on its doorstep and some of the best food I've ever
eaten. Farmhouse B&amp;Bs are another option.
Inland, the Angus glens bear into the Grampians to reach often
spectacular dead-ends against rock faces, and are surprisingly little
known outside the area. Glenesk, where Macbeth fled, culminates in the
ruins of Invermark Castle guarding dark Loch Lee. Glen Clova has the
atmospheric Clova Hotel at its head, just before the Munro-sized walls
close in at Glen Doll. Glen Prosen is where Captain Scott planned his
South Pole expedition. Only Glenisla, merging with Glenshee, cuts all
the way through the mountains to Deeside. At Edzell the intricate
seventeenth-century walled garden of the old Lindsay stronghold has the
internal walls engraved with the Cardinal Virtues and the Liberal Arts
as befits the Lichtsome Lindsays' slack reputation for esteeming culture
above the arts of war.
Heading north along the Kincardine coast, Dunnottar Castle is one of
the most spectacularly located castles in Scotland, looming out over the
sea on a severed rock platform clothed in sweet grass and with a
freshwater well at its heart. In Cromwell's time the Scottish Regalia
was taken here for safe keeping and, the castle under siege, smuggled
out in the apron of Mistress Grainger, the minister's wife of Kinneff,
through the gate where the historic feet of Mel Gibson's Hamlet were
later to tread. South lie the fishing villages of Joan Eardley's
paintings, east is Sunset Song country.
The best approach to Deeside (neolothic barrows and a crannog in Loch
Kinord) is to ascend the narrowing river valley from nearby Banchory,
turning your back on the coastal plain, and now is the time to do it
before the tour buses crowd in to that most visited of culs-de-sac.
In Braemar, perched below the Arctic Tundra of the Cairngorm plateau,
the Heritage Centre is one of the best interpretive centres in the
country, strong on the clan system as well as flora and fauna, and open
all year. But that is Highland. North and east, where the Lowlands are
still just hanging on, is the unfrequented option of the enigmatic Tap
o' Noth near Rhynie in Aberdeenshire where a vitrified hill fort
extending to 50 acres once enclosed some 200 timber roundhouses,
possibly the encampment of the Pictish tribes who united to turn back
Agricola's 83 AD expedition at Mons Graupius.
Leaping into recent light history there is the curious forgotten spa
of Strathpeffer, all fountains, white paint, and perpendiculars, close
by the Viking settlement of Dingwall, both on low ground but dominated
by the great northern mass of Ben Wyvis which finally closes off the
coastal plain. Nearby Contin has a wonderful refuge in the stylish Coul
House Hotel with its octagonal lounge, a sample of the architectural
grandeur of that area.
Pictish remains, of course, go right up and over the sea to Orkney and
Shetland, and I hope before long to follow them. My husband spent the
first 10 years of his life on the Shetland island of Whalsay gathering
seagulls' eggs (for eating) from the sea cliffs and carrying home peats
from the communal bank. His graphic recall of the small boat crossing
from the mainland has so far discouraged me from seeing for myself, but
the cottage he lived in is one of several that Shetland Tourist Board
has recently converted into bothies for summer visitors in places too
sparsely populated to run to hotels. The Viking settlement of Jarlshof
in Shetland is lucidly described in another HMSO publication, Invaders
of Scotland (which also features the Roman occupation of Bearsden).
You'll find Orkney's Pictish Skara Brae in The Picts.
For such a small country Scotland is full of surprises. Take
Clackmannanshire. It shadows the central belt yet you may very well go
to the grave without having set foot in it. Last year for the first time
I turned off the Stirling to Tay Bridge road towards Dollar and followed
the signs for Dollar Glen. A revelation. As you climb you emerge from
douce Lowland to dramatic Highland scenery. Here, the hand that drew the
Highland Line wobbled, recovered, and continued, but not before it had
created the Ochils, high enough to have a cap of spring snow, a
population of rugged hill sheep and, in the steep outcrop on which sits
Castle Campbell, formerly Castle Gloom, between the Burn of Care and the
Burn of Sorrow, as mountainous a setting for a fortified keep as any
further north.
Back down to earth and passing on through the straight line of the
Hillfoots towns, the high Ochil ridge keeps pace with the road, sweeping
up so steeply from it that you can almost picture an Alpine way of life,
everybody heading uphill in April when the new grass arrives to settle
into summer sheilings where their cattle may graze and their grannies
sit knitting on rocking chairs, gazing out across the great populated
ribbon of Scotland's striving economic heartland. There is a mill trail
here linking the small towns.
The little town of Clackmannan was deserted when I visited but for the
Clack of Mannan, elevated upon its stark pillar, in the empty square by
the tolbooth. The Clack, a stone of unknown origin, was sacred to the
pagan god Mannan.
The vast green plain upon which Stirling sits with the Forth
meandering across it and the Wallace Monument rising like a spear never
fails to astonish me. I used to wonder why so many historic encounters
happened hereabouts -- Bannockburn, Stirling Bridge -- in a site so
conveniently levelled. Only when I read Michael Lynch's Scotland, a New
History did I discover that all this was once a dangerous tidal reach
known as the Sea of Scotland surrounded by impenetrable marshland which
virtually cut Scotland in two along the line of the Forth except for the
crossing at Stirling.
Scotland is full of amazing one-off places. The village of Fortingall
in Perthshire, remarkable enough already with its thatched houses,
estate buildings, and remote but favoured setting, is also the reputed
birthplace of Pontius Pilate and the site of the oldest tree in Europe.
Stop at the church and read all about it.
Then there is Crieff. On the Lowland side of the line but, in
aspiration, definitely Highland. Stuck up on top of a hill that makes
walking a nightmare for the affluent elderly of its substantial garden
terraces. Surrounded by alternative space, miles of it, moorland, glens,
pasture. Whenever you pass through Crieff its pavements are crowded with
preoccupied people scurrying by like the population of a fortified
medieval city state under siege. All around, nothing. I have never heard
a proper explanation for Crieff.
There comes a time in the the Highlands, which coincides with most
visitors arriving, when we must leave the main roads in search of little
places. Argyll, with a longer coastline than France, most of it rocky,
has more secret inlets, poetic ruins, rhododendron forests, fairy
mountains, talking stones, cup and ring markings and hermit's cells than
is really fair.
For prehistory, the concentration of chambered cairns and stone
circles around Kilmartin Glen is superb. The Bronze Age Templewood stone
circle has a fine explanatory display, as does Kilmartin Church which
houses the Kilmartin Cross. Dunadd, rising out of the flatlands of the
Great Moss, once an inlet of the sea, has the mystical aura of its past
as ancient capital of the Scots Kingdom of Dalriada as well as cup and
ring markings, a footprint, and a Pictish boar carving.
Two places of haunting beauty and spine-tingling spirituality are
thirteenth-century Kilmory Chapel on the south shore of Loch Sween
overlooked by Jura and sheltering the Macmillan Cross, and, in a
secluded wayside setting, Columba's cave on Loch Caolisport close to the
village of Achahoish. Here in a creeper-hung cliff face opposite a small
bay is an inhabited cave with a rock shelf, altar, basin, and carved
crosses where it is thought that Columba stayed on his visit to the King
at Dunadd. There are many excellent hotels in Argyll, notably the Crinan
Hotel and the Loch Melfort Hotel, equally renowned for their coastal
settings and their menus.
As the days lengthen longer trips north become more justifiable. One I
have yet to do is the Pass of the Cattle, the dizzy road from Kishorn to
Applecross, but I can commend the stomach-churning Torridon to Diabaig
road. Some of the most outstanding scenery of all is here in Wester
Ross, those fragments of the ancient forest rising alongside Loch Maree
and the ancient horizontal rock formations of Torridon. The Earl of
Lovelace's former shooting lodge, which is now the Loch Torridon Hotel,
is a haven of good food and log fires. Then, when the sun is high enough
to warm that naked rock, open the water-lilies, and dye the lochans
inky-blue, there is the west of Sutherland, too exotic, surely to be
ours at all.

Paul Young knew he would have a good day on the Tay but never dreamed
he'd end up with the catch of many seasons.
A GREY misty morning below Dunkeld. The river running high, but clear.
Hardly a sound save the occasional swish and swirl of water over some of
the large boulders in midstream. A green woodpecker arrows its way
across to the far bank where Tony, the gillie, points out a red squirrel
foraging in the leaves for a bite to eat.
The three anglers, Ricky, John and myself, in high good spirits,
indulge in the usual banter. We draw for places in the boat and agree to
change over at lunchtime. Ricky has forgotten his neoprene waders, great
for keeping us warm at this nippy time of year, so we all look out our
extra bits and pieces of cloth for his stunt in the boat. He ends up
looking like the Michelin Man. Or should I say more like the Michelin
Man than usual!
Tony looks at all our baits and, in the usual way of Tay gillies,
decides that not one of them is worthy to be used on his excellent bit
of water. He delves deep into how own tackle-bag, making sure that none
of us is privy to its secret recesses, and brings out the killers. These
are the baits for this water, he says, and is about to return them to
the bag. It is only after threats, and the realisation that three
against one might result in a gubbing, that he relents, picking
attractive lures for the boat rods and giving John, who was to be
fishing from the bank, one of the black and white devons that had taken
the first springer from the beat a few days before.
That was our goal. A springer. A salmon, new in from the sea, on its
way to the headwaters of the Tay system. These days, they are few and
far between. In the past, the Tay was famed for its spring runs . . .
you had to take an autumn week to even be considered for some spring
fishing, but now the tables have turned. The last six or eight weeks of
the season are the most fecund, and the band of spring fishers has
diminished in proportion to the lack of fish. And yet, for me, the
thrill of being on the water during those sometimes coarse, always
challenging days of ''spring fishing'', January to April, has a
particular magic. You might take a couple of coloured fish on a good day
in September, fish which you know in your heart should be returned to
the water, but if you get one fish in January, it is likely to be
approaching perfection. If you get one.
We motored up the river from the hut, Tony at the helm, Michelin Man
and me. We set on to the harl on the Tronach, a delightful pool, with
eddies on either side of the main stream and lots of places where you
thought fish might be lying. Tony held the boat beautifully against the
stream. The baits, approved by, tied on by, and on loan from Tony, were
working well. The rod tops were ducking and diving as the baits scoured
the lies, but to no avail. So we dropped downriver to the Green Bank.
We came in to a beautiful bit of water. Tony told me to let out six
turns of the reel. Having always been of contrary mind, I demurred and
suggested five-and-a-half. This was met with the opinion that I was, and
had always been, a difficult . . . person. I put the rod in the holder.
Ricky was in the process of letting his lure out the requisite length,
when my rod thumped down and a fish was on.
Now, we all reckoned that it was likely to be a kelt. But since mine
was the outside rod, working the bait in the fast water, there might
just be a chance. Tony held the boat, the other rods were brought in and
we waited with bated breath. The fish came upstream towards us slowly
then turned and screamed off across the river. We were under the right
bank and the fish suddenly cartwheeled out of the water towards the far
side.
''A springer,'' we all shouted. And I can tell you how I felt. Weak at
the knees, the hands, the brain. This was the most sought after prize
for the angler, and there it was 40, 50, 60 yards away and I had no
control. Tony took the boat quickly downstream and across and I slowly
gained some semblance of control. We beached the boat and Tony and I
followed the fish as it used the current of this mighty river to ease
downstream. In the air, the fish had looked big -- 12, perhaps 14
pounds.
When, knees still weak, fingers trembling and brain still scrambled, I
managed to bring it to the net, I was surprised at the size of it. Tony
lifted the net, and there was my first springer for many years. On the
scale, it weighed 17[1/2] pounds. My biggest ever spring salmon.
In the fishing hut at lunchtime I kept leaving the soup to make sure
the fish was still lying on the doorstep. I was one of the few in the
world who had taken a Tay springer in the first week of the season. I
know that harling from the boat is a bit of a lottery, and that it could
just as easily have been Ricky or John who was celebrating. But it
wasn't! So I reiterate . . . see me, see the Tay? I just love it.

Hugh Ouston continues his ascent to the Pinnacles of Liathach.
I HAVE been afraid of Liathach for 20 years. The first time I drove
down Glen Torridon, my friend from Skye unrolled its name with the
dreadful hollow where its middle consonants should be. The guidebooks
were sonorous in their admiration and warning. ''Climbers who know this
great mountain will agree that it is the mightiest and most imposing in
all Britain . . . The traverse is a considerable undertaking and is for
the experienced climber rather than for the ordinary pedestrian, by whom
it should be severely left alone.'' Well, we had just experienced enough
to severely try it. It was the day after Ben Alligin and the weather
looked grey but the great arrowhead of pale grey quartzite was free of
cloud.
We started up the newly made path on the steep slopes to the east of
Glen Cottage. There is no walk in, just a walk up. Even on the easy
parts you see your companion's boots rather than anything higher. Past
the burn in Coire Leith the path steepened and we hoisted ourselves
through yet another crumbling stair of sandstone and across the first
convex slope, just the last few yards to the ridge. We had come up the
easy side. The north walls were invisible below us. To the west the
screes showered over both sides of the ridge.
The walk towards the summit is airy and narrow, with Beinn Eighe over
your shoulder and the wilderness of Fisherfield beyond Slioch to the
north. I tried to savour it, honestly I did, but I knew that behind me
was a descent I would rather avoid and in front were . . . pinnacles.
Another shock is the size of the silvery scree that caps the mountain:
20-foot blocks jumbled at 45 degrees. At least the sense of vertigo was
eased.
We had asked everyone about the pinnacles, trying to get the measure
of them against our skill and nerve. The replies were monotonous: ''Have
you done the Aonach Eagach?'' My companion could not even get his
epiglottis along its consonants let alone his Vibrams along its rock. I
knew a little more but remained uncomforted.
Now there was nothing for it. We worked our way down to the narrow
neck of grass that leads out from the summit cone to the first rocks. A
heave and a scratch and we were walking on a six-foot platform above a
2000-foot drop. A scramble down and up a few more times -- and then the
pinnacles actually began.
What makes the first big face frightening is not the hand and
footholds which in this dry weather were adequate; it is the way the
dominant line swings gently out over the corrie until you are doing the
final 50 feet of a vertiginous rock climb.
After 15 feet my companion came back down. Like me, it wasn't the
present situation that scared him, it was what might be next. I was
relieved. The rock was hard but fear is a very hard place place indeed.
If we were to die we were determined it would not be through failure of
the imagination.
It was the same when Brenda Macrow climbed Liathach in 1947:
Black, crumbling rock. Dead scree. The dolorous wind
that wails among the chimneypots of hell.
Cloud smoking out of corries. Crooked teeth
set loosely in the wizened gums of earth.''
Wondrous kind indeed. Yet what used to make my palms sweat was the
description of the only alternative route, a scarcely less exposed path
on the southern terraces. While a father and his eight-year-old son
clambered up the face we had just turned from, we tiptoed round the
buttress and stepped out along a perfectly level path that twisted round
the foot of the rocks. It was 18 inches wide and we could see our car
3000 feet below -- and about two inches beyond my left boot. We walked
slowly round the heads of vertical gullies. In a few hundred yards the
path rose up to meet the ridge at the far end of the pinnacles.
The faint echo of regret that we had chosen an easier option was
drowned by Handel's Messiah of relief. The traverse was ours; the wind
had died completely and the sun illuminated a Parnassian green ridge
ahead, set above a silver, Scottish sea. Behind us two ravens played
about the chimneypots of hell, cheated once again.
The walk along the cliff edge to Mullach an Rathain, the western
summit, is clean and easy. All the terrors of the mountain are to the
east, so long as you are not tempted by the northern pinnacles, which
are as safe as a tower of marshmallows. We stayed as high as long as we
could, and the ridge strides broadly towards the sea for another mile or
two. By the time we picked our way down the patches of cliff to the
woods of Loch Torridon our legs were glutinous.

It's the end of the road for the eighties, and it's only 1987. There's
something amiss, says David Belcher
TOMORROW night's final episode of Time Of Your Life, Scottish
Television's examination of the sights and sounds of the eighties,
focuses on 1987 -- and yes, let's state here and now that we trust that
the prematurely truncated series will return in the autumn for an
augmented re-run which will include the decade's two missing years, as
has apparently been mooted in the corridors of power down Cowcaddens
way.
So what happened in 1987? Most tragically, the Zeebrugge ferry
disaster happened, killing hundreds in the North Sea. Anglican
negotiator Terry Waite was taken hostage in the Lebanon. Rioting
prisoners staged rooftop protests at Barlinnie. And when the smoke had
cleared and the ballot had been tallied in the General Election,
Scotland was saddled with a second successive Tory Government, despite
an overwhelming vote for Labour north of the Border.
And most alarmingly for us fearless probing members of the fourth
estate, the Special Branch had decided that BBC Scotland couldn't
transmit the Zircon tapes, a progamme based on revelations made in the
New Statesman by journalstic prober par excellence Duncan Campbell.
Looking far from special -- No bullet-proof camouflage gear! No
bazookas! No battering-rams, crampons or balaclavas! -- the Special
Branch staged a raid on Beebus Scotia's Queen Margaret Drive HQ.
Actually, staged a raid is overstating it a bit. They just politely
walked in and out of the Beeb's front door, carrying away impounded cans
of film in plastic bags. And what was so earth-shatteringly secret about
Zircon, whatever Zircon was?
Was it a highly-confidential spy-in-the-sky satellite station? Was it
a new form of treatment for cold sores? I don't know -- or if I do, I
can't tell you officially, if you get my drift (nudge, wink). Write to
Ian Lang and ask him.
So let us merely be thankful that the censorious plods didn't get
their hands on BBC Scotland's Tutti Frutti, John Byrne's hilarious
rock'n'roll epic starring Robbie Coltrane and Emma Thompson.
Of authentic rock and genuine roll, there seemed all too little in the
charts in 1987, despite the Proclaimers' wondrous revelation of their
existence with Letter From America. Mary's Prayer, by Danny Wilson, was
pleasant enough, despite the suspicion that Steely Dan had done it
better more than 10 years before.
Deacon Blue droned on about dig-ner-tee; the Wets wished themselves
luckiness. Lester Piggott could reckon himself luckiest. Jailed for tax
fraud, he didn't have to listen to either of them.

Margaret Hughes takes the opportunity to combine two loves and finds
that while there is much to sustain shoppers, there is room for
improvement in in-store cafes.
I AM a bit of a veteran when it comes to eating in restaurants in
department stores. This is mainly because I am a bit of a shopaholic and
have travelled far and wide in search of a bargain, and a good cup of
coffee to celebrate or commiserate the state of the sales.
The truth of it is that there are some in-store restaurants that are
good, but a lot of them are bad, offering nothing more than chips with
everything and iced doughnuts.
One of the better ones is the Marks &amp; Spencer restaurant at
Gateshead's Metro Centre -- for M&amp;S food junkies, this is heaven. It's
M&amp;S food that you don't have to cook for yourself. I mourn the fact that
M&amp;S haven't seen fit to replicate the idea all over the country.
So with this yardstick in mind I visited a selection of in-store
restaurants and got very mixed results.
The cafe in Boots, on Edinburgh's Princes Street, has a wonderful view
over the castle, which goes some way to making up for being a bit
cramped. This is a self-service operation, and the counter appears to
work quite well, with no major snarl-ups as customers waited for soup or
hot beverages to be served.
The menu is quite extensive, if a little predictable. There are
salads, sandwiches, a selection of hot meals and several types of cakes
and desserts. Most interesting was the branding of various items on the
menu as low-fat or low-calorie.
Specific items were either ''Shapers'', which is calorie-controlled,
or ''Vita'', which means the dish is made up of ''foods containing
ingredients that are naturally high in vitamins'', and which provide a
certain percentage of the required daily allowance of vitamins and
minerals. This included the use of wholegrain breads, chicken, and tuna.
My chicken salad sandwich was neither, and was very mediocre. There
was a lot of salad and not a lot of chicken. It was also very cold and,
because of this, not pleasant to eat. The passion cake was a dry,
mass-produced disappointment. The tea, on the other hand, was most
enjoyable, served in a delightful little teapot.
If you are on a diet then this would be a good fuelling stop during a
shopping trip; you could delve in to calorie-controlled sandwiches or
desserts. Otherwise there are better alternatives, although that view is
hard to beat.
At Jenners, Edinburgh, there are five restaurants to choose from. The
Princes Street Restaurant, which is situated next to the Food Hall, has
wonderful views. Unfortunately the Fifth Floor restaurant does not boast
such views, but the standard of the food is good.
This too is a self-service counter and the choice is impressive. Some
of the highlights of the menu are prawn and cucumber cheesecake, a good
selection of cold meats and salads, smoked salmon served on a croissant,
fruit flan, and ice cream sundaes.
There are several main-meal options, mostly of the predictable
lasagne, chicken curry, and fish sort. I couldn't resist one of the
dishes of the day -- ''prawns provencale''. Basically it was prawns
served in a tomato-based sauce and accompanied with rice. The sauce had
a good chunky texture and would probably have gone better with pasta
than rice, but it was so refreshing to see something a little bit
different on offer.
The coffee was excellent, served in a cafetiere. There is even a
choice of blends, which is not something I had expected in a
self-service restaurant.
Although most of the customers appeared to be shoppers, there was a
sprinkling of men and women in business suits.
Usually I don't like self-service operations, they can get so fraught,
but in Jenners' Fifth Floor Restaurant the service was good and much
quicker than having to wait on orders being taken and then served.
The Next Cafe, in Glasgow's Argyle Street, is also self-service.
Customers have to form a queue at a check-out and order their food from
there, but there is nothing that actually tells you to do this. There
were several confused customers, myself included. It also gets very
congested at busy times as the queue winds its way out of the cafe area
and spills into the menswear department.
Fortunately the food does make up for it. The cafe is open all day and
so there are breakfast items and afternoon tea selections; at lunchtime
it is the standard soup, sandwiches, salads and pasta. However, these
are not predictable dishes -- main courses include broccoli and
cream-cheese pie and two-cheese pizza. There are also baked potatoes and
filled rolls. There are around five fillings and these can be served in
baked potatoes, granary rolls, or sandwiches.
So, you can have cheese and pickle in a potato, or chicken tikka in a
lime yoghurt dressing on a granary roll. For value for money the soup
and sandwich combination is a good idea and the portion sizes are
generous. The children's menu is the same as the grown-ups', only the
portions are smaller. It was good to see children tucking into
sandwiches and salad.
There is a choice of cakes and scones, and these include the usual
passion cake and chocolate fudge cake.
For a quick snack the Next Cafe is good. It does get a bit crowded at
busy times and it should be a little bit keener to let customers know
just how they are supposed to get served.
There's no problem with getting served at the cafe in Fraser's
department store in Perth. This is a self-service operation that runs
smoothly and is well-staffed.
Unfortunately, the menu is back to the predictable soup and a roll,
chips with the main meal, and cream cakes for dessert. The dish of the
day was moussaka, served with chips, so I decided to give it a try. It
was quite unlike any moussaka I'd ever tasted before -- there was a
profusion of courgette and aubergine, but the dish resembled lasagne
more than moussaka and lacked any real taste.
The baked potatoes, on the other hand, looked quite tempting and were
available with a choice of fillings, the chilli was proving to be quite
popular and, given that it was served with salad, would probably have
been the better choice to make.
The filter coffee was reasonably good, and because so much of it was
being served, it was not getting the opportunity to lie on the hot plate
and spoil.
Desserts were made up mainly of fresh cream cakes, lemon meringue pie,
and chocolate fudge cake, but did not look tempting.
This restaurant was not as cramped as some of the others and the
service was very friendly.
Eating in department stores is a bit hit-and-miss. Certainly each of
these restaurants had something to commend them; unfortunately it was
not always the food.
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
* Minsky's New York Deli &amp; Restaurant, The Glasgow Hilton, 1 William
Street, Glasgow. Tel: 041 204 5506.
This American-style diner within the Glasgow Hilton Hotel offers an
extensive menu and US-size portions.
For real value for money, try the buffet, where there is a good
selection of roasts, fish, and as much salad as you can fit on to your
plate.
Desserts are sumptuous sundaes and cheesecake that really comes all
the way from the USA and is wonderful.
Regular theme nights offer a chance to try food from around the world.
Up-and-coming themes include Spanish, Mexican, and Asian cuisine.
* Ostlers Close, 25 Bonnygate, Cupar, Fife. Tel: 01334 655574.
Ostlers Close is a delightful little restaurant that has gained a big
reputation over the last few years.
The menu uses good Scottish produce and leans towards fish and
shellfish; indeed, these dishes are always very good. But there is also
a good choice of beef, lamb, and game available. Its seafood soup must
be tried.
Desserts are of the traditional, homemade sort and the service is
welcoming and friendly.
Loon Fung, 417 Sauchiehall Street, Glasgow. Tel: 041 332 1240.
It's often said that if Chinese people eat in a Chinese restaurant
then it must be good. Well, Loon Fung must be one of the best, because
it is usually packed.
The style of cooking is Cantonese and the menu is huge and reasonably
priced. It includes a choice of more than 30 different kinds of dim sum,
which are served as starters or a light meal.
Seafood seems to dominate the menu, but there is also duck, lamb, and
chicken. Vegetarians are also catered for with a number of choices and a
set dinner made up of several courses.

IN the early days of television, the boob tube was carefully disguised
as a piece of furniture in a veneered cabinet. Even as late as the 1960s
the wood look was favoured. Then, as the black box aesthetic appearance
took over, the brown cabinet disappeared.
However, it is still possible to buy mock Chippendale cabinets that
conceal your screen so you can pretend to be one of those ''smart''
people who don't watch the box.
Modern TV sets tend to be soulless, a uniform of black or grey plastic
shell housing a menacing, mechanical Cyclops. But that's about to
change. Philippe Starck, French maestro of modern design, has come up
with a product bearing one of his classic witty names. Jim Nature is a
14-inch, portable colour set designed for French manufacturer Saba and
now available in Britain.
It looks for all the world like a piece of protective packaging into
which someone has dropped a TV screen. The case is made from recycled
wood chips bonded with formaldehyde-free glue. The internal parts can be
dismantled easily and are labelled for sorting and recycling. The whole
look is of green, eco-friendly. Even the plastic knobs are green and use
environmentally correct paint.
Starck describes Jim Nature television as ''a travelling companion, a
buddy who does his job with an awareness of the problems of the planet.
It is made of non-matter, sawdust, in order to cost the earth as little
as possible and live in harmony with nature''.
However, within the homespun package come all the essentials -- access
to cable channels; on-screen graphics for sound, brightness and other
controls; programmable sound and picture settings; and an electronic key
that prevents its use with the remote control.
The maker talks of investing his product with ''a personality, a
soul''. Certainly it would look perfect in some lonely garret, artist's
studio, or bachelor pad.
* The Jim Nature television costs #299 and can be seen at Nice House,
Princes Square, Glasgow.

After clearing out the larder in a pre-Lenten purge, Catherine Brown
and illustrator Fiona Taylor conclude their series with fillings for a
few tasty pancakes.
IN THIS last Worldly Palate the feasting is almost over. Just a final
pre-Lenten clean-out of rich eggs, butter, and cream before the
much-needed fast. A simple stir of the batter, a deft toss of the pan --
and you have a pancake. Provided of course that your tossing skills are
more accomplished than the TV cook who tossed her pancake so high that
it stuck to the studio lights and never came back down.
Children love tossing pancakes. I mean, of course, the wafery thin
variety -- English pancakes, or French crepes -- which you toss by first
sliding to the edge of the pan, and with the pan tilted down, flip over
with a short upward movement of the wrist. Teach children how to do it
and you will have no peace.
In pancake culture, the Scots make a thick pancake on a girdle which
you can't toss. Also the Scandinavians, who use a cast-iron pancake-pan
with special round indentations for making thick pancakes at speed. A
pancake party for them is piles of pancakes served with pots of jam made
from forest berries like cloudberries and wild brambles along with bowls
of sour cream.
It's a tradition which depends for its success on the way they make
jam, which is not as a firm set, but as a runny syrup for using as a
sauce rather than a spread. Thick-set UK jam of the extra-fruit variety
is a reasonable substitute: the pot emptied into a pan and heated up
with enough water to make a syrup.
In Holland there was no jam with the smallest pancakes I've ever
eaten, just butter and icing sugar. At the pancake stall in the market
place a continuous pancake-making feat was performed by two men over a
smoking hot-plate with hundreds of little round indentations the size of
a 50p piece. As we queued for our bags of poffertjes they poured batter
into the holes and tossed the tiny pancakes by spiking them over with a
deft flick, before stacking in piles of a dozen a time.
The Americans also stack their pancakes. ''Tall'' or ''short'' stacks
of giant thick Scotch pancakes are teamed up with enough variations on a
theme to keep the whole restaurant kitchen busy just making pancakes. If
you are a purist you will order a pile which has been buttered and
drenched on top with maple syrup and finished off with a pile of crisply
fried streaky bacon.
It is the French, Austrians, Czechs, Poles, and Hungarians, however,
who are the serious pancake inventors, with their subtle and complex
recipes made with thin tossable pancakes, layered and rolled with
fillings and sometimes made into elaborate tortes. Though they all like
to think of themselves as the originators of the pancake, the truth is
that the thin round cakes of grain and water cooked on a hot hearthstone
can be traced back to the early Egyptians, who passed on the habit to
the Romans whose armies brought pancakes to Europe.
There is surely nothing more skilled at cloaking itself round a
clamjamphrie of unused food than a thin pancake.
FRENCH FILLED PANCAKES
Crepes Fourrees Gratinees (approx 16):
5 oz (150g) plain flour
3 eggs
1 cup (8floz/250ml) milk
4 tablespoons water
half a teaspoon salt
1[1/2] oz (40g) butter, melted and cooled
oil and pastry brush for greasing the pan
Filling: 12 oz (350g) mushrooms, finely chopped
2 oz (50g) butter
2 oz (50g) spring onions, finely chopped
1 tablespoon parsley, finely chopped
salt and freshly ground pepper
approx 8 oz (250g) cooked meat, fish, shellfish, or vegetables
Veloute sauce: 3 oz (75g) butter
2 oz (50g) flour
1 pint (500ml) stock or water
2 egg yolks
1 cup (8floz/250g) double cream
salt and pepper
lemon juice
1 oz (25g) mature Cheddar, Parmesan, or Gruyere cheese finely grated
Method: Crepes: Stir flour and eggs together and gradually add the
milk, salt, and butter. Use enough water to make it the consistency of
thick pouring cream. Or blend all the ingredients in a blender for a
minute. Leave in a cool place for about an hour.
Heat a 6" crepe pan over a high heat and grease with oil.
Pour in enough batter to just cover the base and cook for a minute.
Toss, and cook on the other side for half a minute.
Continue with the rest of the batter. Pile up on a plate. They may be
cooked in advance and wrapped in clingfilm.
Filling: heat the butter in a pan and add the mushrooms, cook until
soft. Add the spring onions and parsley, seasoning, and cooked meat or
fish. Season.
Sauce: Melt the butter and add the flour, cook for a few minutes.
Gradually stir in the stock or water. Bring to the boil and simmer for a
minute. Mix the eggs and cream in a bowl and add some hot sauce. Return
to the pan and bring slowly to a gentle simmer, whisking all the time.
Remove from the heat and season with salt, pepper, and lemon juice.
To finish: Stir about 4 tablespoons of the sauce into the filling
mixture, season. Spread about 2 tablespoons on each pancake and roll up.
Pour a layer of sauce in the base of a large baking dish and put the
filled pancakes on top. Cover with the sauce. Sprinkle cheese on top and
bake 375F/190C/gas 5 for 20 minutes. Brown lightly under the grill
before serving.

GENTLEMAN SPY: The Life of Allen Dulles By Peter Grose.
Andre Deutsch, #20.
WE HAVE Rudyard Kipling to thank for Allen Dulles and the CIA. In
1914, Dulles left university and set off on his first expedition abroad.
On the way to India he read Kim and discovered Kipling's definition of a
spy: ''From time to time God causes men to be born -- and thou art one
of them -- who have a lust to go ahead at the risk of their lives and
discover news.''
For the next 55 years Dulles pursued the Great Game with the zeal of a
man who knew he had God on his side. When he died in 1969, a copy of Kim
was found at his bedside.
Allen Welsh Dulles was America's Cold Warrior. History has paid more
attention to his older brother John Foster, who served as Secretary of
State under Eisenhower, but it was Allen who built the Central
Intelligence Agency.
As its director from 1953 to 1961, Allen Dulles presided over the
greatest scandals of American foreign policy, from the overthrow of
Mossadegh in Iran to the failed Bay of Pigs invasion. What Allen
justified as the life-or-death struggle against Soviet imperialism, a
generation of liberals would later evoke as proof-positive of America's
nefarious influence on world events.
Dulles was the son of a Presbyterian minister. He was born into the
privilege of East Coast Establishment connections (his grandfather was a
noted Secretary of State). At Princeton he made the contacts that would
serve him for the rest of his life.
First as a diplomat, then as a lawyer, Allen's early career gravitated
quickly to the top of America's foreign-policy establishment. His
greatest lesson as a spy came in 1917, at the age of 24.
As a young diplomat passing through Berne in Switzerland on Easter
Sunday, he took a call from a mysterious Russian emigre requesting an
urgent meeting. Dulles, late for a tennis date with the daughter of a
Swiss friend, refused. The meeting would have to wait until Monday. Too
late, the Russian said.
The next morning a sealed train left Switzerland for Finland Station,
and Dulles spent the rest of his life recounting how he missed a chance
to meet Vladimir Ilich Lenin. Thereafter he stressed to his pupils the
importance of returning every phone call and taking up every chance to
meet someone new.
Dulles spent the Second World War in Switzerland, running agents in
Nazi Germany. He tried to help the plotters against Hitler, and passed
on some of the first evidence of the Holocaust. Afterwards, with the
Cold War intensifying, Dulles was instrumental in making the case for a
combined civilian-led intelligence body.
What emerged became a force with unlimited power. And with right on
its side, as defined by the moral imperative of the struggle against
Communism, the CIA embarked on a decade of covert operations which, when
made public, caused untold damage to America's image abroad.
The great and the strange of Cold War history all have a part in this
excellent book. Dulles seems to have met most of them, often in
unexpected circumstances. In 1949 he took a liking to the new MI6 man in
Washington. The American spymaster failed to spot a traitor, and years
later, in Moscow, Kim Philby would reminisce fondly about their drinking
sessions.
Dulles, whose fondness of England was formed with the appeasers of
Viscount Astor's Cliveden set in the 1930s, remained a committed
Anglophile long after the humiliations of the British secret service.
Late in his career he became a fan of James Bond, and asked Ian Fleming
for advice on getting rid of Castro. Fleming recommended using chemicals
to remove Castro's beard.
Peter Grose's enthralling biography is elegantly written and teeming
with anecdotes. He has succesfully avoided the pitfall of judgment with
hindsight awaiting every biographer.
Instead, he has laid out the facts in meticulous detail for the reader
to assess. Even the sad details of Dulles's constant philandering are
treated with sensitivity. This is a supremely readable work of scholarly
distinction.

THE RIDERS
Tim Winton.
Picador, #14.99.
TIM Winton has his back to the camera. The author's picture on the
dust jacket shows a plaited pigtail hanging midway down a leather
jerkin. It looks like something generated in the publicity department;
but, giving him the benefit of the doubt and assuming that more than
crude gimmickry is at work here, the effect is to focus the reader's
concentration on the text, to clear away any extraneous influences.
It could, of course, be a gesture of contempt. Then again, maybe he
thinks his pigtail is his finest feature.
Thankfully, the text is more interesting. Winton has constructed an
elaborate plot round a simple device, twisting the structure rather than
the story to accommodate his intentions. The contrivance is the search
for a missing person, a storyline that has been around for so long and
has appeared in so many guises that simple discovery is often no longer
enough to sustain the narrative.
Winton is clearly aware of his predecessors and uses the device not
only as a means of self-discovery, but also to establish family ties,
utilising the early stages of the book to lay out the loneliness and
insularity of a character who appears to have found himself through
marriage.
Fred Scully, his wife Jennifer and daughter Billie, are Australians
touring Europe with no specific itinerary or intention. Scully falls in
with Mylie Doolin in London. For a while they work together, and though
Scully never discovers Doolin's IRA connections, memory brings him to
Ireland.
On impulse and in the wake of the Eniskillen bombing, he and Jennifer
buy an abandoned two-up, two-down house in County Offaly, a house, he
remarks, that is older than his nation. Despite a baby on the way,
Jennifer and Billie travel back to Australia to tie up the family's
affairs.
Scully stays to work on the Irish house, which is more or less where
we find him, alone in an alien, cold, and hostile landscape. He is
helped by Peter Keneally, a red-haired postman who carries gossip around
with the mail.
Keneally talks of the Troubles and Scully talks of his family. Details
of Scully's life are established through his conversations with
Keneally, who always seems like a stranger in the narrative, as if it is
he and his countrymen who are out of place in the landscape, that Scully
is their caretaker, restoring something the locals left to rot.
This is because the early pages have a conversational feel. The style
tries to be colloquial and intimate, never losing sight of Scully. There
are times when he could be addressing the reader directly. ''Man, he was
low this morning,'' and ''God, he missed her,'' can refer to only one
person.
Apart from Scully, everyone else is a cipher. We discover Ireland and
other locations through his eyes. Keneally gives him someone to talk to
and he talks about himself and his family.
By the time he reaches Shannon, the plane has landed and Billie is
alone on the concourse. She is too traumatised to talk to her father or
tell what happened. Her mother has abandoned them both. So far, all we
know about Jennifer is that she is a beautiful woman who married beneath
her. It now seems she is the only person who can unite Scully and his
daughter.
Scully hauls Billie across Europe, back to where they've been,
revisiting their stops in a vain attempt to find a reason for the
disappearance as much as for traces of Jennifer. He and his daughter
become increasingly alienated and the focus of the narrative becomes
their reconciliation and bonding. We lose sight of the woman who makes
the pairing necessary.
The main problem is that everything is written in the same breakneck
style. There is little or no variation in language or character, and
even though Scully finds himself, his life, and the love of his
daughter, he is essentially the same person and Billie's future is
remarkably vague. The quest ends because Scully reaches a point where he
cannot continue. It has provided the impetus and nothing more.

THE PHYSICS OF IMMORTALITY: Modern cosmology, God and the resurrection
of the dead.
Frank J Tipler.
Macmillan, #20
PEOPLE who set out to write books that purport to solve the mysteries
of the universe and discern the mind of God should first open the Book
of Ecclesiastes, whose world-weary wisdom is an antidote to the
pomposities and vanity to which such people can so easily fall prey.
Frank Tipler is a professor of mathematical physics in the southern
United States and begins, immodestly, with the claim that when he became
a cosmologist 20 years ago he was an atheist and never imagined that the
central claims of the Judaeo-Christian religion are true and are
''straightforward deductions of the laws of physics as we now understand
them''.
Why am I, a card-carrying minister of the Kirk, not jumping with
delight at the chance to claim scientific respectability for my faith?
Well, because I have more faith in the modest claims of faith than I do
in the somewhat overblown claims of this book.
The author describes it as a ''popular'' work, having isolated all the
complex mathematics to an appendix that consists of one third the size
of the 530-page work. Nevertheless, the remaining two-thirds is an
unreadable mish-mash of cosmology, amateur biblical scholarship, and
philosophical scavenging.
A great part of the latter is concerned with the Omega Point Theory,
credited to astrophysicist Freeman Dyson but developed originally by the
Jesuit and palaeontologist, Teilhard de Chardin. Tipler dismisses
Teilhard's work as anachronistic in the world of new physics, but
contends that Dyson also makes wrong assumptions.
He goes on to create his own version of Omega (which turns out to be
shorthand for God), who will turn out not to be a formula, but a process
by which the matter of dead humanity, after going through the mill of
thermodynamics, will be reassembled in an ultimate form that is
personal. Hence his startling conclusion that the resurrection of the
body and the life everlasting is not a wild hope, but the bottom line of
his celestial mathematics.
It would be nice if it were true, but Tipler does not do enough to
convince me, and to make the claims he does about theology as a branch
of physics he has to do a little more. Certainly, the new physics has
ushered in many books that no longer treat religion and science as
mutually contradictory systems.
Best known of these is Stephen Hawking's work that tends to an
atheistic position; but his ex-wife, who contributed to it, is a
believer. John Polkinghorne, a former physicist now an Anglican priest,
has contributed salutary work in the field of theology and science,
having taken us far from the old ''god of the gaps'' which gave religion
a bad name among scientists.
However, if religion scored own goals by inviting people to take leaps
of faith over the gaps in their knowledge that were eventually filled
and made religion look somewhat foolish, scientists such as Tipler have
done likewise for science by inviting his readers to do a somersault,
swallowing the Apostles' creed as they go.
It used to be a bit of a joke that scientists could feed data into a
computer and come up with God as the answer or pace Douglas Adams-42.
However, on p335 Tipler writes: ''To test the Omega Point theory, we
will need the Tevatron upgrade and either the SSC -- the Texas
supercollider -- or the European LHC. The latter two machines are quite
expensive. But perhaps it will be worth several billion dollars to
establish that God exists and that one day we will be resurrected to
live forever with Him/Her.''
That's not so much faith in science as faith in his own theory -- what
Ecclesiastes would describe as ''vanity of vanities''.

THEATRES OF MEMORY: Volume 1, Past and Present in Contemporary
Culture.
Raphael Samuel
Verso, London &amp; New York
IT is very easy to sneer at the World of Heritage (I have been guilty
of it myself). That modern, popular culture represented by theme parks,
costume dramas, reproduction pub mirrors, and other manifestations of
''retro-chic'', along with the interpretations of the past organised at
such places as New Lanark and the Jorvik Centre, can seem ridiculous,
vulgar, and false. Above all, vulgar. Many have attacked modern
Britain's obsession with heritage and the past: some have made an
industry out of it. Now, an unlikely but powerful defender of
backward-looking popular culture has emerged in the shape of the
professional historian Raphael Samuel.
The critics of ''heritage'' (the word, alas, is unavoidable) accuse it
of not only being a symptom of a national lack of confidence, but a
con-trick by the recent Conservative Governments allied with all the old
enemies of the Welfare State, Young Fogies, and the beleaguered owners
of expensive country houses. Samuel will have none of this.
Although certain aspects of the heritage industry are big business, he
points out that most nostalgic enthusiasms well predate Mrs Thatcher's
election victory and that, indeed, the prime movers have so often been
Labour-controlled public authorities: ''Heritage and its allies have
arguably given a new lease of life -- and a new visual form -- to what
used to be called, in the 1890s and 1900s, when it found expression in
municipal libraries, swimming-baths, and bandstands, the Civic Gospel.
It is one of the very few areas in which local government can still take
a lead, and almost the only one where public-sector employment has
increased.''
Samuel also notes that the rise of the heritage industry coincided
with the collapse of two-party class divides and that the ''popularity
of heritage'' may be because ''it is an attempt to escape from class''.
What, indeed, impresses Samuel is that so many preservationist and
nostalgic exercises represent a genuinely popular interest in history,
and he has no doubt that much of this stems from the disorientating and
destructive utopianism of comprehensive redevelopment in the 1960s,
combined with other social changes.
In consequence, therefore, Samuel sees much of the criticism on
heritage as a form of intellectual snobbery. His book is both a history
of the growth of modern historical consciousness in its widest aspects
(not only the interest in old photographs, but television soap operas
and folk music are considered) and also a powerful attack on
conventional academic history.
His central proposition is that ''history is not the prerogative of
the historian . . . It is, rather, a social form of knowledge: the work,
in a given instance, of a thousand different hands''.
He even dares to suggest that amateur antiquarians, collectors, and
other enthusiasts are as creative as, and contribute as much, or more,
than, rigorously academic historians. ''If there is reason to be anxious
for the future of historical scholarship,'' Samuel argues, ''the
run-down in library services, the break-up of local history collections,
the disappearance of the post of local history or borough librarian, and
the impending reorganisation of county record offices, are at least as
much a threat to research as cuts in postgraduate funding.''
In this wise and rich book -- the first of a projected trilogy --
Raphael Samuel takes on allcomers -- including the right-on ''new wave''
social historians who dismiss dates and battles and are concerned only
with ''ordinary'' people. His credentials are impeccable: lecturer at
Ruskin College, solidly left-wing, atheist, the son of Jewish,
communist, London East-Enders.
For Samuel, the interest in the past -- however absurd, illogical, or
vulgar its manifestations -- is a sign of social health and maturity,
while wilful amnesia and the cult of the new for its own sake are
contemptible. Samuel notes that heritage enterprises not only restore
local pride and improve the quality of life, but also generate income
and employment.

THE LUCID DREAMER: A Waking Guide for the Traveller between Worlds.
Malcolm Godwin
Element, #16.95
KING Elvis almost said it all for Malcolm Godwin when he sang If I Can
Dream and saw the light in the night. He helped others dream more
hopefully, and many dreams died when he did and we were reminded of what
often passes for reality.
''I have a dream,'' said Martin Luther King, announcing his vision of
a richer reality. His vision was blacked out in one day of the American
nightmare and God -- or Godwin in his lucid dreams -- only knows what
King thought of that. Nevertheless, King's dream changed life. All
visionary dreams do if you believe this book about life as a possible
dream.
Small wonder Prince Hamlet had nightmares about dreaming after death.
Big wonder Bill Shakespeare, who dreamed up Hamlet's problems, thought
life defined by dreams and was well puzzled about what would come in the
undiscovered country of afterlife.
Freud, who disturbed the dreams of humankind in The Interpretation of
Dreams (1899) and is criticised by Godwin for his lack of insight into
lucid dreaming, described the dream as ''a wish fulfilment'' and some
dreams are as simple as that. Shortly after the death of Burns, for
example, his widow had a disturbing dream. The bard came to Jean's
bedroom window, pulled the curtains, and talked of family affairs. Jean
was startled by the seeming reality of the dream, but knew her wish was
divorced from reality. She should have known better.
Some dreams unconsciously approach a reality denied to the dreamer.
According to Godwin, who spent seven years in India searching for the
mystical meaning of life, celibates dream mainly of sexual encounters
and dieters dream mainly of food. Their difficulty is in waking up to a
reality they see as another dimension. Godwin says he sees through that.
Lucid dreamers such as Godwin see little difference between dreams and
reality, for lucid dreamers respect the reality of dreams. The lucid
dreamer, Godwin explains, ''is able to take control over who appears and
what is dreamed, and the experience is most often accompanied by a
marvellous and euphoric sense of power, delight, and heightened
faculties''. Lucid dreaming is a state, recognised by Godwin as reality,
in which the sleeper is conscious or he or she is dreaming.
Godwin describes his book as a dream manual, and it comes with a
warning: it is dangerous for lunatics to attempt lucid dreaming. For
non-lunatics, Godwin recommends lucid dreaming as a conscious cure for
the heartache and the thousand natural socks to which flesh is heir. If
you are troubled, make sure you dream about your troubles. Godwin
assures you ''you will find a solution in your dreams''. If, that is,
you believe in Godwin.
Godwin believes in some strange beings. He believes in Gurdjieff as
one of the ''masters of the century,'' though some might dismiss this
self-styled guru as a false God. He believes in Reamana Maharishi as
''one of the most beautiful enlightened beings of the earlier part of
this century,'' though some of us have our doubts about Indian mystics.
He believes in the mystical as a matter of fact.
I believe Godwin is good when he is more matter-of-fact than odd
mystics he admires. He advises conscious dreamers to keep calm, to have
a message before looking for the message of lucid dreaming, to decide on
a positively imaginative dream. He tells dreamers to take note of what
they dream, to keep a journal of what has been disclosed in conscious
dreaming. He is certain that conscious dreams expand the consciousness.
Conscious dreaming increases our awareness of a cosmos which, says
Godwin after invoking Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, alters under
observation. Heisenberg famously observed, in 1927, how it was
impossible to measure exactly both the position and velocity of a
sub-atomic particle simultaneously because the object was disturbed by
the observer. Even Einstein was disturbed by this observation, but
Godwin delights in the thought of a mystical, rather than mechanical,
universe. In his lucid dreams, he imagines mind is always above matter.
What matters to Godwin, above all, is making the mind matter in a
mystical way. His writing reminds me of the books and conversation of my
friend Colin Wilson. Like Colin, Godwin finds it too easy to question
the cosmos. Like Colin, Godwin imposes his beliefs on an area that
remains beyond our Ken or Colin or Malcolm.
Still, we can all dream of solving universal problems and, encouraged
by Godwin, imagine we succeed. This is a book for the New Age -- ''our
new metaphysical generation'' in the words of Godwin -- though it harks
back to old boys like the Buddha. Godwin clearly wants to be the guru of
dreaming and does his lucid best to make the bed a better place. But
readers should sleep on it before accepting everything in this
intelligently assertive and unusually irritating and illuminatingly
illustrated bedside book.

A BUSINESSMAN was found not guilty of smuggling 15,000 ecstasy tablets
-- worth #300,000 on the streets -- into Scotland at the High Court in
Glasgow yesterday.
A jury was told that the drugs and US dollars worth #24,000 arrived
along with boxes of cucumbers for Mr Kan Yiu Tong, 41. However, Mr Tong,
of Birchlea Drive, Giffnock, Glasgow, named former Oban businessman Mr
Gil Lister, as the smuggler.
His defence advocate, Mr William Dunlop, argued that there was no
proof that Mr Tong was connected with the box of drugs, and he was
acquitted.
Mr Tong said later: ''I am innocent and this has been a nightmare for
me.''
He named Mr Lister as the smuggler in a special defence lodged in
court.
Mr Lister sold his firm, Beaver Timber, several years ago and has
disappeared from Scotland.
The court was told that a parcel addressed to Mr Lister's Oban
solicitor last year was found to contain #50,000 in notes when opened by
Customs officers.
A Customs investigator agreed with Mr Dunlop that the money was
eventually handed over to Mr Lister when it could not be proved it was
drug money.

A CHURCH leader yesterday urged Scottish Secretary Ian Lang to resist
any attempts to reduce the age of homosexual consent in Scotland to 16
years.
The Rev William Wallace, convener of the Church of Scotland's board of
social responsibility, reminded him Biblical teaching was that
homosexual acts were wrong and consequently should not be encouraged.
''The law, as it stands, offers some protection to young people who
may feel drawn into homosexual acts during a transitional stage in their
development.''
He has written to Mr Lang, referring to recent press reports,
including a disclosure in The Herald, of a campaign by gay rights group
Stonewall to have the age of consent in Scotland lowered from 18 to 16.
Earlier this week another group, Outright Scotland, lobbied the
Scottish Office for an amendment to the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill
to make the age of consent for gay men the same as heterosexuals at 16.
Mr Wallace said comparison with the age of heterosexual consent was
irrelevant. ''It is set at 16 as that is, for better or for worse, the
age at which couples can be married. It has to do with the propagation
of the human race. Homosexual acts are quite different.''
Mr Wallace concluded: ''As a church we would want to disassociate
ourselves from prejudice against and maltreatment of people because of
their homosexual orientation.''

IT had been his father's wish that he represent him at the naming of
Glasgow University's new veterinary library.
And so, yesterday, the day after his father died, Jim Wight travelled
to Glasgow to open the library, named after James Herriot, the pen name
of the retired Yorkshire veterinary surgeon Alf Wight.
Mr Jim Wight, who runs his father's veterinary practice in Thirsk,
North Yorkshire, told those who attended the ceremony that his father, a
man who spent his life trying to avoid publicity, had taken the
unprecedented step of calling the local Yorkshire newspapers to tell
them that Glasgow University was honouring him.
In his letter to the Dean of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine,
Professor Norman Wright, Mr Herriot wrote last November: ''This honour,
coming as it does from fellow veterinarians and from Glasgow in
particular, is the most cherished tribute which has ever been paid to
me.''
It was in 1939 that Mr Herriot, then known only as Alf Wight,
qualified as a veterinary surgeon from the Glasgow Veterinary College, a
forerunner of the university's Faculty of Veterinary Medicine.
His son followed in his footsteps, graduating from Glasgow in 1966.
Mr Herriot was 78 when he died on Thursday after suffering for the
past three years from cancer of the prostate.
He began writing about his experiences as a country vet in the
Yorkshire Dales more than 30 years ago and his first book was to launch
him on a secondary career as one of Britain's most successful
contemporary authors.
The James Herriot Library was built by Glasgow University at a cost of
#330,000. It seats 120 students, and includes a conference room,
computer links, and video-viewing facilities.

TWO-year-old Jasmine Dodds was yesterday getting to know her mother
again after being reunited in Texas at the end of a two-month separation
because of a custody battle.
Jasmine was taken from her mother, Ms Sarah Dodds, 31, from Forres,
when she was arrested in California in December. She was charged with
abduction after snatching Jasmine from her former lover's parents' home
in Texas.
After an eight-day court hearing at Travis County Courthouse a jury
decided that Ms Dodds and her mother, Forres horse breeder Mrs Flora
Dempster, should be granted joint custody of Jasmine rather than her
father, Mr Marcus Chapman, or his parents.
Three hours later Jasmine was handed over to her mother and they spent
their first night together in the small apartment which Ms Dodds and her
mother have shared in Austin since January. Ms Dodds spent three weeks
in jail in California before being extradited to Texas and released on
bail.
Ms Dodds said last night: ''I am delighted the strain is over and we
are all exhausted but we are going fine. I would be on a plane back to
Scotland in half an hour if I could.''
She could still face criminal charges of abduction because when she
took Jasmine from the grandparents' home during an access visit they had
custody. She also faces a cheque fraud charge which she said arose
because she wrote a $360 cheque unaware that her boyfriend had withdrawn
$2800 after her departure.
''Jasmine has regressed a lot but that is to be expected and she is a
bit wobbly but she has some friends she knows well round to visit and
she is running about giggling with them,'' she said.
In spite of the custody battle with former boyfriend, Mr Chapman, 35,
Ms Dodds said she would let him see Jasmine any time he wanted.
The couple met when they both worked offshore in 1991 and they shared
a flat in Aberdeen before moving to Mr Chapman's home town of Woodville
in Texas. Shortly afterwards they separated.
Mrs Dempster is flying back to Scotland on Tuesday and she said she
did not know if Jasmine would travel with her. Ms Dodds said she faced
legal bills of $30,000 and is not sure if she will be allowed to leave
America until they are paid.

<HEADLINE>I'm a silly old fool, actor says of his theatrical exit.  Fry puts blame on stage fright</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>4</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>979681533</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
ACTOR Stephen Fry said last night that he had suddenly left his West
End show because of ''stage fright''.
In a faxed statement to his agent Lorraine Hamilton, he explained: ''I
slunk away rather than cause a scene in public.''
Fry seemed convinced he had performed inadequately as KGB agent George
Blake in the new play Cell Mates, but denied poor reviews had caused his
unexpected departure.
''I can only offer cowardice, embarrassment, and distress as excuses
for such absurd behaviour. I'm a silly old fool and I don't deserve this
attention,'' said Fry, 37, who was spotted on a cross-Channel ferry on
Monday.
''I have been horrified and embarrassed to see from the papers how
much attention my departure has provoked.''
The writer and comedy star apologised ''for all the distress and
concern I have caused''.
However, he said he ''desperately needed'' to rethink his life after
realising his work had taken over everything.
''I need a little quietness,'' he said, and asked to be left in peace.
There was still no indication of where the actor had gone.
He last appeared in Cell Mates at the Albery Theatre on Saturday --
his third performance. He narrated a charity performance of Peter And
The Wolf on Sunday, but then disappeared.
However, it was not until Wednesday that the producer announced Fry
would not be returning to the role. Staff at the theatre had believed
his non-appearance in the meantime was due to illness.
''His statement came through on a modem and we don't know what country
it was sent from,'' said a spokeswoman for his agent.
In the statement, Fry said: ''I may live another 37 years and it would
be foolish to carry on doing things for which I haven't either the
aptitude or perhaps the desire.
''After realising how inadequate my performance in Cell Mates was, I'm
afraid I suffered a dreadful attack of what golfers call the yips and
actors call stage fright, and I slunk away rather than cause a scene in
public.
''Basically I couldn't stand the heat so I escaped from the kitchen.
The fact that I did so -- the inadequacy of my acting aside -- perhaps
shows that I am not cut out for the business I have been engaged in for
the past 15 years.''
Fry, widely believed to have quit because of poor reviews, also said
he held ''no grudge'' against theatre critics who slated his
performance.
''I left not out of pique, because I had been wounded or hurt, but
because I was afraid they were terribly right and that I was letting
down Rik Mayall's brilliant performance in Simon Gray's remarkable play.
''They both deserved better and I am delighted and relieved they are
going to get it.''
He added: ''But the reviews and sense of failure were, I think, only
the straw that broke the camel's back. For years now I have been
incapable of saying 'No' and have allowed my work to become my life.''
Fry said he was offering such a full explanation of his precipitate
departure so that people would accept he was not a ''Lord Lucan or a
Reggie Perrin''.
''I hope you will allow me a little space and solitude now, I could
not bear to be 'tracked down' by the media.
''If you can accept my assurances of good health and mental stability,
perhaps you can leave it at that and give up any idea of finding and
confronting me. In time, I will have to return and no doubt face the
music, but for the moment I need a little quietness and if you could
find it in yourselves to allow it to me, I should be very grateful.''
His behaviour was ''not so much a nervous breakdown, more a nervous
stalling,'' he added. Fry also said he would be in touch with his
nearest and dearest to assure them of his good health.
He apologised to his Cell Mates co-star Mayall and playwright Gray for
dealing them ''a very low blow indeed''. He said they had carried the
brunt of the affair.
He praised his understudy Mark Anderson for ''his heroism'' in taking
his place and apologised for the pressure placed on him.
Fry's list of apologies also included one to the producer Duncan
Weldon whom he had treated ''shabbily''.
He wished luck to his replacement Simon Ward saying he would ''do
great justice to a wonderful piece''.

<HEADLINE>Lanark cheese firm awaits listeria ruling</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>4</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>979681534</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE future of a rare Scottish cheese was in the balance last night
after a legal hearing into a council's plan to destroy the maker's
entire stock.
The seized Lanark Blue -- a brand sold at Harrods and other top stores
and bought by the Royal Family -- has unacceptable levels of potentially
hazardous listeria bacteria, says Clydesdale District Council.
After an eight-hour private hearing of legal and technical arguments
in Lanark, JP Mrs Elizabeth Wilson said she would give a written
judgment later.
The threat to the cheese has been linked to moves in the EU and
Britain to clamp down on some kinds of soft cheese in the wake of
repeated scares about food poisoning deaths caused by listeria.
Lanark Blue farmer and cheese plant owner, Humphrey Errington, 50,
says his cheese -- one of the recently-developed varieties which have
helped revive the reputation of Britain's cheesemakers -- is safe to
eat.
He says loss of the 528 kilos of cheese worth #27,000 could spell the
end of Lanark Blue which is made from unpasteurised ewes' milk each
spring and compared by some with French Roquefort.
''The future of our business, and of our employees and their families,
is at stake,'' Mr Errington said before the hearing. ''If we lose this
case, no specialist cheese maker in Britain can feel safe from the
threat of closure.''
Mr Errington, who employs seven cheese workers at Oggscastle, Dunsyre,
Lanarkshire, voluntarily took his cheese off the market in December
after a random test on a sample from an Edinburgh shop revealed
listeria.
But despite Mr Errington's claims that the level of listeria was
normal for soft blue cheese and posed no risk, council environmental
health officers later seized the entire stock.
Last night Mr Errington said: ''I'm satisfied the council produced no
evidence whatsoever to say this cheese was harmful.''

There are 30-odd tomes, and they all belong to Glasgow. But, as
William Hunter discovers, the new three-volume work chronicling the
city's origins and development has a certain added weight
PEOPLE have stayed in Glasgow for l350 years, give or take a century.
Monks settled first. Around them plain folk moved in to supply the
worldly needs of the monastery. What all happened next has taken longer
to tell than live.
With ordinary luck, two more years will have passed before the first
full version has been put in print of the Glasgow story.
Although vats of ink have been spilled on the city, no account of
where it has come from and what it has done comes close to the aims of
Glasgow, a three-volume history. The core of the work centres on
Strathclyde University.
Volume one, published last week, takes the city's tale from its year
dot to l830. Holding for the first time a copy freshly unpacked from the
publishers, Tom Devine, its co-editor and professor of Scottish history
at the university, said: ''I'm staring at it with some disbelief. There
were times when I thought I'd never see it.''
His Glasgow started to be built l0 years ago.
Because the work has been so long on the way, the history book feels
like a part of the personal histories of its contributors and creators.
Its beginnings, like Glasgow's, are blurred. ''I've always thought I
started it,'' mused Gordon Jackson, the volume's other editor and a
reader in economic history at Strathclyde. His interest in the local
histories of British ports -- he has written books about Grimsby and
Hull among others -- was a key embarkation point.
Volume one's extended odyssey seeks to explain how a medieval township
became one of the world's great ports. Its scholarly chapters are not
intended to be plain sailing. Much of the book may be as beyond the
reach of public-library readers as the price of #60.
Tom Devine said: ''We have tried to write it clearly. But it is meant
to be a challenge as well. It is not meant to be a totally accessible
read. We are looking at the experience of one of the world's great
cities -- one that has experienced the whole cycle of movement from
medievalism to early provincial town to eighteenth-century trading city
to major industrial metropolis, and the de-industrialisation and decline
in the twentieth century.''
He reckoned that about 85% of the book was totally new. ''Whether one
agrees or disagrees with the interpretation, the materials used have
never been examined in the same way before,'' he said.
Co-editor Gordon Jackson extended the blurb: ''We weren't looking for
what happened but for the way things happened. It is the difference
between history as everything that happened and history as explaining
change.''
He added: ''Glasgow is the only British port that was a major
industrial city. That's because the city was built on coal and developed
an iron industry and a cotton industry within the port structure.
Liverpool never did. Liverpool was a port and nothing but a port, apart
from small industries.
''There is a commonly held belief, especially on the Continent, that
new cities are not built on the foundations of old cities. That is to
say, the economic advantages of one period do not sustain a city in the
next period. But Glasgow in the eighteenth century (a big part of what's
covered in this volume) is a very peculiar place in that what had been a
run-down ecclesiastical township became a great trading city.
''And on top of a great trading city there came an industrial city. In
that regard Glasgow is not particularly similar to other cities. One of
the reasons is that it was a port. It was an industrial city in the
grand sense and a major port. So, yes, it reinvented itself in a way
that few other cities have done.
''And this, I think, makes a case for Glasgow's being unique.'' Dr
Jackson suggested.
However new and untrodden was the path that the city took in its urban
development, crowds of inky pilgrims have followed its route. Glasgow's
high road and low road are cluttered by chroniclers, among them many
historians. Why another book?
Rough reckoning loads the city's past with about 30 history books. But
they are fewer than they look. Several are the same book. A kindly
epithet for them is rechauffe, a whimsically exotic term for rehash used
by Joe Fisher, for 25 years librarian of the Glasgow Collection of the
Mitchell Library, in his recent The Glasgow Encyclopedia. In a short
elegant essay he lists an odd lot of city recorders -- several of them
merchants, a failed tobacco lord, a priest, a cabinetmaker, even a
vagabond band of journalists.
The earliest chronicler of modern times -- and the ugliest-looking of
any time -- was John McUre, some kind of local official. He touted his
tome in its title: The City of Glasgow; or an account of its origin,
rise, and progress, with a more particular description thereof than has
hitherto been known. Robert Reid's Glasgow, Past and Present ran to
three volumes like the planned Glasgow trilogy. Unlike it, the author
included some gossip picked up from his granny.
Glasgow is being constructed by mixed skills. Geographers, architects,
and town planners write alongside historians. They make a less motley
crew than a bright threesome of a journalist, an artist, and a lawyer
who took an agreeable stroll around the city in l90l under the cloak of
the pen-name, James Hamilton Muir.
Like the good newspaperman he was, James Pagan, a Herald editor,
surfed through the subject in l847. While admitting that he skimmed, he
said he hoped to have been as accurate as time allowed.
Of the lumpy book pile the most excellently written is the pocket-size
Glimpses of Glasgow by Hugh Cochrane, the former Herald writer and
broadcaster who has produced two histories of the city.
The most enduring favourite remains C A Oakley's The Second City, a
companionable read by a guide of all-round learning. As he paraded the
plainstones, Charlie Oakley seemed to carry all his Glasgow lore in his
head and to keep it as readily available as pocket change. Yet he was a
Cornishman.
Being an outsider has sometimes been an advantage, as Tom Devine, a
Motherwell man, and Gordon Jackson, from Lincolnshire, show with their
Glasgow enthusiasm.
Before them, the weightiest offering -- it goes to 3lb -- was the
(l958) Glasgow volume of the Third Statistical Account, most of it
collated by university writers. About its l008 pages Joe Fisher in his
encyclopedia gives a measured verdict -- ''a bird's-eye view'', he calls
it. Unsatisfied, he asks for more. ''The city still awaits an authentic,
accurate, and well-documented history,'' he insists.
Glasgow will have the avoirdupois. Its weightiness will be double the
Statistical Account's. Its three volumes will be a six-pounder
manoeuvred by seven editors. For the first part alone the writing has
been by ll pairs of hands chosen from six universities. Much of the work
had to be done in snatched weekend leisure time. Given the tenderness of
academic egos and the jealousies among universities, it sounds an
explosive mixture. There are the makings of melodrama behind the scenes.
Inquiries about whether volume one's serene-looking pages of cool
learning were created by any hidden volcanic eruptions or other personal
fall-outs are met with civilised fibbing.
''Everything was perfect,'' Gordon Jackson wanted to insist. ''We put
a few full stops and commas in later on,'' he conceded. Irene Maver, the
lecturer in Scottish history at Glasgow University who wrote the chapter
on civic authority (and is joint editor of volume two), protested: ''I
am quite deferential and sheepish. I do what I'm told. Both editors were
quite indulgent. I didn't find them difficult.''
Tom Markus, the Hungarian-born former professor of architecture at
Strathclyde, shares one chapter with two other contributors. He recalled
that their file of material accumulated on his floor to a height of 1ft.
He revealed: ''It wasn't quite as laissez-faire as has been suggested.
''If things got out of step in terms of a lack of analytical approach
and too much florid lauguage, then the editors certainly said so. Chunks
of a very early draft were commented on in a very severe and healthy
way. I have found one manuscript they had a go at. There is much more of
their writing on it than ours,'' he divulged.
Professor Markus's recollections warmed Gordon Jackson to some of his
own. He remembered that one chapter ran to more than twice the length of
words he had asked for. In a rush of candour he also owned up: ''I did a
hatchet job on some of the work. There comes a stage when you don't
mince words. Some of my comments were very lengthy because that is my
way,'' he admitted, while describing some other of his notes as ''brutal
and Stalinist stuff''.
''But only at the end did we come in and wave the stick from time to
time . . .''
''Wouldn't you be better to use the word 'lash'?'' Tom Devine
interposed.
If having ll writers labouring together between the same covers
suggests co-operation by committee, the secret of success was that the
committee never met. Teamwork by the Glasgow XI was innate. ''One of the
advantages was that most of the chapters were written by people at
Strathclyde University or who had been trained at Strathclyde.
Immediately, there was a kind of ethos. We all knew each other as
friends,'' Tom Devine said. ''We chose the chapters and then the
faces.''
When they had decided the shape the volume would take, the editors
populated it with writers they knew. ''We found that by letting
academics we trusted have their head we ended up with what we wanted,''
Gordon Jackson agreed.
Glasgow's smiles, however, ended at the university's walls.
Extramurally, there has been no help. Although the book had a civic
reception for its launch, that was been the size of municipal
hospitality. There has been no business sponsorship. Never mind any
funding, there have not even been bus fares. All production costs,
except a university grant for one research assistant for one year, are
being carried by Manchester University Press.
Editorial director Richard Purslow reckons the press's investment at
around #25,000. About half of book sales will be overseas. For far-flung
readers a glossary explains strange Scotch terms like bailie, burgh,
provost, and wappenshaw (an exhibition of arms). ''I want to see this
volume read by people who are interested in the development of large
towns and cities whether they be in Auckland, Chicago, or Paris,'' Tom
Devine declared.
Although the university press of Manchester comes third in size in
Britain, it is an internal irony of Glasgow that it has gone outside the
city for its publisher. For occupying a majestic amount of space in its
first-volume pages are the Foulis brothers, Glasgow printers to the old
university.
Robert Foulis, who had started out to be a barber, liked to boast that
he supplied scholarly books of philosophy, religion, and especially
immaculate Greek and Latin texts to most of Europe. He founded the
city's first newspaper. To have Glasgow now coming out of Manchester
will disturb some old graves. Closer to home are other hauntings.
In l9l7 when Glasgow councillors commissioned a whole history of the
city they first gave the job to Robert Renwick, a depute town clerk.
When the pen fell from his hand, George Eyre-Todd, a journalist and man
of letters, picked it up. But at his death the adventure was abandoned
when the narrative had reached only l832, by then a century short of
being up to date.
Although Glasgow has reached the l830s in a oner, it still has rather
further to go. Confidence is not helped by remembering that a vast
academic history of agrarian England once took so long to complete that
mortality accounted one after the other for three of its editors.
Tom Devine darkened and hollowed his voice to Vincent Price
spookiness. ''This is the spectre that has hung over the Glasgow
history,'' he intoned.

Ninian Dunnett concludes his series with a look at the work of the
pilots who bring vessels clean up the Clyde
THERE'S something a little magical about the idea of a ship at sea,
perhaps on a blowy winter night, being boarded by a lone pilot who
climbs the ladder on its side and guides the vessel safely to port.
There have been guides round our coasts -- perhaps originally local
fishermen or ferrymen -- as long as there have been boats, and until
very recently the experienced sea captains who make up the Scottish
pilotage remained self-employed, working in co-operative groups.
Now, like the 12 pilots who handle the 450 square miles of the Clyde,
its estuary, and neighbouring sea lochs, they are mainly employed by our
port authorities. With containerisation fostering a huge increase in the
amount of goods leaving Scotland by lorry, and the EC encouraging
traffic away from the Atlantic ports, the estuary is much quieter than
in its heyday. But working from home, on call 24 hours a day, one week
on, one week off, the Clyde pilots are still responsible for guiding
some 2000 vessels a year, from supertankers going to Finnart to general
cargo boats into Glasgow.
From Plockton, 47-year-old Douglas Mackenzie piloted in the Middle
East and Papua New Guinea before returning to Scotland.
D M: ''You certainly see a lot of white knuckles in this business --
sometimes mine. You're dealing with big lumps of metal and human
elements, and it can create its own adrenalin. Once you take a ship up
the river it's all very narrow, combine that with a strong tide and
cross-winds, and you've got to be on the ball.
''And whether it's wet and three o'clock in the morning or a nice
Sunday afternoon, you've basically got to put people at their ease.
You've effectively taken the vessel out of the Master's hands for a
limited period, so there's got to be a fair rapport. But that's a nice
part of the job, most of the time. I enjoy it.''
From Greenock, Donald Campbell is 60.
D C: ''My father was a chief engineer and my grandfather, and I went
to sea with the Donaldson Line at 18, in the Atlantic and South America,
and running emigrants to New Zealand. At 27 I got my Master's
certificate. Then I was in a wee ship running to Nova Scotia in the
wintertime, 18 days to get there, and it wasn't very nice; the chief
engineer used to sleep in his bath. So in 1965 I put my name in for the
pilotage.
''You do four years' training, starting out on small ships and
gradually working your way up to supertankers. That's completely
different from everything else; we've had 350,000 tonnes in at Finnart,
and you have to think very far ahead -- they take three miles to stop.
''But there were 56 pilots here when I started; there's much less
traffic now. And we're working with rubbish; the standard of ships and
crews has fallen dramatically. The owners just want the cheapest. And if
you've got a crew from the Maldives who're huddled about freezing,
they're not going to leap into action and do things. The Germans are
employing Poles now, and the Master can't speak Polish, and the crew
can't speak German.''
From Glasgow, Alistair Miller, 59, joined the pilotage in 1967.
A M: ''You keep it all in your head -- the physical limits of the
estuary, the Gantock Rocks that you have to avoid, and shallow patches
at Skelmorlie Bank; you seldom need to consult charts. And you're always
conscious of the weather and other traffic. The estuary is vastly used
by commercial traffic and naval vessels; and by yachts in the summer,
and you have to be aware of them, particularly if they are racing.
''Transferring to a ship from a pilot cutter is quite hazardous too.
We have had three pilots in the water in my career here, fortunately
without fatal results, and usually due to some malfunction with the
pilot ladder. On a winter's night and in the dark with a long way to
climb, you do have to rely on the fellows at the other end -- you can't
go up and check it.
''Our average age here is very high, unfortunately. When Donald and I
started, you didn't get in until you were 30, and if you weren't in by
35, you didn't get in. The retirees weren't replaced over the years, and
it's probably kept a living going for the fewer and fewer that remain;
but in a very few years all the pilots could be gone -- so I think
they're going to have to give serious consideration to recruiting.
''But working from home is fine. We've all got hobbies and I don't
think time hangs heavy on our hands. Though the wives would maybe
disagree -- we're under their feet all the time.
''I am optimistic about the Clyde. We're bringing in a lot of coal in
large shipments from Colombia just now, and there are hopeful signs that
we've bottomed out. The river's definitely getting busier.

Dancing to a different tune has brought a new maturity to the
Oscar-nominated actor. But the man who has paid his dues
is still wary about the confetti of compliments that followed
his 'rebirth', as Douglas Thompson discovers
This has been a revival
for me, but until the next
one comes along I am not
going over the moon
HE LOOKS like a man without a worry, but there is torment in the
once-again new John Travolta. When you have been reprocessed more than
corned beef, the confetti of compliments melt quickly. Even an Oscar
nomination is difficult to digest. Travolta, understandably, does it in
a gee-whiz sort of way. He's a gee-whiz guy. Always has been, always
will be.
The difference is that maturity has made him much more careful with
the gushing. It would be pleasant if he won the Best Actor Oscar on
March 27. This is a man who has paid his dues.
Travolta established himself in America in the funky situation comedy
Welcome Back, Kotter, and then in the world in Grease and Saturday Night
Fever. At 41, he is enjoying a professional rebirth with Pulp Fiction,
this year's love-it-or-loathe-it-movie. But he's wary about it.
At first, Travolta hides it well. He says he's a stone lighter than
the stocky, smack-addicted punk hit man -- a great and generous
performance that won him his Best Actor Oscar nomination last week --
who gyrates with Uma Thurman in what is becoming the serious Academy
Awards competition to Tom Hanks and Forrest Gump.
Pulp Fiction is the film that brings Travolta back as an actor, as
opposed to the Look Who's Talking movies which simply reincarnated the
celebrity. He knows it all too well. The hair is thinning at the front,
there's a Prince Charles patch expanding towards the back of the neck,
there are a couple of chins that weren't previously in his phone book,
but Travolta is still a man who wants to twist and shout.
He delivers a career performance in Pulp Fiction and is now the urban
bad boy. Travolta, the long-haired hit man, and Thurman, his evil
employer's statuesque and cocaine-addicted wife, twist to the Chuck
Berry song You Never Can Tell, and it's one of the movie's big moments.
And, of course, you never can. Travolta has always been a worker, but
a couple of years ago he thought his career was over. ''There were hints
about this film or that film, but there were never any serious offers. I
have strong beliefs, but even they could not help me from feeling things
were finished. This has been a revival for me, but until the next one
comes along I am not going over the moon about it.''
But he should be. We are talking in the vast lounge of a Beverly Hills
hotel, and there's a football squad of folks around just to ''mind''
this reborn boy. His caution is understandable. But he is not miserable
or untrusting. He simply knows the difference between Oscars and
raspberries.
Whatever happens at the Academy Awards next month -- and he has strong
competition from not just Hanks, but nostalgia favourite Paul Newman, at
70, and Britain's outsider Nigel Hawthorne -- he is going with his luck.
At present he is filming Get Shorty, an adaptation of best-selling
novelist Elmore Leonard's hilarious tale of a Florida hoodlum who chases
a bad bet in Hollywood and suddenly believes Tinseltown might deliver
more.
And Travolta remains the first choice of James Cagney and his estate
to portray the legendary star in a film biography. Cagney met Travolta
after seeing him dance in Grease and Saturday Night Fever and offered:
''You're my man.'' Today, the now-always cautious Travolta says: ''It
was one of the great compliments of my life, and it is a project I
intend to complete.''
He sits nervously, this man who it would appear has the world at his
feet. He's rather awkward talking about the revival. Money has never
been a problem. He and his wife, the actress Kelly Preston, have homes
in California and Florida, private jets, private school for their
three-year-old son, Jett, and a lavish lifestyle that would have run and
run on Travolta's past achievements.
Pulp Fiction has disrupted his ''retirement''. He lets loose that shy
smile: ''I thought I had had my 20 years, and I was pleased with it.
And, to be honest, I was happy to go with it until this something
special happened.
''There were always carrots, little things to keep me in the business,
but it seemed my style was never going to be in fashion again. This
movie has brought me back, but I don't want to be overwhelmed by it or
by the attraction it has given me.
''I'm still a strong member of the Scientology church, and that helps
me keep things in perspective. We're all human, and sometimes the
compliments do get me carried away. But I've been here before and I
think I can handle it this time. It's a tremendous honour to be
nominated for an Academy Award and, yes, it's going to be quite a
night.''
Other Scientology members such as Tom Cruise and Priscilla Presley
will be there to cheer him on. Travolta joined the church in 1975 and
says his belief helped him deal with his fall from stardom. Of course,
Pulp Fiction may be macabre comedy, but there are gallons of director /
writer Quentin Tarantino's trademark bloodletting. How did Travolta
resolve his beliefs with such gleeful sadism?
''I worried about it for several weeks, then thought through the
concept and accepted it. I am the least violent person in the world --
well, I think I am -- but I saw it more as a cartoon than anything that
could be regarded as reality. It gave me a strong part to play.
''It was enormous fun to do a film like this, because it was an
ensemble piece and I was able to concentrate on my particular role. It's
been a long time since I've worked on a film that had so many scenes. My
life seems to have been on a roller-coaster, but I've been very lucky
playing Vincent Vega.''
Until now, Travolta had been stuck in the memory as the
flare-trousered piece of kitsch dancing along to the Bee Gees. But there
were other moments, such as director Brian De Palma's Blow Out, but they
were just that -- moments. The Look Who's Talking films made money for
him, but not a movie star reputation.
Tarantino -- an admitted couch potato and fan of Kotter -- says
Travolta always attracted him as a performer and he saw him as Vincent,
the sleek-haired somewhat goofy hit man. ''John brought a whole life to
the movie. I didn't need a young punk -- I needed someone who would
understand the depths of what was required. He provided that with no
problem.''
Travolta saw it as a challenge: ''I was given the opportunity to take
a character and work with it as best I could. That was the challenge
offered to me and I happily accepted it. It's always difficult to deal
with fame.
''One moment you are the flavour that everyone wants, then you become
yesterday's boy. I'm not bitter about what happened to me, only grateful
that I have been given another chance. I think this makes a new life for
me. I'm being regarded now as a grown-up.
''For years many people perceived me as simply this guy who danced
around in movies from a long time ago. What's happening for me is a
change in attitude. A couple of years ago I felt as low as I've ever
done. I really thought that things were never going to happen for me
again. But that's changed.
''Things change. Life changes -- and that's what we've all got to
believe.''

LOVE them or hate them, there would appear to be simply no escape from
mobile phones.
Walk along most city streets and you will inevitably find some poor
blighter hunched up in a doorway, shouting furiously into some silly
little piece of plastic dangling from a lughole.
Far from being discouraged, many car companies are now actively
pushing this trade. Citroen are the latest to fling in a free mobile
phone with any new car or van bought.
Even better, the French car giant is actually making its offer more
attractive by allowing the phone to be passed on to a friend, family
member, or colleague. Now doesn't that sound like a good idea?
Any Citroen bought before the end of March automatically qualifies for
the deal.
SWITCHED-on motorists can be both snug and smug when the next cold
snap strikes.
Frosted windscreens, frozen fingers, and frayed wiper blades can be
avoided if a motorist chooses a car with a heated front windscreen.
Many of the major companies, such as Ford and Jaguar, now offer the
heated facility on many models. At the touch of a button, the windscreen
can be defrosted within a couple of minutes by tungsten wires finer than
a human hair.
Makers Triplex Safety Glass, whose heated rearscreens became the norm
in the 1960s and 1970s, believe the same could happen with hotscreen in
the next few years.
TAKE A SEAT. It would appear that this is one offer many British
motorists are, indeed, finding hard to resist.
The Spanish firm reported sales were up 50% last year. Hopes are high
that the newest SEAT model, the Cordoba, will boost business even
further.
Cutting no corners in interior space, performance or refinement, the
1.6-litre four-door compact features a surprisingly large loadbay and
headroom space in its class.
All models are also equipped with state-of-the-art safety features
that include side-impact resisting door bars, collapsible steering
column, and front seat-belt grabbers.
Standard equipment on the CLX model includes power steering, glass
tilt or slide sunroof, tinted glass, six-speaker digital radio casette,
rear spoiler, and rev counter.
UNLESS you are switched on and fully tuned in, buying a new, or indeed
used, car can be an absolute nightmare.
Walk into any car showroom and the sales staff automatically treat you
like a long-lost brother, or sister, and before you know it . . . you've
bought the ''donkey'' they've been desperately trying to flog for
months.
Now, however, the Automobile Association is introducing a new service
that it hopes will take the lottery out of buying a new set of wheels.
Buyers can get written reports on nearly 200 models via the AA's Autofax
facility.
It provides instant access to AA engineers' appraisals of new and used
vehicles. With Autofax, car buyers dial 0336 424999 on their fax
machine, and in return receive a list of cars for which individual
reports are available.
Calls to the service are charged at 39p per minute cheap rate, and 49p
at all other times.

Adam and Even are to blame for the little devil in us all. Less
fun-loving forces are responsible for trying to contain it. In the face
of the 40 days of fasting and abstinence that are almost upon us, John
Linklater offers some tempting Lenten thoughts on the harsh and
humourless realities of virtue in all its many pretences
FAITH is handy if you need to move a mountain. The Bible actually says
remove, which proves it wasn't just finding the best place for the
living-room suite that people could never agree. Getting the mountains
rolling was OK, but which faith was the best one for the job?
The mountain removals in Scotland were a substantial operation with a
lot of giant skips and big furniture vans heading north for the
Highlands. You can imagine the sheer power of faith that was
concentrated on the task. In the end, though, no single faith got the
removal contract. Faith was split.
Complicating things further, not everyone agreed with the policy of
making the Central Belt flat. Chief among sceptics was Kenneth McKellar
who protested These Are My Mountains, not merely one of the worst songs
in history, but a conservation anthem and one of the principal reasons
the Reformation cracked down on singing. You had to have faith. You just
weren't to make a song and dance about it. Leave the mountains alone and
keep the faith. That was about it.
Which is what makes faith so deadly, it is inflexible. It doesn't
encourage questions, just obedience. The more irrational its basis, the
stronger it seems to bind the faithful, and the less tolerant they get.
What is more puzzling is that in Scotland most people define their faith
by the church they no longer attend. The Kingdom of God has devolved
assemblies all over the place. It has also been more given to civil war
than any other in history.
People are proud to say that their faith is blind. Blind faith is
supposed to be the ultimate loyalty, but only an insecure God or an Earl
Haig would be flattered to receive it. Both were rotten generals.
Men never do evil so fully and so happily as when they do it as an act
of faith, said Pascal. The Inquisition had a term for it: auto da fe. It
was a clever concept. The faith was not permitted to shed blood. So they
simply burned heretics instead.
HOPE springs eternal, until it is fading. Usually in the plural.
Usually in the past tense. As in ''Hopes were fading last night . . .''
Which is probably why Francis Bacon said ''Hope is a good breakfast, but
it is a bad supper'', and with a name like that he was an authority.
When hope triumphs over experience it bodes ill. Dr Johnson coined
that phrase of a man remarrying after an unhappy first. Each latest
Great White Hope always gets thumped. Hopes get dashed. They prove
false. They vanish. They are always around the corner, but never here.
They get deferred. Or they admit the ultimate in hopelessness: hoping
for the best.
Abandon all hope, ye who enter. You don't have to reach Dante's hell
to read that sign above the doorways leading to quiet desperation. Most
people have to handle despair. It's hope that does them in. He that
lives on hope will die fasting, said Benjamin Franklin.
Products of sheer desperation, there is nothing that fear or hope will
not make a person believe. Hear someone say, ''I hope'' and understand
that they are saying ''I fear''. The basis of optimism, as Oscar Wilde
knew, is sheer terror. Or great cynicism. Some hope.
The deadliness of the whole process is illustrated in hope. The
classical virtues are just a series of antonyms of the normal human
condition. Where we suffer doubt we are told it is better to have faith.
When the outlook is grim we are taught it is good to have hope. If
weakness is the norm, we must have fortitude. The virtues combine as an
elaborate system of tantalising ennoblements, covertly designed to
disparage and taunt humankind. The practice of virtue does not alter the
predicament, it just prolongs the torment.
Hope asks something for nothing, and rarely gets it. The Oxford
English Dictionary defines hope as expectation without implication of
desire, which is as good as saying expectation without any danger of
fulfilment. Hope is the least difficult of the virtues, the one we are
instinctively programmed to perform. That alone should alert suspicion.
CHARITY begins at home, if you've got one. Being homeless, presumably,
is held to be a vice. Not only can you not begin to practise charity,
you can't receive it, being debarred from this home where it begins.
Where does it end? The poorhouse. And a house is not a home. That more
or less defines the Catch 22 position of the virtues on poverty.
The virtue of charity, it must be concluded, is not to benefit the
recipient, but to edify the giver. The privileged get to feel even
better about themselves. It is an award for having plenty. Or it could
be a way of making a wee apology for being rich, with the bonus
incentive of becoming virtuous. More people have been flattered into
virtue than bullied out of vice, according to Surtees. It was charity,
remember, that covered a multitude of sins.
Margaret Thatcher, that charitable patron, once pointed out that
nobody would still remember the good Samaritan if he had only been able
to offer good intentions. He needed to have money as well.
Had God had been more charitable then earth would be heaven, and
Basingstoke would be promoted to hell. There is a basic contradiction
here, and the Maker didn't exactly practise what is preached in his
name. But hyprocrisy is said to be the homage that vice offers to
virtue. Let's be charitable, and say that God moved in mysterious ways
when he created an imperfect world, and then issued codes for humanity's
self-improvement.
St Paul, who added the Christian virtues of faith, hope, and charity
to the four of prudence, temperance, fortitude, and justice that had
been good enough for Socrates, Plato and Aristotle, rated it: ''the
greatest of these is charity''. We have a problem with the translation.
He meant love. Every new revised version of the Bible says love. But the
censor got in on the King James version and cleaned it up as charity,
just in case any of the sinners came away with the idea that they could
get their leg over to become virtuous.
PRUDENCE is a rotten name for a girl. Faith is alright. Hope is okay.
Even Charity is, well not exactly sweet, but interesting in a suggestive
way. What is she giving away? Prudence, on the other hand, is thoroughly
unflattering, half prude, half dense. It is a name hidden by thrifty old
board members called Miss Simpkins and acned convent-school prefects who
hoard all their Easter eggs in separate baskets. ''A rich, ugly old maid
courted by Incapacity,'' said Blake.
I once knew a man who had a crush on a woman called Prudence, but he
admitted that she wrote for the Church (of England) Times. Such is the
destiny of healthy babes named after tedious virtues.
Prudence is the most mean-spirited of the seven. It is the don't to
end all don'ts, the never to end all nevers, the not to end all nots.
''Tell not all you know, believe not all you hear, do not all you are
able,'' is an Italian proverb, as if Italians had the slightest
inclination towards prudence. We Scots are less fortunate. To be a
victim of prudence is our blighted birthright, though it is called
moderation. In all things. Stevenson knew it only too well: ''So soon as
prudence has begun to grow up in the brain, like a dismal fungus, it
finds its first expression in a paralysis of generous acts.''
It is a classic case of making a virtue out of mediocrity. ''He that
leaveth nothing to chance will do few things ill,'' said Halifax. ''But
he will do very few things.''
If most of the virtues are about preaching conformities, prudence is
the most blatant in actively seeking to stifle ambition in the able, the
talented, and the trouble-maker. Prudence cautions against initiative
and risk. It rewards low profiles and safe pairs of hands with the
consolation of virtuousness.
Prudence is the perfect haven for those without the courage, rather
than the inclination, to indulge in vice. ''The unfulfilled desires of
the virtuous are evil,'' said Edwin Muir, with devastating imprudence.
TEMPERANCE is a dirty trick. It asks more than a single virtue should
have any right. The contentedly bibulous have to hit the wagon. The
wanton, the lustful, the sexually voracious, the libidinous, and the
lubricious must adopt chastity or fidelity. Gluttons must curb their
appetite. As a rate of exchange for some of the best vices going,
temperance is daylight robbery.
Any virtue that founded its own international society betrays a
suspicious zeal. The Temperance Movement reached Scotland in the 1830s
from the United States, promoting abstinence and threatening a domestic
economy which owed much to the contribution of the whisky industry.
Temperance is not just a killjoy virtue, it threatens Scottish identity.
The American experience with Prohibition ought to serve as a lasting
warning of the dangers of enacting a constitutional amendment to appease
a cardinal virtue. Its repeal in 1933 is one of this century's great
victories over malicious sanctimony. This episode is a classic
illustration of Samuel Butler's dictum: ''If virtue had everything her
own way she would be as insufferable as dominant factions generally
are.''
The promotion of temperance is deadly exploitation of the psychology
of virtue. If a person enjoys doing something they will be vulnerable to
the suggestion that it must be wrong. Fun is the most susceptible of
human reliefs to guilt. The suspicion has to be that temperance is the
pet virtue of the joyless. That wise old bird La Rochefoucauld had a
maxim for this 300 years ago: ''Sobriety is love of health, or inability
to eat much.''
If it is bad to be without virtues, it's worse to be without
temptation. Walpole said that virtue knew to a farthing what it had lost
by not having been a vice. Temperance asks too great a sacrifice for too
little a reward, and it must have been the invention of some grim sect
who simply did not have the stomach or appetite for pleasure. Once you
turn incapacity into a virtue you can reward yourself with a spurious
moral superiority. Abstinence makes the heart grow harder.
JUSTICE is mine, saith a better Lord than the one we got. The Bible
only talks about vengeance, retribution, and The Last Judgment. Eternal
damnation is God's idea of a parking fine, so what chance of mercy? We
are genetically programmed to sin. We fell from grace before we were
even born. We can't escape the rap.
This isn't fair. Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, nuke for
nuke. What kind of an idea of justice is that to promote? Heap coals of
fire upon his head, says the Bible in one of its more generous asides.
No wonder that the greatest acts of barbarism in human history have been
carried out in God's name. ''Your justice would freeze beer,'' John
Proctor says in The Crucible. ''The justice of our cause'' is one of the
deadliest constructions in any language, and it guarantees copious
shedding of blood.
Justice is the idea that humanity can sort out the mess left by
creation. We should have been better equipped for the job, like Superman
''fighting a never ending battle for truth, justice and the American
way''. The Artful Dodger's remark, in Oliver Twist, is slightly more
realistic: ''This ain't no shop for justice.''
If it is such an indisputable virtue, why does justice invariably have
to be enforced? Even faith, hope, and charity are not forced upon us,
merely recommended. It is only justice that feels compelled to use the
symbol of the sword, and a set of scales to weigh whatever has been
lopped off the accused, presumably. This hardly encourages the idea that
justice is negotiable, or even reasonable, let alone fair.
A sense of injustice is a far more constructive virtue. It has an
honourable tradition in humanist philosophy and practice, challenging
what is wrong and unacceptable. Injustice anywhere is a threat to
justice everywhere, as Martin Luther King said. It remains anywhere.
The trouble with a sense of justice its readiness to punish, to impose
order, and it proceeds with more love for itself than the humanity it is
supposed to serve.
FORTITUDE is precisely what we need to withstand the assault of the
Seven Deadly Virtues. Endurance, patience, forbearance, hardiness,
perseverance, and resolution are the attributes you would preach if you
were a doctor prescribing vile medicine, or a government minister
justifying crippling economies. If the other virtues had worked there
would be no need for fortitude.
The agenda must be flawed. The diagnosis creates as much hardship as
it pretends to remedy. The pill is too bitter to swallow, and we are
entitled to suspect that it is a mere palliative. The virtues fail to
get to the heart of the human condition, they just ask us to grin and
bear it. The seven are a set of anodynes, moral sedatives. They don't
cure anything but they are supposed to make you more pleased with
yourself.
''Adversity doth best discover virtue,'' said Francis Bacon, but it
might just as well have been the other way around. The virtues assume
the constant presence of adversity, but fortitude cautions you not to do
anything rash to change it. Van Gogh remarked that desolation,
loneliness, poverty, and misery, all ends and all extremes, made him
think of God. Was that fortitude, or bitter resignation? It manifests
itself much the same way.
Even the platitudes about virtue make very modest claims. Virtue is
its own reward. With fortitude it is difficult to see what benefits
derive, apart from an ability to put up with yourself struggling to be
virtuous. Make a virtue of necessity? There would seem to be little
choice.
The Seven Virtues are presented to us as models of moral excellence.
Without vice they would have very little point, so perhaps it is our
duty to give the virtuous something really sinful to react against. It
would help them to stand out and be counted.
Otherwise the prejudice in favour of virtue is inexplicable. Who can
imagine that a virtuous maid is more interesting than a woman of easy
virtues? And it's not the seven deadly virtues that make a man a good
husband, according to Somerset Maugham, but the 300 pleasing
amiabilities.

White-knuckle time
for Bill Caven as
he goes behind the
wheel of an Audi
flying machine
IT was only after the third cup of extremely strong black coffee that
the colour started to appear, slowly, back on my face. Before then, we
were talking a shade whiter than Michael Jackson!
Granted, I had been well warned in advance that the Audi Avant RS2
wasn't your average souped-up estate car with a smart set of alloys
thrown on simply to give it a sporty image. For once, a car salesman
actually told the truth. However, nothing, but nothing, quite prepares
you for the white-knuckle performance that this monster delivers.
Unreal, awesome and, yes, frightening.
The RS2 actually boasts a 0-30mph time superior to the McLaren F1,
reaching this in a mere one-and-a-half seconds. Keep the foot on the
pedal and it will blast its way from a standing start to 60mph in 4.8
seconds. This is no flash in the pan either, as the Audi's mid-range
performance is equally outrageous, the 30-70mph dash being achieved in
under five seconds. To secure its tag as the world's quickest and
fastest estate, it only gives up when it reaches 163mph.
The car is, in fact, a shining example of German auto-making at its
best. Some jiggery-pokery between Audi and Porsche has resulted in this
particular babe. The five cylinder turbocharged multivalve engine in the
Avant was re-engineered by Porsche from 230 bhp, as in the standard Audi
80 estate, to 315 bhp.
The distinctive body styling of the RS2 also has a number of key
Porsche elements, including high performance 988 Club Sport brakes,
bumpers, 17-inch alloy wheels, wing mirrors, and certain interior
features.
Equipment missing from this car, however, which I believe should be
standard, are a parachute and a pair of brown cords!
Once you get over the initial shock of just how ferocious the
performance capabilities of this flying machine are, the car simply
handles like the rest of the Audi range: extremely impressively. The
ride is firm, assisted no end by the well-proven Quattro four-wheel
drive system and the chunky Dunlop sports tyres. Both of these ensure a
high-degree of driver confidence, especially when attempting to corner
at high speed.
While the six-speed gearbox is definitely not as slick as the one on
Audi's 2-litre coupe, which I drove several weeks ago, there is, in
fairness, little need to use the gears as with many cars.
In keeping with German traditions, the interior of the Audi is well
put together, offering a high degree of comfort and practicality. The
leather seats are nicely padded to allow the driver and passengers to
sink in as the estate hurtles along.
Standard specification is impressive, although, frankly, it should be,
as the price tag for this beast is around #46,000. A small price to pay,
nevertheless, if you are planning a bank raid and want a reliable
getaway car. A feature on the car is a perimeter alarm and three-way
immobiliser, a wise move, perhaps, because if this thing gets nicked in
Glasgow the chances are it will easily be in London several hours later.
Only 180 RS2 models are being imported to the UK market by Audi and,
like the car, they are moving fast.

A CROSS-COUNTRY skier was rescued last night after falling 150ft down
a gully on a mountain in the West Highlands.
Teacher Clive Morrell, 28, of London, fell through a snow cornice --
an over-hanging slab of packed, wind-driven snow -- on 3437ft Beinn a
Chaorainn, overlooking Glen Spean, four miles north-east of Tulloch,
near Fort William.
Police said he was skiing with a companion in poor visibility when the
accident happened. The other skier went for help, and Lochaber Mountain
Rescue Team and an RAF Sea King search and rescue helicopter from
Lossiemouth were alerted.
However, Mr Morrell was walking off the mountain when the rescuers
arrived. He was taken to Belford Hospital, Fort William, but was not
believed to be badly injured.
Avalanche warnings were posted last night in many part of the
Highlands.
In Glencoe, about 50 rescuers with sniffer-dogs spent yesterday
digging for three climbers from Yorkshire, feared buried by an
avalanche. The search for the men, missing since Wednesday, was stood
down last night as darkness fell. Police said it would probably be
resumed today.
The missing men are Mr Allan Lang, 50, a research engineer, and his
son, Richard, 18, both of Dewsbury, and Mr Paul Bower, 18, of Wakefield.
They were reported overdue on Wednesday on a climb near Coire na
Tulaich on Buachaille Etive Mor at the south end of Glencoe.
An RAF spokesman said that mountain rescue teams from RAF Kinloss and
RAF Leuchars, with the Glencoe team, concentrated on a stretch of
avalanche debris 200 yards long, 50 yards wide, and 30ft deep.
They dug trenches and searched with long avalanche probes but no trace
of the missing climbers was found.

In a world far removed from the dreaming spires of neighbouring
Oxford where he worked, a young Scots biochemist was gunned
down in a strange incident that still baffles police. Reporter
James McKillop and photographer Jeff Mitchell investigate
THOSE who knew him best were astounded to learn that their friend
Spike Meenaghan was last seen alive working with a plane at the front
door of his terraced house on the outskirts of Oxford. ''I would not
have thought that he even knew what a plane was for. He was hardly a DIY
enthusiast. You could see that just by looking at his bedroom windows.
Spike was too lazy to put up curtain rails, so he covered the windows
with blankets.''
It was a Saturday afternoon shortly before Christmas, and darkness was
falling rapidly. Not many people were about in the Blackbird Leys estate
at Cowley. Oxford United were playing Cardiff at home, and those not
attending the match were in town completing their Christmas shopping or
just staying indoors.
Having finished the job on the front door, Spike reverted to
character. He went inside and switched on his television set to catch
the Celtic result; he turned up the volume. Spike was an avid supporter
of the famous Glasgow club, and had suffered with them during their many
downs of recent seasons. However, although it was by now almost totally
dark outside, he did not turn on the lights.
What happened next left friends and colleagues numbed with shock. Even
now, more than two months later, they remain dumbfounded. ''It is
totally inexplicable. Spike was a larger-than-life person, both in
appearance and in personality. He got on with everybody with whom he
came in contact. Even though he was 6ft 3ins tall and extremely fit, he
would run away from a fight rather than get involved. He was just one
heck of a nice guy.''
By now it was 4.25pm. Spike was settling in front of the television in
the lounge when something made him go into the adjacent kitchen. He was
not, as has been suggested, going to make a cup of tea. It is possible
he had heard a noise at the rear of his house and went to investigate.
Nobody knows, except, perhaps, his killer.
As Spike entered the kitchen, a single shot was fired through the
kitchen window from outside the house. From the spread of the shotgun
pellets, the victim was between six and 12 feet away from his killer.
Fatally wounded, Spike struggled to the kitchen phone and dialled 999.
He tried to speak into the mouthpiece, but was unable to come out with
anything intelligible. However, the operator traced the call, and police
and ambulance were at the scene in minutes.
The officers had to force their way into the house. But they were too
late. Spike was lying dead on the kitchen floor. Mercifully, he could
not have been in distress for long. The killer had made good his or her
escape.
The manner of the death of this 33-year-old post-doctoral research
worker in Oxford University's Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, who
chose to live in the working-class Blackbird Leys estate, has caused
widespread speculation. But many of the rumours have been wide of the
mark.
The housing estate in which biochemist Dr Michael Meenaghan chose to
live was made notorious in the early 1990s when young boys nightly put
on ''hotting'' shows for 200-strong groups of spectators and the
television cameras by burning rubber with their skilful handbrake turns
and skids in stolen cars. It was a world away from the dreaming spires,
quadrangles, lawns, and punting, of Spike's work environment.
Among those who have been following reports of the town-and-gown
murder in the local paper has been Colin Dexter, creator of Detective
Chief Inspector Morse. ''This is an obvious case for Morse,'' he told
me. ''Who knows, it might well be at some time in the future.''
Born in Stirling Royal Infirmary on December 4, 1961, Mike Meenaghan
grew up in Bannockburn. He attended the local St Mary's primary school
and later St Modan's High in Stirling.
It was at school that he first developed a taste for stadium rock, an
obsession that was to remain for the rest of his life. Every so often he
would get involved in playground squabbles as he insisted that Emerson,
Lake and Palmer was by far a much better band than Yes. By this time he
was also a devoted Celtic supporter.
His parents were more than proud when he won a place at Stirling
University, where he studied biochemistry. It was there that he
developed his sporting skills. Spike played cricket, but was also
introduced to volleyball. The sport is big everywhere in the world,
except in Scotland. Such was his enthusiasm and skill that he was soon
playing first division in the national league.
It had been a young relative who somehow could never get a tongue
around the name Mike that was to lead to his nickname Spike. It could
not have been more appropriate.
In volleyball, when a player hits an unreturnable ball down into the
opponents' half, it is called spiking. ''There was no greater spiker
that I came across,'' said Rod Ireland, who many years later was to
become his coach and certainly one of his best friends. ''It was not
that he would just smack it down hard. He could see the hole in the
opposition defence and went for that space. He used his intelligence.''
And intelligent he was. Spike was to graduate with a BSc Hons and then
gained his MSc. He was also to get married in June, 1982. He and his
wife, Anne, had a son named Michael after his father. Unfortunately, the
marriage ended in divorce after only four years.
As is often the case in this situation, father and son lost touch.
However, in the months before his death, Michael had been back in
contact and was building up a close relationship with young Mike, who
shared his father's passion for Celtic. Mike, now aged 11, would spend
weekends in Oxford and Spike was very much a devoted father.
With the break-up of his marriage Mike moved to Bristol, where he
worked on his PhD at South Mead Hospital. It was also at Bristol that he
met Jenny, who was to play an important part of his life for the next
five years. Later, it was to develop into a stormy relationship, with
Jenny demonstrating intense jealousy. At Bristol, Mike continued with
volleyball, playing in the first division of the English national
league.
Spike and Jenny seemed a perfectly normal couple when they moved into
18 Monks Close, Blackbird Leys, after Mike took up his research job at
the Sir William Dunn School four years ago. With a salary of only
#18,000, together with Jenny's pay from her job at a bookshop, they
could not afford a lavish lifestyle.
His work focused on the study of the molecular biology of proteins
involved in cell adhesion. The research, carried out under a Wellcome
Foundation grant, tried to establish how cells communicate with each
other and how this might go wrong in diseases.
The work suited Spike down to the ground. He loved Oxford's academic
life and got on well with the other members of the research team. He
also loved the fact that his job did not involve regular hours.
He was perfectly happy to go into his laboratory in the middle of the
night should a culture require his attention. He was more than pleased
that he could have a long lie in the morning. During the summer he and
Jenny would sunbathe in their garden overlooking some spare ground and
allotments.
But the relationship was turning sour. The police were called after
one major row. There was a break-up and an attempted reconciliation.
Two and a half years ago Spike had discovered Oxford Park volleyball
team. As happens to many players, his knees had been giving him trouble
and he had given up the game. However, his old enthusiasm came bounding
back. Oxford Park had been in the fourth division of the English
national league, but had dropped out as the best players moved on.
Coach Rod Ireland is hugely ambitious, and in Spike he found a
soulmate who could help take the team back into the big time. They
became great friends. Rod is a Wolverhampton Wanderers supporter, and he
and Spike had a common bond over football teams that had seen better
days.
Rod smiles as he recalls Spike's Scottish irreverence. ''From the
start, I was 'Baldy' to him . . . for obvious reasons.''
Everyone who came across Spike recalls his two great passions:
Scotland and Celtic. He was deeply proud of his Scottishness and his
working-class background, and was devoted to his mother who had been
widowed on her birthday. He always made sure he was with her on that
anniversary.
Like just about everybody else who lived on Blackbird Leys estate,
Spike reckoned the area had been given a bad press. About 50% of the
houses are now privately owned, and like anywhere else there are good
and bad elements. However, he almost certainly felt slightly
uncomfortable on the few occasions he supped a pint in the Blackbird
public house, a short stroll from his home.
The pub is on the road where the kids set up their hotting shows --
they still go on, but nowadays they are only occasional and the teenage
drivers have to manoeuvre the stolen cars around islands and over
sleeping policemen put up by the local council. In the past there had
been truncheon charges and near rioting around here. Even today it is
reckoned there is a lot of drug trafficking going on.
But Mike was not into that kind of scene, nor was he a heavy drinker.
His favourite tipple was Irn Bru. His life revolved around work and
volleyball. He loved nights out with the team. He especially enjoyed a
laser quest tournament -- a hugely competitive combat scene in which
opponents shoot space guns that fire nothing more dangerous than
ultraviolet lights.
Certainly, Mike was competitive. Volleyball can be a noisy sport, with
players shouting out team chants and swopping high and low fives after a
point is scored. He ''whooped'' louder than anyone else in the court --
cursing himself when he played a bad shot, but never criticising anyone
else.
He had a tremendous sense of humour and loved laughter. ''He was
always telling jokes, making himself the brunt,'' said team-mate Dr
Chris Blakewell, a fellow scientist. ''Most of the time we could not
understand his accent. But he was great fun to be with.''
It was through volleyball that Spike was to meet Denise Holt, a
34-year-old mother of three young children. Rod Ireland had taken Oxford
Park and a women's team to a tournament in Surrey in July, 1993. They
were one woman short, and a Tannoy message for a volunteer produced
Denise.
Like Mike she had a PhD, and they got on like a house on fire. By
coincidence they met again in August in Gloucester, and began to keep in
touch. ''Mike was a big softy really. He would send her long letters. He
also ordered flowers through Interflora.''
It was after his wife Jenny found one of those Interflora receipts
that their relationship ended. According to friends a weight had been
lifted from Spike's shoulders. He loved playing with Denise's three
young children. It was difficult to work out who was the biggest kid.
They also believe it was through this experience that he rekindled a
relationship with his own son.
Mike realised that he had been offered a second lease on life. Long
letters and expensive phone calls were not enough. He and Denise decided
to live together, and Mike was planning to move to her home in
Birmingham when he was shot.
He had worked out that if he kept his Cowley home going he could fit
in work and volleyball at Oxford while living with Denise in Birmingham.
He could travel between the two cities if he spent a couple of nights a
week at his Cowley home. A date had been set in January for his move to
Birmingham.
First on the agenda was a visit to Scotland to spend Christmas with
his mother.
''What we are really missing is answers,'' said Rod. ''All of us want
to know how this could happen to a guy like Spike.''
So, too, would the Thames Valley police force which, unusually, has
offered a #10,000 reward for information leading to the capture and
conviction of the killer. They reckoned that had there been some
underworld involvement in the murder, then this reward would bring a
result.
It could be cost-effective if it helped shorten the investigation, but
the force also has a duty to apprehend quickly a ruthless killer.
However, so far the reward has not produced information of any
significance.
Detective Superintendent David Blair is from the modern school of
police officers. ''We are considering just about everything except
suicide,'' he said.
He admits to being a great fan of Chief Inspector Morse, and does not
worry too much about comparisons being made over this case with the
popular television drama on which filming of one more series is about to
begin.
Dr Meenaghan's academic colleagues have been questioned, but Supt
Blair never really believed that line of inquiry would provide any kind
of genuine lead. ''You might find it in fiction,'' he said, ''but in
reality it doesn't happen like that.''
So far, around 800 people have been interviewed and more than 150
statements taken, but this has produced little to go on. Naturally,
those involved in a relationship with the victim have been closely
questioned. This area has been throughly investigated.
By accident or design, the manner of the killing has meant that there
was no forensic evidence left at the scene. Police have searched the
ground nearby, allotments, streams, ditches, and drains, but have not
found the murder weapon or a cartridge. Even today they don't know
whether the murder weapon was a single or double-barrelled shotgun.
Certainly, many people heard the shot. Some thought it was a car
backfiring, others that a firework had been let off. But there were also
those who were convinced it was a gun being fired.
Two doors down from the murder house, Mrs Barbara Andrews said it was
no louder than a champagne bottle being popped. ''In fact, I thought one
of my light-bulbs upstairs had gone.''
There were a few potential witnesses around at the time, but none saw
anything. The safest escape route for the killer would have been over
the fence at the back garden and across the allotments. However, whoever
it was could easily have gone down the side of the house and out the
front gate under cover of darkness.
There have been many theories.Could it have been a burglary that went
wrong? After all, Dr Meenaghan had been burgled just over a year
previously and this had led to him changing locks and fitting window
catches.
He also went ex-directory after his phone rang on several occasions,
but no-one spoke. He thought it might be the burglar, considering a
second raid, checking to see if the house was empty. But burglars don't
normally carry shotguns.
Could it have been a contract killing? Professional assassins do not
normally take out victims with a single shot. They would fire more than
once to ensure the victim was dead. Indeed, they would be unlikely to
use a shotgun in the first place. If it was a hit, then it was a very
unusual contract. Significantly, there has been no suggestion from
anyone that Dr Meenaghan was in fear of his life.
Because of the nature of the killing, police have also thoroughly
examined the possibility that there might have been a drug motive. But
this line of inquiry has led nowhere.
Currently, the police are investigating the possibility that this
might have been a case of mistaken identity. Houses in the area with No
18 in the address are being visited. So too are those in similar
locations -- overlooking allotments, for example. People throughout
Oxford with a similar appearance, especially those with a criminal
background, are also being questioned.
That might not be as arduous a task as at first might seem. After all
Dr Meenaghan, at 6ft 3ins and with long, dark hair often tied in a
ponytail, was quite distinctive.
A police investigation on this scale is a process of elimination.
While the lines of the inquiry have now been narrowed, Supt Blair makes
it clear that nothing has yet been ruled out.But a sense of frustration
remains, not only for the police, but also for Spike's closest friends.
Although Denise is involved in post-trauma stress counselling, she has
so far been unable to return to her work.
Spike having died intestate, the house in Monks Close will now be
inherited by his son. Denise, however, was given permission to return
there to collect some personal possessions and Spike's volleyball kit,
which will go to his club where it will be kept as a memento.
Accompanied by police officers, Denise paid an emotional visit to the
house last week. There she found Mike's Christmas present to her -- a
ring. The visit took place on St Valentine's Day.
Her children, aged nine, seven, and three, miss Spike terribly. They
have been told he died in a car crash, but children of that age seem to
have a sixth sense and they know there is more to it than that.
Describing happy nights with Spike, watching football on television
over a can of beer and visits to see Wolves play, Rod Ireland shook his
head and recalled: ''We had planned a visit to Scotland this year to go
to a Celtic match. None of us can comprehend why this should have
happened. It is still impossible to believe he is dead. I thought when I
attended Spike's funeral in Scotland with my partner, Jackie, that I
would be able to let it go. But that has not happened. It was a
beautiful service and I got to meet his friends from childhood.
''But the void is still there. What we all want is an answer. But
there is no answer.''

TORY Euro-rebels and Ulster Unionists decided yesterday to keep the
Prime Minister guessing about how they will vote at the end of
Wednesday's Commons vote on Europe. Their votes or abstentions probably
will determine whether the Government wins or loses.
One of the Tories who lost the whip over Europe, Mr Tony Marlow
(Northampton North) said: ''We will wait and see what the Prime Minister
says during the debate.'' His eight colleagues provided variants of the
same line.
In Belfast, the Ulster Unionists held talks on their tactics, some
arguing that they should tear up their agreement to support Mr Major to
show their anger at the framework document on the future of Northern
Ireland. Their Chief Whip, Mr William Ross said that he could see his
party voting against Mr Major. If they did, the Labour motion that the
Commons does not support the Government's European policy could be
carried, forcing a vote of confidence the following day.
Some Conservative Euro-sceptics who still take the whip were saying
they have still to decide how to vote. Mr Bill Cash (Stafford) said: ''I
am going to make up my mind on Wednesday.''
All this may give Ministers an anxious weekend, but the Government
whips are fairly confident that they can defeat the Labour motion, even
if not by much.
Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said in a radio interview that he
believed Labour would lose because it had made its tactics too obvious.
''You are not usually very successful if you set a trap in the full view
of the people you hope will fall into it -- and that is what Labour has
done,'' he said.
The Prime Minister, who is putting his authority on the line by
opening the debate instead of Mr Hurd, said in Glasgow that the debate
could put right many misunderstandings that people had about the
Government's European policy.
However, Shadow Foreign Secretary Robin Cook countered Mr Hurd's claim
by saying that in deciding to open the debate ''Mr Major has set a trap
for himself and walked straight into it.''
He said Mr Major would be asked what were the Conservative conditions
for joining a single currency, whether they would sign up if the
conditions were met and whether he agreed with Chancellor Kenneth Clarke
that a single currency did not threaten the nation state.
Mr Cook added ''If he answers them, he risks splitting the
Conservative benches. If he ducks them, he will reveal that the
Government has no answer to the really big questions facing Europe.''
Party divisions on Europe were vividly illustrated in the Commons when
pro and anti-EU Tory MPs clashed during a debate on the Bill introduced
by Euro-sceptic Mrs Teresa Gorman (Billericay) to hold a referendum
later this year. This was to offer a choice of going forward to a
federal Europe or seeking wide repatriation of powers to Westminster and
retaining mainly the free trade area.
Mrs Gorman claimed the Bill was ''an olive branch'' to the Prime
Minister but Foreign Office Minister Tony Baldry said it offered ''an
absurd choice'' which reduced ''to the ridiculous the debate on our
future role in Europe.''
Tempers frayed further when, with only five minutes to go, Mrs Angela
Knight (Erewash), Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Chancellor,
rose to speak.
As she did so, Sir Teddy Taylor (Southend East) crept behind the bench
from which she was speaking and examined the papers on it. Mr Tim Smith
(Beaconsfield) seized one, but not before Sir Teddy had told Mrs Gorman
that it was an appeal to Mrs Knight to speak past 2.30 pm, automatically
preventing a vote on the Bill.
Mrs Gorman then moved the closure of the debate to try to secure a
vote. The closure was carried by 24 votes to two but not enough MPs had
voted to validate the decision. Discussion ended without a decision
being taken, effectively killing the Bill, for which no further time is
likely to be available.

* I WANNA go back to Dixie/ I wanna be a Dixie pixie/ I wanna eat corn
pone 'til it's coming out of my ears/ I want juleps on the lawn again/
And get my white sheet on again/ I ain't seen one good lynching in years
. . . Thus the musical satirist Tom Lehrer, strictly in jest. How
strange that witty old New York liberal would find it, 30-odd years on,
to hear a black man saying much the same thing in earnest, only without
the white sheets and the lynchings.
In South Of Haunted Dreams: A Ride Through Slavery's Old Back Yard
(Penguin, #6.99), black Northern writer Eddy L Harris takes a long
motorcycle swing through the lands south of the Mason-Dixon line,
looking for trouble but having trouble finding it. Harris is no white
man's nigger, and he writes humanely and well, but his reconciliation
with the land of cotton (''It felt like home'') is a shade naive in the
way it ignores the difference between being a tourist and having to live
there, and between being an educated and fairly affluent writer and
being a minimum-wage employee in North Carolina.
Anyway, if it really feels like home, why isn't he planning to stay
there?
Ethan Canin writes from a different planet, that of liberal Jewish
middle America, but the four novellas in The Palace Thief (Abacus,
#6.99) share Harris's tolerance and kindness, without his romantic
sentimentality. Stories of a grey accountant envious of his vulgar but
more successful old schoolmate; a younger brother growing up in the
shadow of a boy genius; an old schoolmaster disappointed in a former
pupil; and a would-be-hip father trying to keep up with his piously
radical student son -- these wry tales of chances missed and roads not
taken have a gentle, understated wit and forgiveness that is
cumulatively very endearing.
If you want the fireworks-and-laughter side of Jewish-American
literature, try Philip Roth; but Canin's smaller yet equally potent
voice is well worth hearing too.
Another four novellas. Stephen King's Different Seasons (Warner,
#5.99) -- including the prison story Rita Hayworth And Shawshank
Redemption, coming soon to a cinema near you -- proves (a) that Stephen
King can write more than horror, (b) that he has an unsuspected sense of
humour, but also (c) that he can only write in the flat, dry,
superficial style that American creative-writing courses teach to their
students, and mostly from Stephen King novels at that. Easy to read, but
then cheeseburgers are easy to eat.

A FAMILY doctors' practice which removed 50 patients from its
treatment list has agreed to take them back after intervention by
Lanarkshire Health Board.
The board stepped in after it emerged that the group practice of
Goudie, Bell and Tilley had written earlier this week to the patients,
who include a number of elderly pensioners, informing them they would no
longer be treated at their surgery in Motherwell Health Centre.
The patients were given no indication of the reasons behind their
exclusion, but it is understood they were selected for removal after the
practice conducted a computer survey of their full patient list.
Last night, Labour MP Brian Donohoe said he planned to bring an early
day motion before the House of Commons next week calling for legislation
to give patients the right to appeal against removal from a GP's list.
He has produced research showing 5000 Scottish patients a year suffered
the same fate.
The MP's proposed legislation also would let patients find out why
they were being excluded.
The Scottish Office last night confirmed that the Motherwell practice
were not fund-holding GPs.
A health board spokesman said last night: ''We were alerted to this
situation -- which is unprecedented in my experience -- by our primary
care director, and immediately contacted the practice.
''After discussions with health board officials, the practice has
decided to restore these patients to their list.''
A receptionist at the health practice yesterday said: ''The doctors
don't want to talk about it.''
Drs Alexander Goudie, Laurence Bell and Marelle Tilley operate the
group practice.
Dr Bell and Dr Tilley refused to comment last night as they left the
Motherwell Health Centre.
One patient affected is a Motherwell widow in her late eighties who
suffers from the bone disorder osteoporosis, who had been registered
with the practice for more than 60 years.
The widow's minister, the Rev William Bruce, discovered the distress
caused by the letter when he visited her home.
She said last night she did not wish to be named, but Mr Bruce said:
''She showed me the letter when I visited her on Monday night as it had
caused her a good deal of distress.''
He then contacted Motherwell South MP Dr Jeremy Bray, who immediately
called the Lanarkshire Health Board to check the situation.
The Labour MP said: ''It is shocking. She has been with the practice
60 years -- they brought her two sons into the world. The letter she
received was extremely bald and gave her no reason for their decision.''
Dr Bray's call to the board came at the same time as an internal
investigation had got under way, which resulted ultimately in the
practice's abrupt U-turn.
Mr Donohoe, MP for Cunninghame South, has produced statistics showing
that 20,000 patients were removed from GP's lists across Scotland
between 1990 and 1993.
''This is an extremely worrying trend. What is more invidious is that
the individuals are given no reason why they should be refused treatment
nor do they have any right of appeal,'' he said last night.

<HEADLINE>Trapped paddle steamer faces financial ruin as argument goes on over repairs to damaged structure.  Bridge row threatens to sink Waverley</HEADLINE>

ONE of the Clyde's best-loved leisure attractions, the paddle steamer
Waverley, is facing financial ruin while the Glasgow Development Agency
and the management of the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre are
entrenched in an argument over the future of Bell's Bridge.
The world's last sea-going paddler remains trapped in her berth at
Glasgow's Anderston Quay, upriver of the bridge, while the two bodies
deliberate about what should be done to repair the swing bridge and its
access. The bridge cannot be opened following damage by floods in
December.
Mr David Duncanson, general manager of Waverley Excursions, which
employs 40 full-time staff during the peak season, said yesterday: ''The
entire future of this company is now at risk.''
The Herald can reveal the Waverley's future now looks dire while the
GDA and the SECC remain at loggerheads over the pedestrian bridge,
erected as a temporary structure for the 1988 Glasgow Garden Festival.
The Waverley is due to steam through the bridge on March 6 prior to
entering the Garvel drydock at Greenock for the final stages of a
#350,000 refit.
However, embarrassed officials of the GDA, which owns the bridge and
whose main remit is to stimulate economic development, privately admit
the Waverley could be going nowhere because of the apparent
intransigence of the SECC, which owns the damaged north quay wall and is
at odds with the GDA over the long-term future of the bridge.
GDA officials have been startled by the latest fax from Mr Mike
Closier, SECC chief executive, which suggests the best solution might be
for the agency to deploy giant cranes.
He said: ''In the spirit of co-operation, I ask if you or your
engineers have considered alternative methods of remedial action for the
bridge which would not require access to the damaged site. I have in
mind the lifting of the bridge using floating cranes or even a static
crane positioned on your property to the south of the river.''
The official response from the GDA yesterday was that the floating
crane option would cost in the region of #100,000 and take at least two
months to complete. The agency believes the bridge is not badly damaged
and could be fixed in a matter of weeks.
A GDA spokesman said: ''We have a contractor, ready, willing, and able
to go in and do the necessary repair work. Our contractor is convinced
he can complete it within two weeks at a cost of #20,000.''
However, the SECC management, which owns the north quayside --
requiring repairs which could run into hundreds of thousands of pounds
-- remains adamant the GDA's contractors will not be allowed access to
the bridge until the SECC insurers have given the all-clear.
The exchange of notes over the crippled bridge highlights a fierce
divergence of opinion between the GDA and the SECC, both of which have
multi-million pound plans for developments on the banks of the Clyde.
SECC Ltd is pursuing a #30m project to extend the centre in time for
the international Rotary conference in 1997, which is expected to
generate #20m of income. It is understood the company considers Bell's
Bridge to be an obstruction to this development plan and favours having
it removed completely.
The Herald also understands the management of both the SECC and the
Moat House International Hotel have been unahappy about the presence of
''undesirables'' in the precincts of the bridge late at night.
The GDA plans an #80m development of part of the former Garden
Festival site, now known as Pacific Quay, on the south side of the
river. It clearly views the bridge as a structure that can be
revitalised as an important link.
A GDA insider confirmed: ''We are committed to the bridge and there is
currently a Bill going through Parliament to make it a permanent link
across the Clyde.''
The Waverley has been cruising the Clyde since 1975 after being
donated for a pound to the Paddle Steamer Preservation Society by her
former owners, the Scottish Transport Group.
At the end of October, she steamed through Bell's Bridge back to her
long-established berth at Anderston Quay adjacent to which she has
extensive office and workshop facilities. Then came the floods.
Waverley Excursions general manager Mr Duncanson said: ''There has
been a lot of talk about a spirit of co-operation but, as things stand,
it looks as if we will be unable to get as far as Greenock for our
annual overhaul. We have overcome many obstacles in our time but this
one is amazing.
''We are due at Garvel drydock on March 13 for a two-week stay at a
cost of between #20,000 and #25,000 and had planned to resume public
sailings at Easter. If we don't get there, there is no guarantee when we
can find another slot. If we are unable to dock the steamer at Greenock,
we won't get a Department of Transport passenger certificate and will
effectively cease to operate.''

DURING Ramadan, which runs this year between February 1 and March 2,
Muslims are supposed to stop eating a couple of hours before sunrise.
You can't eat, drink, or smoke -- as part of a general discipline. That
restriction goes on until sunset. I had a glass of water, my usual
routine, when I got up about 5.15. Between 5.30 and 5.45 I had toast and
honey and a half-boiled egg; tea with milk and a little sugar. That was
that. Then I embarked on the fast.
At 5.36 in the evening it was time to break the fast. There's a
tradition of breaking it with one or two dates. Then I had a glass of
freshly squeezed orange juice, and a dish of fresh fruit salad. After
that came evening prayers. Then my wife started making the proper meal.
It consisted of pilau rice and curried lamb, eaten about 6.30. The sweet
was fresh figs. During Ramadan there are late evening prayers before
retiring. They lasted from 8.45 until 10.15. Then I had cheese with
grapes and a couple of dates, after that a glass of hot milk. Then I
went to bed.

<HEADLINE>Foot to sue over claims he spied for the KGB</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>979681565</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
FORMER Labour leader Mr Michael Foot is to sue over allegations that
he was a KGB spy, his solicitor announced yesterday.
Mr David Price said the allegations accusing Mr Foot of treachery to
his country were so grave that he had decided to take legal action.
Libel proceedings had been issued against Mr Rupert Murdoch and Times
Newspapers, and News Group Newspapers over articles which appeared in
the Sunday Times and the News of the World on February 19.
Mr Price said that during Mr Foot's long career as a politician and
journalist he had suffered, without complaint, ''a good many unjust or
untrue statements in the media''. But he added: ''These allegations,
however, accuse him of treachery to his country and have been made even
though the Sunday Times had every reason to believe that they were
untrue.
''He holds Mr Murdoch personally responsible for this McCarthyite
semar which was published as front page news.''
The Sunday Times alleged that the KGB regarded Mr Foot as one of their
''agents of influence'' in Britain during the 1960s and that it made
payments to the left-wing newspaper, Tribune. But Mr Foot, 81, dismissed
the story as ''a big lie'', described the allegations as
''disgraceful''.
One of the former Soviet agents quoted in the Sunday Times distanced
himself from the allegations, claiming to have been ''misrepresented''.
The editor of the Sunday Times, Mr John Witherow, admitted on radio
that claims that Mr Foot was a KGB agent ''may be utter rubbish''. But
he said last night that the libel action would be ''vigorously''
defended.

A 75-YEAR-old Scottish Nationalist who says the Treaty of Union is not
legal is prepared to go to prison rather than pay a road tax of #150
''to the British Government''.
Former bailie William Gilmour appeared yesterday at Cumbernauld
District Court, where he once sat on the bench, and said he would pay
the back duty only to a Scottish parliament despite being told that if
he did not pay in 21 days he would face a seven-day prison sentence.
He plans to write to Scottish Secretary Ian Lang, but admits if his
proposal is not accepted, ''I will have to go to Barlinnie.''
Mr Gilmour, of Braeface Road, Cumbernauld was facing a means inquiry
into why he had not paid the #150 back duty for non-payment of his road
tax. The original demand was dated February 18, 1992. At that time he
paid a #100 fine for not having road tax because, he said, the money
would remain in Scotland. However, he refused to pay the tax itself.
At two subsequent means inquiries Mr Gilmour, a great grandfather, had
been ordered to pay the road tax at #5 per week: he made no promise to
do so.
0 Yesterday Mr Gilmour, who was a bailie at the Cumbernauld court from
1970-1975, told the court: ''I dislike having to pay road tax to a
foreign body, Westminster in other words, so I have written a letter to
all three main political parties . . .
''I can pay the #150, but what concerns me is where it's going. I
asked the local district council and they said it's going to the
Treasury and I'm unhappy with that.''
In the letter, shown to the court, Mr Gilmour explained that he felt
the Treaty of Union was brought about by corrupt means. He said he had
dissociated himself from England on grounds of conscience. He objected
to England's export of arms. He wrote: ''I wish to have the status of a
conscientious objector.''
It was explained to Mr Gilmour that the court's role was not to judge
on political matters, but to ascertain his means of paying the duty.
When asked if he would pay, Mr Gilmour said: ''No, I'm afraid this goes
against my conscience and I don't want to do that.''
The court was then adjourned for a duty solicitor to be found to
explain the severe implications of his stance: Mr Gilmour said one would
be of no use and to proceed.
JP Ronald Manson, said: ''I will allow you 21 days to recover payment
of the fine. If full payment is made then the matter is clear. If the
full sum is not paid I will have to impose an alternative of seven days
imprisonment.''
The clerk of the court, Mrs Jane Hackett, said if the back duty were
not paid by March 17 a warrant for his imprisonment would be issued.
Outside the court, Mr Gilmour said: ''I'm quite willing to pay the
#150 but not to an English treasury. I will just have to go to Barlinne.
I managed to survive five years in a war without surrendering. I just
hope that I get a victory out of this for Scotland.''

THE management of the controversial Hanger 13 nightclub in Ayr will
have to wait at least two months before learning whether it can remain
open.
A sheriff yesterday agreed that consideration of an appeal against the
suspension of their entertainment licence should be postponed until
April 21.
Sheriff Francis Reeves also ruled that, as well as Kyle and Carrick
district licensing board defending its decision to take the licence
away, the chief constable of Strathclyde can also make submissions as
second respondent.
The board met last November after a complaint from the chief constable
that the continuation of the licence for the Pavilion, in which Hanger
13 is staged each Saturday, could constitute a threat to public order or
safety.
Mr Leslie Sharp had made his complaint after three young men who had
attended dance events at Hanger 13 died from the effects of taking the
drug ecstasy.
The owners, McCall's Entertainments, immediately lodged an appeal with
the sheriff court and have been allowed to operate as normal while the
legal process continues.
In court yesterday, legal representatives of Kyle and Carrick District
Council and Strathclyde police submitted written answers to the points
raised by the owners in their writ which argues that the decision was
legally wrong.
At the April hearing, the two solicitors will make preliminary pleas
as to the competency of the appeal. Should the sheriff agree with them,
the licence will remain suspended. Should he reject the pleas, the
matter will go to a further hearing at which all arguments will be put.
In May of last year, Mr John Nisbet, 18, of New Cumnock, and Mr Andrew
Dick, 19, of Glasgow, died after taking ecstasy. In August, a third
victim, Mr Andrew Stoddart, 20, of Rigside, died after taking the drug
in Hanger 13.
Sheriff Neil Gow, QC, warned of the dangers of taking ecstasy after a
fatal accident inquiry into the deaths. He said: ''A dance with ecstasy
can lead to a dance with death.''
Meanwhile, the Nisbet family's MP, Mr George Foulkes, has called for a
change in the legislation which has allowed the Pavilion to continue
operating as normal while the appeal process continued.
He said: ''It does seem strange that, when the chief constable warns
of a danger to public order and safety and a cross-party group of
councillors agrees, the club is allowed to operate as normal for many
months after the decision.
''I welcome, however, the agreement that the chief constable should be
permitted to take part, through his legal representative, in the appeal
procedure. He has an important to play.''

THE Prime Minister said last night his mission was to prevent the
Scottish people unwittingly ''sleepwalking'' their way towards
independence.
Mr Major, in a keynote speech in Glasgow, showed no let-up in his
vehement opposition to constitutional change.
However, by refusing to accept his proposed devolved assembly for
Northern Ireland set a precedent for Scotland, he attracted the scorn
and anger of political opponents in the wake of an earlier BBC Scotland
radio interview.
The Scottish TUC claimed his ill-informed comments proved that for him
Scotland was already a foreign country.
SNP leader Alex Salmond described the Glasgow speech as ''cauld kale
het up''. He said: ''John Major says that he does not want the Scottish
people to 'sleepwalk' to independence. It is the Prime Minister who has
his eyes and ears shut to the realities of Scottish politics. Scotland
is already dreaming of a new future, free of the burden of London
government.''
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson said: ''Mr Major has shown
he is inconsistent, out of touch, and a real danger to the unity of
Britain. By offering Scotland nothing, in this of all weeks, he is being
not just patronising, but provocative.''
The Scottish Liberal Democrat leader, Mr Jim Wallace, said: ''Having
set the precedent with the Northern Ireland assembly, he is now
splashing about desperately to keep his head above water, and not
cutting a very convincing figure.''
Despite these attacks, at a Tory fund-raising dinner last night what
emerged from Mr Major's speech was a defiant restatement of his belief
in the Union and the inherent danger of constitutional change.
''The sovereign will of any part of the United Kingdom must prevail,''
he said. ''That is true for the people of Northern Ireland. It is true
also in Scotland. If the people of Scotland ever decided they wanted to
leave the UK, they would do so. We could not stop them.
''But what we can do, and what I shall do tonight is to argue that it
is not in Scotland's interest to embark upon a route that could lead to
separation.''
However, while he has previously conceded a majority vote for the SNP
would constitute an expression of that sovereign will, there was no
indication in his speech of any recognition that a vote for either of
the two parties espousing the devolutionary path would amount to such an
expression.
He stressed the differences between Scotland and Northern Ireland,
contrasting sectarianism which created 250 years of suspicion and 25
years of killing across the water, with three centuries of peace,
prosperity, and growing world influence in Scotland.
But his appeal was ''both emotional and pragmatic'', involving ties of
''history, of blood and shared experience over many centuries''.
The strength of the Union was its diversity and flexibility, ''based
on consent, not repression.'' He added: ''I don't want to see the
Scottish people sleepwalking into a decision which will damage and
weaken Scotland and throw away all the opportunities you have earned
over the past two decades.''
Like Oliver Twist, he claimed, a tax-raising Scottish assembly would
constantly be asking for more, would damage business, and would fall out
with Westminster in ''inevitable squabbles'' which would benefit only
those seeking independence.
A cut in the number of Scottish MPs at Westminster would be to the
advantage of the Conservatives. ''To remove a large proportion of Labour
MPs by consigning them to a Scottish assembly might mean near-perpetual
Conservative majorities at Westminster,'' he said, but they were
prepared to pay ''a heavy price electorally for standing up for the
Union''.
He painted a glowing picture of the Scottish economy, with trends in
unemployment and output better than in the South, and the reversal of
historic migration patterns.
''This isn't the time to scratch and infect the sore of separatism,''
he said. ''This isn't the time to stir ill-feeling between the different
parts of the UK. Let's resist this negative instinct to turn our backs
on our closest neighbours in sullen and isolationist resentment.''
Urging Scots to steer away from a ''constitutional maelstrom,'' he
said: ''You are a success story. The Union is a success story. The rest
of the world admires you and all that you have done. Don't throw it away
because someone tells you the grass is greener on the other side.''

GRAMPIAN Regional Council claimed a ''good housekeeping'' exercise
yesterday over the next council tax.
It said the tax payers ''may not even be aware'' of the cuts it has
been forced to make.
The budget proposals for 1995-96 which the SNP/Liberal Democrat joint
administration is proposing will add #20 a year or 40p a week to average
household bills.
The region faced a #31m shortfall ''following a Government grant
settlement which even Scottish Secretary Ian Lang had admitted was
'tight'.
''I think most people will find these increases reasonable at a time
when the Government are deliberately reducing their contribution to the
cost of council services,'' said Councillor Pearl Paul, finance
committee chairman.
The committee was particularly pleased that, although there would be
substantial reductions in the education budget, the region's biggest,
teacher staffing levels would be maintained.
The main reason the council is able to curtail tax rises is the
controversial sale of prime industrial sites which raised #23m towards
the shortfall. Another measure has been to seek early retirement by
staff members over 50.
The remainder of the savings had been made through economies in
administration and the non-replacement of furniture and equipment.
''When Tory Ministers speak about it being 'tight' what they really
mean is that it is going to hurt and it would really have hurt if we had
passed the shortfall directly on to the council taxpayer,'' said Mrs
Paul. ''It would have meant a #170 hike in the Band D tax, a rise of
43%, which would have been completely unacceptable and unbearable to the
poor taxpayer.''
Primary school meal prices will rise by 8p to 95p as a result of the
budget, and there will be a 10% rise in secondary school cafeteria
prices from August.
However, the 10p concession bus fare for senior citizens and the
handicapped will be maintained, and an additional #1m will be invested
in snow clearing and road gritting operations and improved road safety
measures at schools. Cold weather assistance would also be stepped up.
Councillor Rhona Kemp, the region's vice-convener, said that without
the sale of the industrial sites, services would have been cut and there
would have been compulsory redundancies. They would even have had to
look at reducing the number of teachers.
She said they had followed the maxim ''many a mickle maks a muckle''
and had achieved the bulk of the required savings through reductions on
administration costs, and replacement of furniture.
Councillor Gordon McDonald, convener, said services were bound to be
affected to some extent but he believed what they had achieved would be
appreciated by the people of Grampian, particularly when they saw the
effects of the Government cuts on other regions.
The proposals will be put to the council meeting of March 6.

Drew Allan takes a mystery tour through Prague
I'M SORRY, Mr Owersby. I really am. But I still say it wasn't all my
fault. You see, I'd been told that those nice people from the Czech
Tourist Agency would be at the airport to meet me, so when I came
through Customs and saw the man with the placard which read ALLEN
OWERSBY, I naturally assumed he was there to meet me, and, of course,
you as well. Well, anyone would, wouldn't they?
So when I approached this chap and said: ''Excuse me, I'm Allan,'' and
he turned on his heels and motioned for me to follow, I naturally
assumed you were already ensconsed in the car. Well, anyone would,
wouldn't they?
But when I was safely installed in the back seat of the car (a very
nice Renault, not a Skoda, rather plush, you would have approved) and he
immediately sped off, still without a word, and I realised that you
weren't there, it was only then that I realised that perhaps I was in
the wrong car; perhaps my silent companion was there to pick up a Mr
Allen Owersby. But since the aforesaid companion had no English, and
failed to respond to my hopelessly dated schoolboy French and German, I
had no option but to settle back, try to enjoy the journey, and wonder
where on earth I was being taken. Well, anyone would, wouldn't they?
So that was why, Mr Owersby, I found myself, 20 minutes later,
standing outside a grey, imposing, startlingly cold-looking apartment,
somewhere in a dingy, depressing quarter of Prague, still without a word
having being uttered by our now-departed friend. You, presumably, would
have felt completely at home; alas, for me, it was quite the reverse.
But this was where I learned my first, and most lasting, impression of
Prague. Though becoming ever more popular with tourists, its people
still have a long way to go before becoming as adept at languages as
their peers in Germany, France, Greece, even Turkey, for heaven's sake;
but they are friendly, and desperately eager to oblige. Witness the
little old lady in the apartment block, who shaking her head pityingly
at the pathetic foreigner who could only flutter a hotel reservation and
whine: ''Pardonnez-moi, Madame, mais ou est l'Hotel Moran?'' stoically
lifted my bag, despite my protestations, scuttled across the street, and
helpfully laid it at the foot of a tram stop. She then ran her finger
down the timetable affixed there, pointed to the word ''Moran'' four
lines down, and, with a smile, left me to it.
This was where I picked up my second impression of Prague. The public
transport system is very, very good. Especially for confused travellers
with no Czech money on them. I hopped on the tram that arrived within
five minutes, shuffled surreptitiously to the back, and slipped off four
stops later at a terminus obligingly labelled in large letters, MORAN.
I'm truly sorry, Mr Owersby, that my first act on Czech soil was to
illegally hitch a ride on a tram, but I tried to salve my conscience by
tipping prodigiously over the next few days. Indeed the first person I
met, the porter at the Hotel Moran, probably has that 50-dollar
traveller's cheque framed. I hope you're not too ashamed of me.
My colleague, Carl MacDougall, tells you on these pages what you have
missed if, perish the thought, you're still hanging around Prague
Airport waiting for your lift. Rest assured that, though you may not
have much enjoyed your visit, I certainly did. I spent a happy three
days marvelling at the architecture, revelling in the atmosphere of a
city looking out into the sunshine after decades of gloom, marvelling at
the musicality of its people. And, above all, grateful for their
indulgence.

<HEADLINE>Union warns of 1000 further job losses</HEADLINE>

THE planned closure of Rolls-Royce's East Kilbride aero-engine design
plant could lead to a further 1000 job losses in the town, union
officials claimed last night.
The company intends to transfer 500 skilled engineering support jobs
from Scotland to Derby and Bristol and to axe 100 shop floor posts as
part of a corporate restructuring scheme.
Now union leaders say the neighbouring R-R aero-engine services site
will face a short, bleak future if the closure of the design and
development factory is allowed to go ahead.
Scottish TUC general secretary Campbell Christie said yesterday that
the campaign to save the jobs was desperately short of time. R-R is
expected to begin the transfer of work by late April.
He added: ''The threat of transfer is imminent. But it is not just
another closure threat to Lanarkshire, bad as that is. It is a threat to
the very type of jobs we need to keep in Scotland if we are to have a
future in manufacturing.
''Scottish Secretary Ian Lang should be knocking doors and asking what
the hell is going on here. While he continues to make idle boasts about
the burgeoning economy, he is doing nothing to stop the loss of senior
research and development jobs.''
The threatened workforce voted overwhelmingly yesterday to take
selective industrial action in pursuit of the campaign to retain the
East Kilbride facility.
Mr Owen Thomas, an official of the white-collar Manufacturing Science
and Finance Union at the design and development unit, said: ''The
viability of the adjacent aero-engine services plant and its 1000 jobs
would be severely threatened as we share major services. If one site
goes, the other site's costs would soar. The bottom line is another
closure.''
The R-R crisis is set to become a central issue at the STUC's annual
conference in Perth in seven weeks. Meanwhile, a briefing paper for
other unions and for Scottish MPs on the case for retention of the
design unit is being prepared.
A rally and demonstration of the R-R workers is to take place today in
East Kilbride to draw attention to the campaign.
